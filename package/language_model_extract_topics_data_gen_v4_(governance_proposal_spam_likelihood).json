Included in this process will be the listing of MetaHuahua NFTs on the Passage Marketplace and the integration of those NFTs into avatars (or Huavatars) within the world. \n \n Proposed Features for World Launch \n ● World Design - We will work with community delegates to create a custom world built from the ground up for the Chihuahua Community. This world could be photorealistic or heavily stylized, but either way will lean into the full power of Unreal Engine. \n ● Passage Integration - The designed world will then be converted by our team into a functioning Passage world. This means that the community will be able to play in the world on Desktop or Mobile devices through a browser without the need for any downloads. The world will be restricted to owners of MetaHuahua NFTs and $HUAHUA tokens. We will also be customizing the Passage UI to better fit the Chihuahuas brand/community aesthetic. \n ● Social Functionality - Players will be able to add friends via wallet addresses to self organize and play together while communicating via chat and with custom Chihuahua emotes. \n ● Avatar Customization - We will create chihuahua Huavatars for the community to use in conjunction with their MetaHuahuas. In addition to this, Huavatars will be customizable with a wide array of 3D accessory NFTs that will be purchasable within the world with $HUAHUA. \n ● Custom Development of 3D MetaHuahuas - We will offer community members the opportunity to have their MetaHuahua made into a 1 of 1 metaverse avatar for use in the Chihuahua Passage World, as well as other Passage worlds. This avatar will be connected to the original MetaHuahua NFT, meaning it can be considered in the value of future NFT sales. This service would be done on a first-come-first-serve basis.\n ● 3 Minigames - What is a world full of Chihuahuas without some games to play and compete in? The world will launch with 3 distinct, dog themed minigames that allow players to compete with one another. Think King of the Hill, but with pups running around marking territory. \n \n Additional Proposal Considerations \n ● NFT Minting - The Passage team will complete the minting process with the MetaHuahua team to bring the NFTs into the Passage Marketplace and make them available to the community. \n ● $PASG Private Sale - We will be bringing forward a second proposal in the very near future to provide the Chihuahua community with a Private Sale allocation of $PASG that will help fund player time and maximize accessibility to the world. \n ● Security Audit - The Passage team will engage with a Cybersecurity firm familiar with CosmWasm contracts to conduct a full audit of the tech stack used to build the Chihuahua Passage World. While this will utilize our standard tech, there are also a number of features being custom built, so we’ll want to verify the safety and security of all users with a full audit. \n \n Future Upgrades \n This scope of work has been built so that the Chihuahua Passage world can grow with future additions as we add more features to the platform and the Chihuahua community grows. \n \n Requested Funds \n The Passage team is seeking 272,000,000 $HUAHUA (approximately $785,000 USD at the time of writing) in order to fully execute this initial scope of work. \n Multisig Address: chihuahua1encclv5q4zg0xs6r5aent2j2r9mk5msyqw4ysj \n \n Liquidation Schedule \n While our team will need to liquidate funds in order to pay for development of the Chihuahua Passage World, we also want to be respectful of the $HUAHUA community and not actively damage the price by liquidating too much at once.

Officially, the chihuahua community DAO is now 4 members. Currently, the team is made up of 2 co-leads, 1 junior lead, and 1 graphic designer and 1 accountant. We also recruited 2 new mods that belong to the Israel and Persian telegram, they are currently paid as well. We have a Turkish group as well. We’ve experienced a big change in $ value regarding Chihuahua DAO compensation. Currently the monthly amount that is being compensated to the team for their work is:\n\nLeads get 1.5M each = 3M\nJunior + designer get 1M each = 2M\nRegional comm mods get 1M each = 2M\nTurkish mod gets paid 600k HUAHUA\nOur accountant = 240k HUAHUA\n\nWhich makes total of 7.84M HUAHUA / month. The last 3 months the whole payroll of the team has been in average close to 300 USD worth of HUAHUA. The amount of money we get compensated has been severely lowered. Also the last proposal was an extension for up to six months and we realized that was a mistake due to volatility. Conditions in the market change quickly and due to this, we would like to make a change regarding the funding period. We would like to change the DAO funding request period from 6 months back to 3 months.\n\nThe two leads will get $1.5K worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly  = $3K worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly in total.\nJunior international managers/designer will get $1k worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly= $2K worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly in total.\nAccounting manager will be paid 1k$ in HUAHUA tokens monthly. Regional mods will get $500 worth of HUAHUA tokens each monthly = $1.5k$ worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly in total. These payments will be split in half and paid out on the 15th and 30th. So, 3k+3k+1.5k= $7.5K worth of HUAHUA tokens each month (final value adding all the parts).\n\n\nWe have accomplished a lot for Chihuahua and continue to push the bar. We have been here for you and will continue keeping our promise, so we would appreciate the community considers this updated proposal. Some of the current stats achieved are:\n\n* Multiple different telegrams with multiple languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Italian, Persian, Russian, Turkish, Vietnamese).\n* Over 1200 followers  on Reddit.\n* 3,000 followers in the ChihuahuaDAO Twitter account and even in bear market we are increasing the community.\n* Multiple social media campaigns achieved.\n\nWe are moderating all platforms and constantly staying up to date with education and information. We have been trying to support the community as much as our abilities let us. Also we’re currently looking at different ways to connect with the community. Despite market conditions, we stay committed and passionate about the chihuahua community. We consider this isn’t a greedy proposal but a request we would highly appreciate the community understand will help us not only in the personal way but to incentivize more activities related to huahua.

One Co-lead was replaced and a few junior admins were terminated. We originally felt the volatility of $HUAHUA would be an issue and we were right.

These are highly likely to attract new liquidity and increase the number of users on a blockchain and generate the most transactions. They are also essential for users to trade their assets.\n\n# Chihuahua's native NFT marketplace\nAs of February 3rd, 2023, Chihuahua Chain already have a DEX (White Whale) where you can trade different assets. Therefore, we believe the next essential application Chihuahua needs to have is a native NFT marketplace. Why is an NFT marketplace a good thing for a L1 blockchain? Just think about what OpenSea is for Ethereum. If we translate this to Chihuahua Chain, $HUAHUA could potentially become the hub of all memes and dogs NFT collections. It can also be the hub of any NFT collections.\nHow does an NFT marketplace creates value for a blockchain?\n-  An NFT marketplace attracts new users and increases liquidity.\n-  Non-fungible tokens have demonstrated to be a crucial element in the formation and strengthening of communities within an ecosystem. Strong communities contribute to a sense of belonging and engagement with projects and blockchains. Furthermore, an NFT marketplace is necessary if we wish to enable artists and projects to launch NFTs on the Chihuahua Chain.\n\nCurrently, there are several NFT collections related to the [Chihuahua Chain](https://www.chihuahua.wtf/nfts), but these are not on the $HUAHUA blockchain. By using ICS721 and CW721 compatible contracts, these NFTs could be transferred onto the $HUAHUA blockchain and have direct use cases. Although ICS721 is not yet available, it is expected to be in the near future.\nIn conclusion, a native NFT marketplace on the $HUAHUA blockchain would have multiple positive impacts on the ecosystem.\n\n# Racoon Supply (proposer): Who are we?\nRacoon Supply was launched in January 2022 and has since established a gaming platform on Juno Network and Chihuahua Chain.

To promote growth in the NFT scene on $HUAHUA, a diverse range of artists and projects is essential, and a dedicated NFT marketplace is necessary to establish and sustain a thriving NFT community. As Racoon Supply is not funded by external sources, we are requesting financial support from the Chihuahua Community Pool to develop an open-source, permissionless NFT marketplace. The marketplace will be accessible for projects to list their collections and for users to purchase and sell NFTs using any Cosmos-native coins with active IBC channels connected to $HUAHUA.\n\n# Details of our proposal\nGiven that the Chihuahua Chain is still relatively young and has a small user base, we believe that introducing a basic non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace with essential features would be an effective way to establish an NFT presence on the $HUAHUA blockchain. As the user base grows and demands for new features arise, we can progressively enhance the platform and make adjustments as necessary.\n\n### What the NFT marketplace would look like and how it would be implemented:\n- **Visual**:\n  - A search feature for collections\n  - A profile page for each user\n  - A section for featured and trending NFTs, as well as new listings\n  - A coming up section, showcasing what's soon to be released on the marketplace\n\n- **Unique page for each NFT collection**:\n  - A project description, social media links, and additional information\n  - Information such as total volume, floor price, and number of owners\n  - A search function for NFTs within the collection, with the ability to filter by price and recently sold/listed\n  \n- **Unique page for each NFTs**:\n  - It will display all of the NFT's information and include buttons for transferring, selling, and buying\n  \n- **How would it work**:\n  - New collections will need to submit a pull request to have their information added to the frontend\n  - Users will be able to buy and sell NFTs using several native assets that have active IBC channels from and to $HUAHUA. This will bring new assets to the $HUAHUA blockchain.\n  - The marketplace will be permissionless with open-sourced smart contracts\n  \n# Funding from the community pool\nIn order to build the above NFT marketplace, we are requesting 650M from the Chihuahua Community Pool. This is approximately 65,000 USD as of January 28, 2023. These funds would be used over multiple milestones:\n\n### Milestone #0 - Preparation and planning: (1-2 weeks)\n  - 100M $HUAHUA up-front to start the project and pay the developers\n  - Release of an official plan with deliverables and a roadmap for the community\n  - Sketches of the dApp/UI and how the NFT marketplace smart contract will work\n  \n### Milestone #1 - Alpha version of the platform: (4-6 weeks)\n- 200M $HUAHUA\n- Local and testnet development\n- An alpha version of the NFT marketplace smart contract\n- An alpha version of the dApp/UI\n- Gathering feedback from the community and users regarding the alpha version\n- Smart contracts unit and integration testing\n\n### Milestone #2 - Beta version of the platform: (4-6 weeks)\n- 100M $HUAHUA\n- A beta version of the smart contract and dApp/UI\n- Users will be able to try and test the dApp and smart contract to provide feedback\n- Simulation testing to test the scalability of the frontend and smart contracts\n\n### Milestone #3 - Beta version 2 of the platform: (4-6 weeks)\n- 100M $HUAHUA\n- The final version of the smart contract and dApp will be released on the testnet and mainnet\n- Release of test contracts on the mainnet for users to try and test the dApp and smart contract\n- Gathering feedback and comments to deliver exactly what users want\n- Final round of testing on the mainnet and finalizing simulation testing in a real environment\n  \n### Milestone #4 - Release: (1-2 weeks)\n- 100M $HUAHUA\n- The official release\n- Gathering comments from users to make potential final updates/improvements\n\n### Milestone #5 - Ongoing maintenance and small improvements:\n- 50M $HUAHUA\n- Ongoing maintenance and improvements\n\n# Distribution of marketplace revenues\nWe believe that being funded by a community pool requires the beneficiary to implement a mechanism for returning money to the community pool. This makes the pool more sustainable and can be used by others. The revenues for the NFT marketplace are:\n- 4.20% of all sales\n- A listing fee of 6.9 $HUAHUA\n\nBelow is how we propose to return the revenues to the community pool:\n- Until 420,690,000.00 $HUAHUA is returned to the community pool:\n    - 75% of revenues will be sent to the community pool.\n    - 24% will be burned. If the revenues are in another native denomination, a buy-back of $HUAHUA will be executed to burn the $HUAHUA.\n    - 1% used for a recurring lottery among all wallets that have spent a given amount on the marketplace. For example, each wallet that has 100k $HUAHUA (value is taken as an example) volume on the NFT marketplace for a given amount of time gets a free lottery ticket. \n\n- After the 420,690,000.00 $HUAHUA has been sent back to the community pool:\n  - 50% will be used for maintenance and future developments of the platform \n  - 25% will be sent to the community pool\n  - 17.1% will be sent to Racoon Supply DAOs\n  - 6.9% will be burned. If the revenues are in another native denomination, a buy-back of $HUAHUA will be executed to burn the $HUAHUA.\n  - 1% for the recurring lottery (as explained above)\n\n# Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we hope our proposal makes sense for everyone and that you understand the value an NFT marketplace brings to the Chihuahua Chain and the $HUAHUA communities. We welcome any feedback and comments to improve our proposal and align it with what the $HUAHUA community thinks would generate the most value.",0.02814316177426668],["Upgrade v4.2.0\n\n### Upgrade to v4.2.0\n\nThis governance proposal is for an on-chain upgrade to Chihuahua **v4.2.0**.\n\nThis upgrade includes version bumps:\n- cosmos-sdk v0.45.12\n- ibc-go v4.2.0\n- wasmd v0.30.0\nIt also introduces support for Ledge Nano S+.\nThanks to Jacob Gadikian for helping write this upgrade.\n- At block **6039999** (EST.

A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders’ time having to review the proposal).\n\nIn the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.\n\nWe instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If >33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors.

This number was originally proposed in the Cosmos whitepaper section titled [Limitations on the Number of Validators](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#limitations-on-the-number-of-validators 4). This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet.  \n\nHowever, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of <7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set.  \n\nIn the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases.

Stakeholders may be disadvantaged by informational or resource-based asymmetries, while other entities may exploit these same asymmetries to capture value controlled by the Cosmos Hub’s governance mechanisms.\n\nWe’re concerned that without establishing community standards, processes, and driving decentralized delegator-based participation, the Cosmos Hub governance mechanism could be co-opted by a centralized power. As governance functionality develops, potential participants will need to understand how to assess proposals by knowing what to pay attention to.\n\n_Solution_\nWe’re forming a focused, diverse group that’s capable of assessing and synthesizing the key parts of a proposal so that the voting community can get a fair summary of what they need to know before voting.\n\nOur solution is to initiate a Cosmos governance working group that develops decentralized community governance efforts alongside the Hub’s development. We will develop and document governance features and practices, and then communicate these to the broader Cosmos community.\n\n_Future_\nAt the end of Q1, we’ll publish recommendations for the future of the Cosmos GWG, and ideally we’ll be prepared to submit a proposal based upon those recommendations for Q2 2020.

Adding ability to upgrade contracts along with migrations (also allowing orderly shutdowns). This controlled by a governance vote.\n3.

For example, a single address could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No. Clients may opt into supporting this feature, as the existing UX of voting for a single option is preserved.\n\nThis is beneficial because oftentimes the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company or organization that owns an address might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power.\n\nAnother example use case is exchanges and custodians. Many custodians and exchanges custody multiple customers’ ATOMs in the same address and use this address to stake on behalf of them. However, because of this, it makes it infeasible to do 'passthrough voting' and give their customers voting rights over their tokens, if different customers have different voting preferences. With this new proposal, custodians can use split votes to accurately reflect the preferences of their customers in on-chain governance.\n\nThe technical architecture for this feature can be seen in ADR 037 to the Cosmos SDK: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-037-gov-split-vote.md \n\nAcceptance of this governance proposal is signalling approval to adopt this feature in a future upgrade of the Cosmos Hub.",0.005981455150820603],["Funding for Development of Governance Split Votes\n\nSikka is requesting 1776 ATOMs from the community pool to architect and implement the Governance Split Votes feature proposed in Cosmos Hub Proposal #31.

And then, all validators and node operators have to substitute the existing state machine binary to the new binary with the Gravity DEX feature. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\n\n### Potential Risk Factors\n\nAlthough Tendermint executed very extensive testing and simulation, and conducted in-depth audits, and followed up with the corresponding codebase improvement, there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new Gravity DEX feature. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately, and use the fixed state machine program provided by Tendermint.",0.04061917784516985],["Increase MaxValidators value\n\nMaxValidators=125 to MaxValidators=150 / This proposal will increase the number of active validator to 150 in the Cosmos Hub. The last update was done in 2019, and it was already mentioned that the network could easily assume 180 active seats. With the many progress done on the Cosmos ecosystem, we proprose to add 25 seats on the main chain. A lot of new validators are building on the ecosystem but not Cosmos hub directly as they cannot afford to join the main Cosmos chain to have an active seat. We believe at StakeLab that every builder on the cosmos network should be able to provide an active validating service. You can look at details on forum Governance discussions and share your opinion: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-increase-max-validator-set-size-to-150/4958",0.0010447147647654569],["⚛️  Add IBC Router to Hub ⚛️\n\nThe Hub has long been envisioned as a central point in the IBC architecture. In the battle to build and ship IBC this central vision has remained unchanged, but with so much focus on the need to build out other zones with real economies to support this network (the CosmosSDK is the result of this effort), the idea of the hub as an Interchain Router hasn't been discussed in a serious context for quite a while.\n\nThis is understandable: Cosmos needed so many other pieces to come together before the Hub had a chance to even start performing this function. Those other zones have been created, they each have products and economies. The bootstrapping era of IBC is well underway.\n\nThese new zones joining are noticing a problem: they need to maintain a large amount of infrastructure (archive nodes and relayers for each counterparty chain) to connect with all the chains in the ecosystem, a number that is continuing to increase quickly.\n\nLuckly this problem has been anticipated and IBC architected to accomodate multi-hop transactions. However, a packet forwarding/routing feature was not in the initial IBC release. This proposal aims to fix this for the Hub.\n\nThis is a proposal to include a new feature to IBC on the Hub that allows for multi-hop packet routing for ICS20 transfers. By appending an intermediate address, and the port/channel identifiers for the final destination, clients will be able to outline more than one transfer at a time.\n\nStrangelove Ventures has delivered an [IBC Middleware module](https: //github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/373) that will allow the hub to play the role of IBC Router that was always envisioned for it. Passing of this propsal will begin the era of the Hub offering interchain services to other chains and profiting from those relationships.\n\nTo pay the hub validators and stakers, this proposal implements a governance configurable fee (which we propose should be initially set to 0.0 to encourage adoption) that will be taken out of each packet and given to the community pool. The community pool will then periodically trade these fees for ATOM and distribute them to staked holders. The exact distribution method of these fees is left TBD in this proposal as it is not initially required and can be implemented in a future governance proposal. One way to do this would be using the [Groups module](https: //docs.cosmos.network/master/architecture/adr-042-group-module.html), Community spend proposals and the Gravity DEX.\n\nA vote YES on this proposal indicates that this feature should be included in the next hub upgrade. We (as the Hub) believe that time is critical right now and we cannot wait to begin providing this service to other chains. A NO vote indicates that this shouldn't be included in the next upgrade.\n\n[Full Proposal text and additional links available here](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/governance/blob/master/proposals/2021-09-hub-ibc-router/README.md",0.0004274397933431799],["Signal Proposal: Adopting the Budget and Farming Modules on Cosmos Hub\n\nThis signal proposal is to ask Atom stakers about adopting Budget and Farming modules on Cosmos Hub for general utility incentivization mechanism in near future.

By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.\n\n### Background\n\nSince the last upgrade at height 6910000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint. The following updates are included in gaia v6.0.0:\n * Bump [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.44.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) which notably includes fixes for the vesting accounts and two new modules outlined below. For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21)\n     * Add the [authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. `x/authz` is an implementation of a Cosmos SDK module, per [ADR 30](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.3/docs/architecture/adr-030-authz-module.md), that allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). Authorizations must be granted for a particular Msg service method one by one using an implementation of the `Authorization` interface.\n     * Add the [feegrant](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/feegrant/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. This module allows accounts to grant fee allowances and to use fees from their accounts. Grantees can execute any transaction without the need to maintain sufficient fees.\n     * **NOTICE** It's imortant to highlight [PR #10041](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/10041) which impacts **WALLETS AND EXCHANGES**. This update has removed the deprecated the legacy REST endpoints for broadcast & encode. **This means `POST /tx` and `POST /txs/encode` no longer work**. Please see the [REST Endpoints Migration guide](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/migrations/rest.html) to migrate to the new REST endpoints.\n * Add [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) as a standalone module from the Cosmos SDK using version [v2.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). See the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md) for details.\n     * Please note that the governance parameter for `MaxExpectedBlockDelay` is set to 30 seconds. This means if a connection is opened with a packet delay of 1 minute, it requires 2 blocks to be committed after the consensus state is submitted before the packet can be processed.\n * Add [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) [v1.0.1](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v1.0.1) as per [Proposal #56](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/56) prepared and tested by [Strangelove Ventures](https://www.strangelove.ventures/). This feature allows multi-hop IBC transfer messages so that a user can send tokens from chain A to chain C via chain B.\n * Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity) module to [v1.4.2](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.4.2) to ensure compatibility with Cosmos-SDK.\n\n### Ready for Production\n\nThese changes have been extensively tested by various Cosmos Core Contributor teams including [Hypha Co-Op](https://hypha.coop/), [Informal Systems Co-Op](https://informal.systems/), [Interchain GmbH](https://interchain.berlin/), [Regen Network](https://regen.network/), [Strangelove Ventures](https://strangelove.ventures/), [Tendermint Inc](https://tendermint.com/) and more. The release candidate for this update was run as a local testnet and a public testnet with a successful upgrade; documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test).\n\n### On-Chain Upgrade Process\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor) to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Instructions specific to the upgrade can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/gaia-tutorials/upgrade-node.md). To test a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test/blob/master/local-testnet/README.md).

These summaries will be written objectively, not siding with any one entity.\n* **Validator platforms:** Create a section of the Forum where we collate all validators' visions for Cosmos Hub governance to allow them to state their positions publicly. We will work with the smaller validators to ensure they are equally represented.\n* **Regular check-ins with the Cosmonaut DAO:** Collaborate with the future Cosmonaut DAO to ensure maximal accessibility and engagement. Community management is a critical, complementary aspect of increasing participation in governance.\n* **Announcement channel:** Create a read-only announcement channel in the Cosmos Community Discord, so that new proposals and major discussions can be easily followed.\n* **Tooling friendly posts:** Tag and categorize posts so that they can be easily ingested into existing tooling that validators have setup.\n* **Neutral moderation framework:** Document and follow transparent standards for how the forum is moderated.\n\nAt the end of the period, we will produce a report reflecting on our successes and failures, and recommendations for how the work of maintaining a governance venue can be continuously sustained (e.g., through a DAO).

We examine the technical context and existing discussion on ‘NoWithVeto’, and the range of ways the community understands NoWithVeto. We bridge these ideas into a coherent and thorough definition proposed below.\n\nIf passed, changes will be made to the Cosmos Hub documentation and Cosmos Hub Forum templates to reflect the newly accepted definition.\n\n# Proposed Definition for NoWithVeto\n\n***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***\n\nNote: In this definition we use the term “rules of engagement” to refer to practices adopted by the Cosmos Hub community through governance. These may include decision-making processes and social protocols that have passed governance and thus been accepted as rules.\n\nThe following is factually correct about how ‘NoWithVeto’ currently operates and will continue to operate regardless of this proposal’s outcome: If quorum is met and greater than 1/3 of participating voting power have voted ‘NoWithVeto’, the proposal fails and is considered to be vetoed. In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.\n\n# Discussion\n## Summary of existing definitions\nThis list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.\n\n1. **As a stronger No:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.\n2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.\n3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.\n4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).\n5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.\n6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.\n\n## Censorship\nIt may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3% of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2% of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.\n\n## Financial and social cost\n‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2% of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.\n\nConsequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. \n\nWhile there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.\n\n# Conclusion\nWe are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.\n\nCosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.\n\n# Voting options\nWe propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:\n\n***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***\n\nYour vote on this proposal indicates the following:\n* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.\n* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.

This has been reflected in the engineering efforts by various core entities including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems as well as initial users Quicksilver and Neutron. ICS allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain.\nICS is a complex technology that needs to be rigorously tested. To ensure successful rollout, we are launching an incentivized public testnet where Cosmos Hub validators can participate and build confidence around this technology. Game of Chains will build on the Cosmos Hub’s legacy of running successful adversarial testnet programs in the past including [Game of Zones](https://github.com/cosmosdevs/GameOfZones) and [Game of Stakes](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/).\nWe believe the community will see ICS as a valuable addition to Cosmos Hub for three core reasons. First, it allows for “hub minimalism.” By deploying features on a consumer chain instead of Cosmos Hub, we keep the hub lightweight and reduce the surface area for attacks and vulnerabilities. Second, Interchain Security lowers the barrier for ATOM aligned app chains to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Instead of arranging their own validator set, new app chains can utilize the Cosmos Hub’s existing validator for security. And lastly, Interchain Security accrues value to ATOM and enhances its utility. As new Interchain Secured zones launch, gas fees on these new chains flow back to ATOM stakers through the Hub’s validators.\n## Incentivized Testnet\nFor a successful launch, validators will need to prepare and train for expanding their node operations and governance efforts for every new Interchain Secured chain starting up. We are proposing an incentivized public testnet program that will serve the dual purposes of (1) testing Interchain Security in mainnet-like conditions and (2) providing Cosmos Hub validators the opportunity to build confidence around running the Interchain Security protocol.\nIn order to prevent delays and adequately prepare for launch, we believe it is critical for all Cosmos Hub validators to participate in this public testnet. For this reason, we’re seeking community approval for 20K ATOM (approximately USD 300k) withdrawn for the community pool to reward validators participating in the Cosmos Hub testnet.\n* From this prize pool, 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for Cosmos Hub validators who complete Interchain Security testnet milestones. These milestones will be published at the launch of the testnet.\n* The remaining 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for bonuses to validators who help identify bugs or performance issues or help develop new tools and monitoring solutions at the discretion of the jury\n* Funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig committee\n* Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool\n## Multisig committee\n* Zaki Manian\n* Jelena Djuric\n* Udit Vira\n## Testnet Jury\n* Billy Rennekamp\n* Zaki Manian\n* Jelena Djuric\n* Jehan Tremback\n* Udit Vira\n## Recipient\ncosmos1gn8c65j9f443zllsahm6ewmkq8xqmp43vr7un4\n## Amount\n20K ATOMs\n## Forum post link\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-77-draft-fund-incentives-for-the-interchain-security-incentivized-testnet-game-of-chains-from-the-community-pool/\n## IPFS link\nQmXwuJujfvKrqGByfhC9W8XYtpcUW8FXiA5eXR4NuYnD8J\n## Governance votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n**YES** - You approve this community spend proposal to fund the interchain security testnet incentives that will be managed by a multisig\n**NO** - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form (please indicate why in the Cosmos Forum).\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.\n\nFinally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.\n\n### Governance\n\nMembers define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.\n\nSee our website for more information about Adan's governance and [Board of Directors 3](https://adan.eu/en/association/governance).\n\nAdan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).\n\n### Works & Publications\n\nAdan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.\n\nAdan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.\n\nIn just two short years, Adan has produced an astounding amount of writing and [publications](https://adan.eu/en/publications) to support its mission:\n\n- [A crypto-euro issued by an American giant, or how Europe is delegating its monetary sovereignty](https://adan.eu/en/tribune-les-echos-crypto-euro-en)\n- [EU framework for crypto-asset markets: the French Presidency ends with political deals on MiCA and TFR](https://adan.eu/en/press-release-policy-agreements-mica)\n- [Adan's Response to IOSCO's Retail Market Conduct Report](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/en/response-report-iosco-retail-market)\n- [Adoption of TFR in the European Parliament: the fight against financial crime should not be a fight against crypto-assets](https://adan.eu/en/press/tfr-travel-rule-vote-european-parliament-europeen-econ-libe)\n- [MiCA vote in the European Parliament: A step forward or backward for the crypto sector?](https://adan.eu/en/press-release/european-parliament-mica-compromise-crypto)\n- [Adan responds to the EBA consultation on its draft guidelines for remote onboarding customer solutions 1](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/response-guidelines-eba-onboarding-solutions)\n- [Ban of Proof-of-Work protocols: wrong answer to real global environmental challenges](https://adan.eu/en/position/pow-bitcoin-ban-eu-inappropriate-answer)\n- [Adan's position on FATF's updated guidance for a risk-based approach 1](https://adan.eu/en/position/fatf-updated-guidance-vasp)\n\n## Proposal details\n\nThe crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.\n\nTo this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:\n\n- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.\n- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.\n- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.\n- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).\n\nTo overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:\n\n- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda\n- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups\n- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)\n- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests\n\nGiven the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWe believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.\n\nThis report will be delivered to you via this forum. It will consist of different sections, such as :\n\n- actions carried out in the last months;\n- missions to be carried out in the coming months;\n- distribution of the remaining allocation.\n\n## Funding Amount\n\nTotal amount requested: 8,000 ATOM\n\nThis corresponds to roughly 100,000 EUR and covers gross salary, recruitment costs, and travel expenses for half a year.\n\n## Receipient\n\ncosmos1kdff80vxuj0zmmjauymzjs40hsfkuya79s8tm0\n\n## IPFS\n\nQmR1q2i48EJqaZSXxgggE8VaPKsZFtozVBPHKejMpJAYXx\n\n## Governance Discussion\n\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-adan-non-profit-fighting-for-sound-crypto-regulation/7416\n\n## Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n- YES - You agree that persuading regulators to adopt sound and proportional regulation is important and thus wish to fund Adan's work\n- NO - You don't agree that persuading regulators is important and thus do not agree to fund Adan's work\n- NO WITH VETO - A 'NoWithVeto' vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

The proposed solution was to have a direct mint of tokens to a treasury pool.\n\nHowever, the Hub already has a Community Pool that has been used in the past for various community spend proposals. This pool is funded through taxation on a per-block basis. The current tax rate is 2%. By increasing this we can achieve a similar outcome of expanding the pool of funds available for public good funding, without the immediate creation of a new entity or the bulk minting of ATOM.\n\nThis proposal aims to increase inflows to the Community Pool to make it more in line with what we see around the ecosystem and to ensure that funding for future endeavours are secured. This is merely just a first step and more improvements will come later.\n\n## Community Pools comparison\n\nAs a chain, the Cosmos Hub has a fairly small community pool compared to its market capitalisation:\n\nCosmos Hub - 1.24M ATOMs ~ $13M / Market Cap $3.1BN\n\nOsmosis - 52.13M OSMO ~ $60.4M / Market Cap $560M\n\nJuno - 15.73M JUNO ~ $37.3M / Market Cap $150M\n\nStargaze - 445M STARS ~ $20.5M / Market Cap $60M\n\nLooking at other projects across the Cosmos Ecosystem, the Hub has a small community pool compared to its market cap at just 0.41%.\n\nLooking at other ecosystems similar to that of Cosmos, we can find Polkadot (DOT). Polkadot has a market cap of $6.7BN dollars with a treasury pool of roughly 38M DOT which equates to $230M. This figure equates to 3.4% of its total market cap. This large pool of funds is used to fund the growth of the ecosystem through grants, development funding and also community building.\n\nOn the Cosmos Hub these sorts of proposals are hard to come by due to the limited amount of funds of its community pool, and also social cost required to engage with the community. The ATOM 2.0 proposal suggested that a Treasury be created and be bootstrapped with 4M tokens at with every approved vote up to a maximum of 10 tranches. Ultimately the idea of initially minting 4M to the community pool came into the limelight. However, various community members were still uneasy about minting such an amount due to dilution effects.\n\nThe system as it is currently has its flaws but also works. Until consensus on that solution is found regarding the future of inflation and if / when ATOM becomes deflationary, we, **Simply Staking**, are proposing increasing the community pool tax from the current 2% to 10% as that will help bootstrap the community pool organically without too much compromise to inflationary yield.\n\n## Community Pool Tax\n\nCurrent rate of Issuance: 9.6ATOM per block according to x/mint\n\nCurrent amount of blocks per year: 4,360,000\n\nInstead of the current 0.192ATOM being transferred per block to the pool with the 2% tax, with a tax rate set at 10% we would see around 11,460 ATOM per day (0.96 ATOM per block) get moved to the community pool. Over a year this would allocate around ~4.2M ATOM to the community pool.\n\n## How will this increase affect staking rewards?\n\nWith every block, staking rewards are minted. A percentage of those rewards are diverted to the community pool and then the rest to the stakers.

While news is shared on several platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Telegram, Blogs and others, the information is very spread and usually challenging for stakeholders to find it and avoid missing some important updates. Some projects exist trying to gather and put together the main news, however these are mostly news headlines without in-depth assessments or educational content.\n\nKeeping Cosmos stakeholders aligned and informed about important developments in areas such as governance, new technical features, project launches and upgrades or conferences is important and helps to have more constructive discussions.\n\nOur goal with the Cosmos ecosystem news videos is to both educate and keep the broad Cosmos ecosystem community and stakeholders well informed, as well as helping to onboard new users to the ecosystem and increase the awareness about the advantages of building with Cosmos tech.\n\n## **Deliverables**\n\nThere will be two monthly Cosmos ecosystem news videos produced, so for the initial 6 months period a total of 12 videos will be delivered.\n\n## **Funding amount**\n\nTotal amount requested: 300 ATOM monthly for an initial period of 6 months, with a renewal if all deliverables are completed.\n\nThis corresponds to roughly 3,000 USD monthly and covers the production costs for two monthly Cosmos ecosystem news videos, including research and content preparation, filming and the required equipment, video design and additional operational costs.\n\n## **Recipient**\n\ncosmos1de7qx00pz2j6gn9k88ntxxylelkazfk3dnaamk\n\n## **IPFS**\n\nQmQvQoXbqvy1tmGuTyd2Zpe4jkGDjRnSy7G8rr5X6HaQni\n\n## **Governance discussion**\n\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-cosmos-ecosystem-news-videos/8357\n\n## **Governance votes**\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\nYES - You agree that educating and keeping all Cosmos ecosystem stakeholders informed and updated is important and thus wish to fund Cosmic Validator's work\n\nNO - You don't agree that educating and keeping all Cosmos ecosystem stakeholders informed and updated is important and thus do not agree to fund Cosmic Validator's work\n\nNO WITH VETO - A 'NoWithVeto' vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

This event is expected to happen in Q1 2023.\n\nThis is a community pool spend proposal seeking approval to fund **20000 ATOMs** worth of incentives for the Game of NFTs **Phase 1 - Interchain NFTs incentivized testnets** - to reward participants.\n\n# Background - Interchain NFTs \n\nThe Interchain NFTs technology can facilitate interoperability and expands the capabilities of IBC by allowing cross-chain NFT interoperability between IBC-enabled chains, which is the work of multi-team efforts supported by the Interchain Foundation. \n\nWith collaborative efforts from ICF, IRISnet, Gravity Bridge, Stargaze, Ark Protocol and many community teams, it has Cosmos SDK and CosmWasm implementations that can be easily adopted by Cosmos SDK Chains including Cosmos Hub or CosmWasm Chains to expand their interconnections across the ecosystem. \n\nIn November 2022, the first IBC NFT transfer between two test chains using different implementations of ICS721 was successfully executed on testnets. This marked a significant step forward for the IBC NFT ecosystem demonstrating the NFT interoperability between Cosmos SDK (Go) and CosmWasm (Rust) chains. \n\nNFTs have now captured the attention of various industries as well as Cosmos stakeholders. Similar to fungible tokens, if NFTs are just tied to one blockchain, the number of transactions and size of the NFT market would be restricted. To remedy this and unleash the next level of Cosmos NFT, high connectivity and interoperability are required. This is where Interchain NFTs enter the picture. We believe that Interchain NFTs and the community collaboration around them are expanding the mindshare and market share for Cosmos. \n\nMore details about Interchain NFTs: [Interchain NFTs are Coming to Cosmos | by Interchain | The Interchain Foundation | Medium 4](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/interchain-nfts-are-coming-to-cosmos-e01e3abe3d37) \n\n# Game of NFTs \n\nThe Interchain NFTs technology requires rigorous testing with the community involved. To boost the IBC NFT ecosystem, we’re proposing to launch a Game of NFTs event, which will build on the success of previous programs including [Game of Stakes 6](https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes) and [Game of Zones 1](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/), as well as the ongoing [Game of Chains 1](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022). The event is expected to have two phases: \n* Phase 1: Public Incentivized Testnets, for chains and service providers to test around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around February 2023. \n* Phase 2: A Hackathon, for developers to create tools, dApps and use cases around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around March 2023. \n\n## Public Incentivized Testnets - Phase 1 \n\nMany talented teams are contributing to the IBC NFT ecosystem, and have plans to deploy this Interchain NFTs technology. To facilitate wide adoption and successful deployment to capture more value to the Interchain, Phase 1 of the Game of NFTs event is designed to provide mainnet-like environments for purposes on a) testing the performance and capability of Interchain NFTs feature, and b) building trust in Interchain NFTs and preparing for its deployment in the mainnet environments. \n\nThe Interchain NFTs technology is crucial to facilitate interoperability and use cases of IBC, and will capture more value and use cases for both Cosmos-SDK and Wasm chains in Cosmos. By bringing this proposal up, we believe in the Interchain, Cosmos Hub is always a pioneer that takes the lead to pays attention to innovative technologies and public goods that can enhance IBC, Cosmos SDK and more underlying technologies, which is crucial to Cosmos Hub, Cosmos chains and also the Interchain. We would like to bring more value to the Interchain and there is no better way to do this than by having support from Cosmos Hub to Cosmos teams and communities to join the testing and improve this technology jointly. \n\nFor this reason, we believe it’s crucial to have testnets environment for Cosmos teams and communities to participate, as well well to reward participants who help contribute through the testing to the Interchain, we’re seeking community approval for 20K ATOMs withdrawn for the community pool as incentives for the GoN Phase 1 - Public Incentivized Testnet. \n\n* 50% (10K ATOM) of the prize pool will be reserved for Phase 1 participants who complete Public Incentivized Testnet tasks with a set point system that is allocated based on their scores. These tasks and the point system will be published at the launch of the testnet. \n* The remaining 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for bonuses to Phase 1 participants who help identify bugs or performance issues or help develop new tools and monitoring solutions at the discretion of the board of judges \n* Funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig committee \n* Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool \n\nGame of NFTs is a joint effort by the Interchain ecosystem, so certainly, in addition to the support from the Cosmos community pool to advance the infrastructure and underlying technology, there will be various support from Cosmos projects such as IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno and other teams, and also from organizations such as IDG Capital and HashKey Capital. There will be multi-team support from their community pools, to sponsor the prize pool of Phase 2 Hackathon that is boosting applications on top of this infrastructure and technology. \n\nThrough collaborative efforts of the Cosmos teams and community, this whole event will bring out verified Interchain NFTs infrastructure and technology that can be simply used and adopted by Cosmos chains, and prompt the creation of various pioneer applications using the technology, which together will create a complete IBC NFT ecosystem from bottom-up for the Interchain, and quickly expand the mind and market share for Cosmos. \n\n## Board of Judges \n\n* Susannah Evans | IBC Product Lead, ICF \n* Haifeng Xi | CTO, Bianjie \n* Shane Vitarana | Co-founder, Stargaze \n* Deborah Simper | Co-founder, Gravity Bridge \n* Jeffrey Hu | Tech Lead, HashKey Capital \n\n## Multisig Committee \n\n* Haifeng Xi | CTO, Bianjie \n* Michael Scotto | Bridge Engineer, Stargaze \n* Jeffrey Hu | Tech Lead, HashKey Capital \n\n## Recipient \n\ncosmos152dcrzkyhqg48tng79x2jr8za4yg452kneuvwa \n\n## Amount \n\n20000 ATOMs \n\n## Forum post link \n\n[https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-fund-incentives-for-the-interchain-nfts-public-incentivized-testnets-of-game-of-nfts/8638/1](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-fund-incentives-for-the-interchain-nfts-public-incentivized-testnets-of-game-of-nfts/8638/1) \n\n## Voting \n\n* By voting YES on this proposal, you indicate support for funding the Interchain NFTs public testnets incentives that will be managed by a multisig committee \n* By voting NO on this proposal, you do not support this proposal in its current form - please kindly indicate why by leaving comments in the Cosmos Forum. \n* By voting ABSTAIN, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal but want to contribute to the quorum. \n* By voting NOWITHVETO, you express that you consider this proposal malicious or harmful and you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of the deposit, which contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",0.03678093080903263],["A Grant Program for the Cosmos Hub: Funding the ATOM Accelerator DAO\n\n\n\n<B>Summary</B> \n\nWith a properly funded community pool (following prop 88), we believe it is the right time to launch one or more grant programs to serve community contributors and builders around the Hub. \nThis is a community spending proposal seeking approval to fund 588,000 ATOMs for the ATOM Accelerator DAO Grant Program.\n\n<I>Note:</I> The program was formerly referenced as Cosmos Hub Grant Program (CHGP) and Orbital DAO.\n\n<B>Grant Program Overview</B> \n\nWith the ATOM Accelerator DAO, we seek to boost community participation and unlock its collective intelligence by encouraging individual and team-based initiatives. \nThe ATOM Accelerator DAO offers an alternative, native source of funding for the Cosmos Hub and removes some of the burden on public governance. \nThis program has more funding flexibility and also allows proactive allocation of capital through the development of in-house investment themes in collaboration with the community.\n\nGrants will focus on open source code, public goods, and ecosystem initiatives that create value for ATOM holders.\n\nThe existing Hub issues that can be solved through this program are:\n - Insufficient funding of public goods;\n - Idle capital in the community pool;\n - Growth risk aversion;\n - Low support of teams already growing the Hub; and\n - Losing developers to other L1s.\n\nThe grant program solves these problems through:\n - Liaising between decentralized teams;\n - Minimizing risk through due diligence;\n - Supporting teams already growing the Hub;\n - Bringing new developers to the Hub and;\n - Efficiently deploying capital to ensure R&D & growth at the Hub.\n\n<B>The Team</B> \n\n<B>A.

See the full [Changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v3.4.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\r\n- Bump [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to `v0.45.12` from `v0.45.9`. See the full [Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.12) and [Commit History](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/compare/v0.45.9...v0.45.12) for details and updates between the last version of the SDK used in Theta. \r\n- Bump [Tendermint](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to `v0.34.24` and replace with the [Informal Systems fork](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to ensure software continuity.\r\n- Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity) to `v1.5.3` which notably includes updating Go to `1.18` and the Cosmos-SDK to `v45.11` to ensure compatiblity with the Cosmos Hub.\r\n- Bump [Packet Forward Middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) to `v3.1.1`  from `v2.1.1`. Users should note that PFM was not configure properly in the previous version of Gaia. This module update includes necessary bug fixes to make it functional on the Cosmos Hub in v8.\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n- Add the [Global Fee](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/main/x/globalfee) module to the Cosmos Hub, which enables setting transaction fees at the network level via `param-change` governance proposal. For more information, see the [module documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/modules/globalfee.md).\r\n- Add the `debug bech32-convert` [command](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/1845), enabling users to convert any bech32 string to the cosmos prefix. \r\n\r\n**Fixes**\r\n- Fix Bank Denom Metadata [issue](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/1892). In a previous upgrade, the `x/bank` metadata was incorrectly migrated, resulting in an incorrect bank metadata. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L19) for more information. \r\n- Fix Quicksilver ICA exploit detailed in the [forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/upcoming-interchain-accounts-bugfix-release/8911) on the incident. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L58) for more information.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n- Add a [suite of E2E tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/release/v8.0.x/tests/e2e) to ensure core features of the Cosmos Hub work as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Testnet\r\nV8 Rho went live on the persistent testnet after the successful simulated upgrade. For more information, see the testnet [upgrade proposal](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/proposals/112) or [block explorer](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/), and visit the [persistent testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public).\r\n\r\n#### On-Chain Upgrade Process\r\n\r\nThis upgrade can be performed in multiple ways. When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically *before* swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\r\n\r\n#### Potential Risk Factors\r\n\r\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v7.1.0).",0.0009014765784803869],["Censure allnodes for insecure VaaS practices\n\n## Description\n\nFor context, please reference this report, produced by the Notional labs team with assistance from numerous community members:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1AIOOrHiNAFQKwzaeDNyJJJx8SwXNlaSUcZbasnezXS4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTo discuss, and to see a screenshot from today, of allnodes offering insecure VaaS services, please use this tweet:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gadikian/status/1622566060942819328?s=20\n\nTo discuss in the cosmos hub forum, please use this discussion:\n\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/censure-allnodes-for-insecure-vaas-practices/9519\n\n## Summary\nAllnodes is a validator on the cosmos hub, and offers insecure custodial VaaS on the Cosmos Hub, which is harmful to the economic and security interests of the cosmos community at large.

It creates a great moral dilemma as to who will receive and how much support, or whether to give support to anyone who asks for it. In order to prevent this, it is of great importance for the good of the whole cosmos that the next charity proposals must be run through a Charity DAO. That's why we're asking for both your support and the establishment of a Charity DAO. And again, the reason why we did not establish this proposal through the Charity DAO is that every passing second is costing a human life.\n\nThe funds will be transferred to the Ihtiyac haritası (https://www.ihtiyacharitasi.org/ , https://www.needsmap.coop/ ), which is one of Turkey's most reliable non-governmental organizations, which still continues its search and rescue activities in the earthquake zone. The Cosmos Account of the Ihtiyaç haritası has been approved by the T.C. Financial Crimes Investigation Agency “MASAK”. Since the account has been opened on the local crypto exchange (Paribu), funds will be transferred to the organization's Paribu account via multisig. In order not to harm the Cosmos ecosystem, the funds received will be converted into Turkish lira by Paribu (the crypto exchange in Turkey used by Ahbap and Ihtiyaç haritası for the funds) without being sold on the market, and Paribu will use these funds as liquidity.\n\nFund Request:\n\nWe are asking for 20.000 Atom from Cosmos Hub\n\n\nMulti-sig:\n\nDilan Asatekin [Founder-Imperator.co,Osmosisi Labs],\nZafercan Çakır [Founder-Stake-Relax Validatör],\nMert Fırat [İhtiyaç Haritası and Ahbap organization],\nNova Ratio and 0xwilds\n\n\n-By voting YES on this proposal, you agree that Cosmos hub should help earthquake victims.\n-By voting NO on this proposal, you reject that Cosmos hub should help earthquake victims.\n-By voting NO WITH VETO, you reject that Cosmos hub should help earthquake victims, and additionally intend to contribute towards proposal rejection and burning of proposal deposit if NoWithVeto votes are greater than a third of voting power.\n-By voting ABSTAIN, you decline to give an opinion on the proposition.\n\n",0.24037683930194106],["Confio Public Goods Funding - Tranche One\n\n## Summary\nThis is a community spend proposal.

The best known are the CosmJS & CosmWasm libraries, two key components of the Cosmos software stack, but you can review the [list of dozens of repositories](https://github.com/confio/funding/blob/main/Repositories.md) Confio maintains. These libraries are highly valued by developers and chains across the Cosmos ecosystem. In addition, they focus on expanding IBC protocols by developing IBC-enabled contracts and training others how to do so as well.\n\nConfio is also prepared to offer some services and support for the success of Cosmos Hub secured consumer chains in exchange for such funding support. This will be defined more below, but it should be clear that there are also tangible benefits for the Cosmos Hub through this proposal. ## Use of Funds\nConfio currently has a burn rate of circa 230k USD/month with around 90% of outgoing payments going to salaries. All funds from this proposal will go to pay salaries of employees. Principally developers, but also marketing/community building work (for the conference) and internal support (HR / accounting) needed to keep the company running.\n\nOur headcount has been reducing and as of the end of February 2023, we will have 20 employees, including 10 developers and 1 product owner (one more if Ethan gets to code again and stop fundraising).

In return for this payment, Notional will monitor the Cosmos Hub for potential vulnerabilities on a 365/24/7 basis. When we become aware of an ongoing vulnerability, we will coordinate with relevant teams (SDK, IBC, Comet/Tendermint, Cosmos Hub), and work to produce a patch. We will then assist in rolling these patches out to validators to resolve the incident as soon as possible.\n\nWe will also advise core teams if we notice issues in upcoming releases which could cause safety or liveness problems, and assist them to resolve the issues.\n\nWe will write a monthly report on our activities so that the community has insight into them and can keep us accountable.

Bro_n_Bro have expertise in working with indexers in the ecosystem and comprehending their utilization in building advanced applications. Despite the popularity of existing indexers for monitoring purposes, they lack the necessary flexibility and user experience for developers and users. As more blockchains emerge, the need for more data storage becomes imperative. Although improving storage and data access at the SDK level would be ideal, for now, a separate indexer remains the best solution for quick access to data.\n\nTo address this requirement, we propose developing a comprehensive set of open-source tools for data indexation and storage, utilizing the cutting-edge technology of ClickHouse as the foundation for the storage facility. This approach will provide quick access to large data sets and ensure a stable architecture that guarantees data consistency and enables a lightweight setup. This will foster the creation of more sophisticated user experience and analytics applications within the Cosmos Hub and across the entire Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\n- Utilizing ClickHouse as the storage facility to provide quick access to large data sets\n- Developing a stable architecture that guarantees data consistency\n- An easily deployable setup that will enable the development of more user-experience and analytics applications in the Cosmos Hub and the entire Cosmos ecosystem\n- Providing dev documentation, contribution, and setup guides to assist in the understanding and execution of the project\n\n## Description\n\nWe formed the proposed architecture for the mean of scalability and data consistency.\n\nTo achieve named purposes process of crawling and writing to DB are separated into different microservices:\n\n- [crawler](https://github.com/bro-n-bro/spacebox-crawler)\n- [writer](https://github.com/bro-n-bro/spacebox-writer)\n\nAll services are packed into the docker to simplify deployment. The main [repo](https://github.com/bro-n-bro/spacebox) contains a ready-to-use docker-compose file and deployment documentation.\n\nAll the services mentioned above are in the pre-Alpha version and should not be considered a final product.\n\n## Funding\n\nAmount: 7500 ATOM\n\nRecipient: cosmos106yp7zw35wftheyyv9f9pe69t8rteumjxjql7m\n\nDevelopment has been started already, but to finalize it, we are requesting the support of the Cosmos Hub community. 7500 ATOMs would be enough to cover the costs of development and implementation of the Indexer that supports current [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.45.13/x) and IBC modules\n\nThe proposed project will take:\n\n**soft date** - 3 months\n\n**hard date** - 6 months\n\n## Conclusion\n\nToday most cosmos applications are built either on raw chain data directly from API or based on closed-source indexators. Having open-sourced robust solution with easy and fast data access may drive great new applications development and improve whole ecosystem growth.\n\n## Whoami\n\nBro_n_Bro has been presented in the Cosmos ecosystem for almost two years as an independent community-driven validator in 12 chains.

The feature being discussed here is in this family, but more accurately termed “Replicated Security”. In the past it has been referred to as Interchain Security v1, or ICS, but going forward we refer to it as Replicated Security.*\n\n## Summary\nThis on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt . By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.  \n\nThe Cosmos Hub is upgrading its security system with a new feature called Replicated Security. This will allow the Cosmos Hub to provide its strong security to other blockchains, which are called 'consumer chains'. The cost to censor or control a consumer chain with an economic attack is the same as the cost to censor or control the Cosmos Hub itself. This means that consumer chains can benefit from the Cosmos Hub's security without having to maintain their own validator sets.  \n\nReplicated Security works through the IBC protocol. Consumer chains receive periodic IBC packets containing the up-to-date validator set of the Cosmos Hub and use this to update their own validator sets, effectively replicating the Hub's validator set. This means that the Cosmos Hub's validators can validate multiple chains at once with the same stake.  \n\nIn exchange for this service, consumer chains are expected to send a portion of their fees and inflation to the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators. These tokens will then be included as part of the Cosmos Hub's staking rewards.\n\n## Software details\n### Updates\n* (feat) Add [Interchain-Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v1.0.0) provider module. See the [ICS Spec](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation/README.md) for more details.\n* (gaia) Bump [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.13-ics](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics) for details.\n* (gaia) Bump [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to [v4.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v4.2.x/CHANGELOG.md). See [v4.2 Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for details.\n* (gaia) Bump [tendermint](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to [0.34.26](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/tree/v0.34.26). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/blob/v0.34.26/CHANGELOG.md#v03426) for details.\n* (gaia) Bump [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) to [v4.0.4](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v4.0.4).\n* (tests) Add [E2E ccv tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/tests/e2e/e2e_gov_test.go#L138). Tests covering new functionality introduced by the provider module to add and remove a consumer chain via governance proposal.\n* (tests) Add [integration ccv tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/tests/ics/interchain_security_test.go). Imports Interchain-Security's  and implements Gaia as the provider chain.\n\n### On-Chain Upgrade Process\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary.  \n\nAlternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local).\n\n### Potential Risk Factors\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.  \n\nCosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the #validators-verified channel of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v8.0.1).\n\n## Governance votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n* YES - You approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.\n* NO - You don’t approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub. Please indicate why on the Cosmos Hub forum.\n* NO WITH VETO - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n* ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\n## Appendix: Replicated Security\n### Changes to this proposal\nThis proposal went onto the governance forum in mid-December. Since that time, we have made one change to the protocol. In response to the only high-severity finding in the Informal audit report (see 'Testing and audits below'), and feedback from the community, we have made it so that the slashing and tombstoning of validators for offenses on consumer chains must be approved by a governance vote. This will have a [very minimal impact](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing) on the operation and security of consumer chains while protecting the Cosmos Hub from possibility of an attack by a rogue consumer chain.  \n\nThis governance gating is temporary until the Cosmos Hub is able to cryptographically verify proof of double signing in an upcoming release of Replicated Security. This does not give governance the ability to slash validators arbitrarily, but rather to approve slash packets that have already been transmitted from a consumer chain.\n\n### The ATOM economic zone\nIt is anticipated that consumer chains using Replicated Security will collaborate closely in an 'ATOM economic zone'. This is expected to have a snowball effect, with the Cosmos Hub securing a growing group of high-value decentralized protocols. Already, some prominent projects such as a smart-contracting platform, an AMM, several liquid staking providers and others have expressed interest in using Replicated Security from the Cosmos Hub.  \n\nReplicated Security can also be used to further the cause of “Hub minimalism”. Any new features to the Hub, even if they are core to the Hub's functionality, can be launched as consumer chains. This allows the Hub to scale better and separate release cycles, enabling faster deployment of new features.\n\n### Onboarding a consumer chain\nThis governance proposal will not launch any consumer chains on its own. Instead, it will only add the necessary code to the Cosmos Hub to enable Replicated Security. In order to launch, each consumer chain must submit their own governance proposal to be voted on separately.  \n\nIt is expected that before launch, a consumer chain will have participated in a Cosmos Hub Replicated Security testnet, conducted their own testnets, and undergone an audit by reputable auditors.  \n\nOnce a consumer chain proposal passes, Cosmos Hub validators can begin running the consumer chain and receiving rewards. The chain will only start if more than two-thirds (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators decide to run the consumer chain.\n\n### Offboarding a consumer chain\nOnce the consumer chain is running, validators can be slashed and jailed for consensus faults such as downtime and double signing on the consumer chain.  \n\nAt any point in time, one-third (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators will be able to stop running the consumer chain at once: the chain will halt, and none of them will be slashed for downtime.  \n\nThe offboardings of consumer chains will have strong social norms to protect both sides, and any kind of forceful exit will only be coordinated in extreme cases such as protocol failures or attacks.  \n\nFor normal cases, a separate governance proposal will be made to remove a consumer chain, which will allow Cosmos Hub validators to stop running it.\n\n### Further resources and information:\n#### Archival links\n* [IPFS pin of unabridged proposal text](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmY7h5BV725yifQavezbLVPM7nhG5UGpwk7pALEw8GNcU9)\n* [Forum discussion](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-v9-lambda-upgrade-with-replicated-security/8766)\n\n#### Essays and detailed feature explanations\n* [Preparing for Replicated Security](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/preparing-for-replicated-security/8925)\n* [Governance-Gated Slashing vs Automatic Equivocation Slashing](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing)\n\n#### Testing and audits\n* [Informal Systems Audit team results](https://informal.systems/replicated-security-audit.pdf)\n* [Findings from Game of Chains and Beyond](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/findings-from-game-of-chains-and-beyond/9720)\n* [ICS software tests](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/tree/main/tests)",0.0009554424977618418],["Interchain Info Funding\n\n# Overview\n\n[Original Cosmos Forum Post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-21-interchain-info-hub-funding/9822)\n[IPFS Version](https://sparkibc.s3.filebase.com/InterchainInfo/Hub%20Funding%20Prop%20for%20ICI.pdf)\n\nBuilt by Spark IBC, Interchain Info (ICI) is a truly multi-chain & chain-agnostic hub for information and tooling to make navigating the rapidly growing Interchain easier for both new and old users alike. At Spark IBC, we believe that, currently, “Cosmos” and the greater Interchain are extremely fragmented, as communities, educational resources, NFT collections, Dapps and tools each reside in their own remote corners of the ecosystem.\n\nICI aims to change this by taking the first step toward building the unified, multi-chain future that the community has been waiting for, and that we believe is paramount to Cosmos gaining mass adoption in the next market cycle. We are currently running an ICI funding campaign on the Spark IBC platform, found here, [https://sparkibc.zone](https://sparkibc.zone) 4 along with more details about ICI itself.\n\nWe are avoiding VCs and private investors in this endeavor, because ICI is only a valuable resource if it remains unbiased and beholden to no one but the community that uses it. Therefore, all ICI costs so far have come out of our own pockets, and going forwards, we're raising funds entirely through grants and donations from users and community pools.\n\n## Request\n\nWe request 1% of community pool funds, capped at $20,000 from a number of chains, including The Cosmos Hub, to contribute to The ICI Campaign on Spark IBC. For The Hub, this makes our total ask ~$20k or 1,438 ATOM at the time of writing.\n\nIf passed,\n\n- 50% of issued funds will be donated directly to ICI for general development, hosting and maintenance, to be used alongside other funding sources like private contributions done through the Spark platform.\n- The remaining 50% will be used as incentives for community members to create and submit content about general cosmos tech. For other chains, this 50% is reserved for content about stuff built in that chains ecosystem, but since the Hub is positioned a bit differently, we think it's match made in heaven to direct these funds towards content on things like IBC, CosmWasm, the Cosmos SDK, etc.\n- For The Hub, this amounts to ~20k USD in Atom total, which is about 1,438 ATOM, which will then be split 50/50 as outlined above.\n\nEach network that approves funding will be rewarded with Spark Points based on their full donation amount and a customized entry on our leaderboard labeled “[chain name] Community.” Spark Points are used within the Spark IBC system to recognize users for their contributions to the Interchain. In this case, there would be an entry made for “The Cosmos Hub Community” with 20k Spark Points.\n\nOne Spark Point is representative of one dollar (or USDC, or, in this case, token equivalent) donated, and is tracked through the soulbound $SPARK token on Juno Network. For these donations, Spark IBC will set up a wallet on Juno, or use the Bech32 converted version of the community pools address on Juno, label it accordingly on our leaderboard, and mint $SPARK equivalent to the USD value of the donated amount into it, measured by the price at the time of distribution. Slippage and fees for conversion will not be taken into account, as that's beyond the communities control.\n\nOne significant benefit of multi-chain projects is the unique ability to distribute our funding requests across different sources to minimize sell pressure and the burden on any single community pool/token. This sort of effort is something that Spark IBC plans to pioneer and offer as a potential service to any who use the Spark IBC platform for fundraising in future.\n\n\nSimilar funding requests will also be submitted to the following Cosmos chains:\n\n- Agoric\n- Akash\n- Band\n- Carbon\n- Cheqd\n- Chihuahua\n- Comdex\n- Cosmos Hub\n- Evmos\n- Fetch AI\n- Injective\n- Juno\n- Kava\n- Kujira\n- Osmosis\n- Persistence\n- Secret\n- Sommelier\n- Stargaze\n- Teritori\n- LUNC\n- Terra\n\n[Funding Ask Amounts Spreadsheet](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/e/edd7c2b885e321d82eefd114a7be03f232534462_2_629x500.png)\n\n## Spending Details\n\n### Base Contribution\n\nIn addition to the ICI info on SparkIBC.zone, we also have a rough breakdown of how funds will be spent given hitting certain funding tiers, found here 2\nLink: [ICI Budget Outline for Initial Raise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GYFnJYozptojj3ytE_OYbo03inoQ1dEJxnHnmparWQ/edit#gid=0)\n\n### Incentives Program\n\nAs stated, 50% of the requested $20k will be used exclusively to incentivize content related to general Cosmos tech & terminology on the Index and Resource hub. This allows community members and content creators the ability to earn a little income while contributing something beneficial to the entire interchain. It also ensures that a portion of the allotted funding amount returns to the community in a very direct way.\n\nNote: the Spark & ICI Team reserve the right to deny payment, both pre/post-production, to anyone on the basis of content quality or attempts to manipulate this proposed system (i.e. needlessly long articles, videos, copy others existing work as a full new submission etc.); this is not a “trustless” incentive program. At this time, we will only accept English submissions meeting basic literary standards; however, we may expand this program to include other languages in the future and/or add a translation tier to the list of incentives below (we are open to feedback on these details):\n\n[Submission outline](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/9/92c9a4e08b05afbc1cf46e0da69df8b0c827f1ee_2_450x500.png)\n\n*$0.05/word (written content) and $5.00/min. (video content) are below industry standards, but the crux of this project is to further incentivize creators who are already producing original content, while refining and updating existing material that needs to constantly be updated. In its entirety, this project will both promote new material and provide house-keeping for fresh, up-to-date information in order to attract new ecosystem investors and users.\n\n## Misc. Details\n\nHow will payment be distributed and handled?\n\n- We will be asking for the requested amount as a single lump sum payment. The amount granted will then be split into two chunks, each comprising 50% of the total.\n\t- 50% will be DCA'd out into stables over the following 15 days. Meaning a maximum daily sell pressure of no more than ~$666 per day for chains granting the full 20k, such as the Hub, and far less for others. This will be the base contribution.\n\t- The other 50% will be set aside for the content incentives program outlined above, and we will be gauging community sentiment on doing one of the three following options\n\t\t- Keep in the native currency\n\t\t- DCA out to stables along with the rest. Sell pressure will be kept to the above figure or less.\n\t\t- DCA out half (of the 50%, or 25% of the total) along with the base contribution.\n\nWill the incentives program be transparent?\n\t- Of course! We will keep records of payouts and the work done to receive them for the community to review. This also serves to provide a metric for results, and should help communities gauge whether a continuation of this program later down the road would be something of interest to them or not.\n\nHow long do you intend the incentive programs to last?\n\t- Due to the drastically different ask amounts amongst various chains, as well as the amount of content relevant to them, some chains' incentives may dry up much quicker than others. We believe that with the program we've outlined above, regardless of the duration, the general amount of work achieved per dollar spent should be similar.\n\nWhat happens if a chain does not pass the proposal, are they to be treated any differently?\n\t- Absolutely not. All chains and projects in the Cosmos are equal in our eyes, and no community will be penalized for failing to support our effort, except by missing out on the incentives program and, of course, contributing to something crucially important for the entire Interchain.\n\n\n\n## Voting Options\n\nYES: Agree to proceed with the funding for interchain info.\nNO: Disagree with the funding for interchain info.\nNO WITH VETO: Disagree with the funding for interchain info and want depositors penalized.\nABSTAIN: Decline to give an opinion on the funding.\n\n",0.1407916527348765],["Replicated Security Third Party Audit\n\n# Replicated Secuirty Third Party Audit\n\nAuthors: [Simply Staking](https://twitter.com/SimplyStaking)\n\n## Summary\n\nCommissioning [Oak Security](https://www.oaksecurity.io/) to conduct a third-party audit of the Replicated Security (Interchain Security v1) code with a similar scope as to the audit conducted by the Informal audit team.\n\n## The Proposal\n\nThis proposal aims to use community pool funds to commission a third-party audit for the Replicated Security code. This audit is to be conducted by Oak Security, one of the most-reputable auditors in the space.\n\nThe price of the audit will be $102,000 and will take roughly three weeks starting on the 29th of March 2023. The auditors will require payment upfront to start the audit process after which, contact will be kept with each other for progress updates and any questions during the audit.\n\nThe scope of the audit is to review the latest version of the Replicated Security code. The main aims are to double-check the audit by Informal Systems as well as review the code changes since that audit was completed to ensure that the latest version of the Replicated Security code is reviewed thoroughly and no new issues have come to light.\n\nSince this is a community pool spend proposal, we want to ensure the community that the funds will arrive at the designated recipient by creating a multi-sig.\n\nThe multi-sig will comprise of:\n\n-   [Jehan](https://twitter.com/JTremback) (Informal Systems)\n-   [Zaki](https://twitter.com/zmanian) (Core Cosmos Contributor)\n-   [Jacob](https://twitter.com/gadikian) (Notional)\n-   [Kai](https://twitter.com/oldremez) (Neutron)\n\nThe address of the Multi-Sig: [cosmos1j20yq6atn9nuanwgsancnv4wk4nszagk3wwudp](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/account/cosmos1j20yq6atn9nuanwgsancnv4wk4nszagk3wwudp)\n\n## Breakdown of Fees\n\nWith this proposal, we (Simply Staking) have been and will be the main point of contact with Oak Security which means that we will handle all things related to answering their questions and queries.

We call these variants collectively the “liquid staking module” (LSM). The LSM mitigates liquid staking risks by limiting the total amount of ATOM that can be liquid staked to 25% of all staked ATOM. The initial GlobalLiquidStakingCap would be set to 25% and is configurable by Cosmos Hub governance. As an additional risk-mitigation feature, the LSM introduces a requirement that validators self-bond 1 ATOM to be eligible for 250 ATOM in delegations from liquid staking providers or to be eligible to mint LSM tokens. This new mechanism is called the “validator bond,” and is technically distinct from the current self-bond mechanism, but functions similarly; the initial validator bond factor would be set at 250 and is configurable by Cosmos Hub governance. At the same time, the LSM introduces the ability for staked ATOM to be instantly liquid staked, without having to wait for the twenty-one day unbonding period. In sum, the liquid staking module equips the Cosmos Hub to thrive in a world with increasing demand for liquid staked ATOM. It proposes a safe, regulated path toward increasing capital efficiency. \n\n\n# Next steps\nThis proposal is a temperature check with the Cosmos Hub community. It is NOT executable.

However, there is a prevailing sentiment of unity surrounding the ongoing legal dispute between All in Bits, Inc., and Grace Yu. We are collectively advocating for All in Bits, Inc. to withdraw their lawsuit against Grace Yu, as it threatens not only the reputation of our network but also the values that underpin the Cosmos vision.\n\n### Context and Background:\nAll in Bits, Inc., a foundation organisation of $ATOM, has initiated a lawsuit against Grace Yu, a member of our community, on grounds that many believe to be unsubstantiated. The case was taken to a Federal court, seeking damages of $150,000. The legal costs incurred just to initiate the case substantially exceed this value. The concern is that this legal action seems motivated by vindictive intent rather than legitimate legal grievances, which has led to widespread confusion and increasing distrust.\n\n### Legal Implications and Community Impact:\nThe lawsuit against Grace Yu has the potential to instigate unwarranted scrutiny and may have legal implications for $ATOM. The impact of this legal action on the token's value, precedent,, and overall community sentiment should be carefully considered. Moreover, the community's perception of All in Bits, Inc., may suffer, which could weaken our collective trust in the Cosmos network.\n\n### Misuse of Funds and Core Values:\nWe find it particularly concerning that All in Bits, Inc., has chosen to allocate funds, initially intended for the development and promotion of open-source software, towards financing this lawsuit. This decision contradicts the principles of transparency and fairness that are fundamental to our community.\n\n### Request:\nWe disapprove of legal action against any community member from founding organisations.

When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically *before* swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found&nbsp;[here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the&nbsp;[local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\\r\n\\r\n#### Potential Risk Factors\\r\n\\r\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the&nbsp; channel&nbsp;of the&nbsp;[Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork)&nbsp;to create and execute a contingency plan.

But no actual changes have yet been implemented. In order to implement Stride’s ICS signaling proposal, two concurrent executable proposals are needed.\n\nThis is the second of two executable proposals. This proposal is to provide 450,000 ATOM from the community pool to the stATOM/ATOM liquidity pool on Astroport Neutron.\n\nThis liquidity will benefit Stride and Neutron, both members of the ATOM Economic Zone. For Stride, more stATOM liquidity further strengthens the stATOM-ATOM peg, which will enable increased stATOM collateralization. For Neutron, stATOM liquidity will generate transaction fees and MEV revenue. The success of Stride and Neutron is the success of Cosmos Hub, since both share their block rewards with Cosmos Hub.\n\n\n\n## Details\n\n\nAccording to the agreed upon terms in Stride’s ICS proposal, this 450K ATOM will be stewarded by the ATOM Accelerator DAO. Established by Cosmos Hub prop 95, the ATOM Accelerator is comprised of several known, respected, and trusted members of the Cosmos Hub community.\n\nUpon receipt of the 450K ATOM, the members of the ATOM Accelerator will use it to establish an stATOM/ATOM liquidity position on Astroport Neutron. After the liquidity position has been established, the ATOM Accelerator won’t touch the liquidity unless instructed to via a Cosmos Hub signaling proposal.\n\nThe ATOM Accelerator’s stewardship of this liquidity is temporary. If an alternative arrangement to steward this liquidity is not established by Cosmos Hub governance before October 1st, 2023, then on that date the ATOM Accelerator will begin the process of returning the full 450K ATOM to the community pool.\n\n\n### Governance votes\nThe following items describe the voting options and their significance for this proposal:\n- **YES**: You wish to implement the provision of 450K ATOM to an stATOM/ATOM pool on Astroport Neutron, as previously agreed upon in Stride’s ICS signaling prop\n- **NO**: You do not wish to implement the liquidity provisioning agreement\n- **NO WITH VETO**: You 1) consider this proposal to be spam, 2) believe it infringes on minority interests, or 3) believe it violates the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

A failure to remove it will drastically decrease the speed at which the Cosmos Hub can be upgraded, and result in increased overhead to perform such upgrades.\n\nDue to its lack of utility and the costs of keeping it on the Hub, the module should be removed and the funds held therein should be returned to their owners.\n\n## Removal Details\nCurrently, the Liquidity module contains around ~$150,000 worth of un-withdrawn tokens. The developers of the Liquidity module have kindly prepared code to facilitate the removal of this module and get any remaining funds back to their rightful owners. Here is how this will happen:\n\nDuring the next planned Hub upgrade, a migration script will run which will return ~99% of the unwithdrawn tokens directly back to their owners.\n~1% of tokens (worth ~$1000) will remain which cannot be attributed to an owner.\nThis remaining ~1% will be transferred to the community pool. If in the future, the rightful owners come forward with evidence of their ownership, these tokens can be returned to them by governance proposal.\n\n## Proposal Outcomes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\nUpon a YES vote:\n\n- Development will continue on the removal of the Gravity DEX liquidity module and upon completion will be integrated into Gaia and rolled out in the next major release\n- Upon a Gaia rollout with this feature, all remaining funds will be sent back to originating accounts. Funds that are not owned by anyone (accrued tx fess, or other protocol-owned funds) will be sent to the community pool.\n- In a subsequent Gaia release, the module will removed completely\n\nUpon a NO vote:\n\n- Development will be on-hold and discussions with the community will continue to find the best path forward to remove the liquidity module and address the funds contained therein.\n\n- NO WITH VETO - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned\n\n- ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal\n\n### Previous Related Proposals\n- [#38](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/38) Signal Proposal to Adopt the Liquidity Module onto the Cosmos Hub. \n- [#45](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/45) Community Fund Governance Proposal For Gravity DEX Incentivized Testnet Prize Pool. \n- [#49](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/49) Signaling Proposal - Deployment of Gravity Bridge on the Cosmos Hub. \n- [#51](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/51) Governance Proposal for Gravity DEX Adoption to the Cosmos Hub. \n- [#62](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/62) 1 Signal Proposal: Migration of Gravity DEX to a Separate Cosmos Chain. \n- [#67](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/67) Parameter change: Enable liquidity module circuit breaker. \n\nA forum post for this proposal can be found [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-signalling-proposal-gravity-dex-liquidity-module-removal/10795/1).",0.004663698542318702],["ATOM Transfer Enablement\n\nA plan is proposed to set up a testnet using the Cosmos SDK v0.34.0 release, along with mainnet conditions, plus transfer enablement and increased block size, as a testing ground.

These corps lock the information, produced by the users, from search, social and commercial knowledge graphs in private databases, and then sell this knowledge back as advertisement. They stand as an insurmountable wall between content creators and consumers extracting an overwhelming majority of the created value.\n\nWe propose ATOM holders to invest 10,000 ATOM from the community pool into the Takeoff of Cyber. In exchange, at the end of its donation round (https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff), and when an IBC connection will become possible, cyber Congress will transfer CYB tokens back to the community pool. Passing this proposal will transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to cyber Congress multisig (https://www.mintscan.io/account/cosmos1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqv2tkd9a).\n\nFull Proposal-Manifest text: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUYDQt9tqLQJwxnUck7dQY3XmZA3tDtpFh3Hchkg7oH46\n\nor at https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff\n\nThe software we offer resembles a decentralized google (https://github.com/cybercongress):\n- A protocol spec and the rationale behind it\n- go-cyber: our implementation using cosmos-sdk\n- cyber.page: PoC reference web interface\n- launch-kit: useful tools for launching cosmos-sdk based chains\n- cyberindex: GraphQL middleware for cyber\n- euler Foundation: mainnet predecessor of cyber Foundation: the DAO, which will handle all the donated ETH\n- documentation and various side tools\n\nCyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics core of the Internet. It does so by opening up access to evergrowing semantics core taught to it by the users.\n\nEconomics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.\n\nYou already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.\n\nWith the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.\n\nCosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.\n\nA good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (с) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).\n\nThe solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.\n\nThis means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.\n\nIf this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will open another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in Game of Links (https://cyber.page/gol/) or Takeoff https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff independently.

ATOM is currently well positioned to play this role among Cosmos assets because it has the highest market cap, most liquidity, largest brand, and many integrations with fiat onramps. ATOM is the gateway to Cosmos.\n\nIn the Cosmos Hub Port City vision, ATOMs are pitched as equity in the Cosmos Hub.  However, this alone is insufficient to establish ATOM as the base currency of the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Instead, the ATOM community must work to actively promote the use of ATOMs throughout the Cosmos ecosystem, rather than passively relying on the Hub's reputation to create ATOM's value.\n\nIn order to cement the role of ATOMs in Cosmos DeFi, the Cosmos Hub should leverage its community pool to help align incentives with other protocols within the Cosmos ecosystem. We propose beginning this initiative by using the community pool ATOMs to incentivize deep ATOM base pair liquidity pools on the Osmosis Network.\n\nOsmosis is the first IBC-enabled DeFi application. Within its 3 weeks of existence, it has already 100x’d the number of IBC transactions ever created, demonstrating the power of IBC and the ability of the Cosmos SDK to bootstrap DeFi protocols with $100M+ TVL in a short period of time. Since its announcement Osmosis has helped bring renewed attention and interest to Cosmos from the crypto community at large and kickstarted the era of Cosmos DeFi.\n\nOsmosis has already helped in establishing ATOM as the Schelling Point of the Cosmos ecosystem.  The genesis distribution of OSMO was primarily based on an airdrop to ATOM holders specifically, acknowledging the importance of ATOM to all future projects within the Cosmos. Furthermore, the Osmosis LP rewards currently incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs of the platform.\n\nOsmosis has the ability to incentivize AMM liquidity, a feature not available on any other IBC-enabled DEX. Osmosis already uses its own native OSMO liquidity rewards to incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs, leading to ~2.2 million ATOMs already providing liquidity on the platform.\n\nIn addition to these native OSMO LP Rewards, the platform also includes a feature called “external incentives” that allows anyone to permissionlessly add additional incentives in any token to the LPs of any AMM pools they wish. You can read more about this mechanism here: https://medium.com/osmosis/osmosis-liquidity-mining-101-2fa58d0e9d4d#f413 . Pools containing Cosmos assets such as AKT and XPRT are already planned to receive incentives from their respective community pools and/or foundations.\n\nWe propose the Cosmos Hub dedicate 100,000 ATOMs from its Community Pool to be allocated towards liquidity incentives on Osmosis over the next 3 months. This community fund proposal will transfer 100,000 ATOMs to a multisig group who will then allocate the ATOMs to bonded liquidity gauges on Osmosis on a biweekly basis, according to direction given by Cosmos Hub governance.  For simplicity, we propose setting the liquidity incentives to initially point to Osmosis Pool #1, the ATOM/OSMO pool, which is the pool with by far the highest TVL and Volume. Cosmos Hub governance can then use Text Proposals to further direct the multisig members to reallocate incentives to new pools.\n\nThe multisig will consist of a 2/3 key holder set consisting of the following individuals whom have all agreed to participate in this process shall this proposal pass:\n\n- Zaki Manian\n- Federico Kunze\n- Marko Baricevic\n\nThis is one small step for the Hub, but one giant leap for ATOM-aligned.\n",0.42836103180581264],["Lowering Liquidity Pool Creation Fee\n\nAlthough the Gravity DEX launch on Cosmos Hub is technically successful, there exists several necessary ingredient to achieve significant user-base growth.\n\nIt includes of course, “farming incentives” for liquidity providers, but also the high pool creation fee disturbs quick adoption of pools with new tokens. The pool creation fee was introduced to prevent possible spamming attack to create tons of meaningless pools which will cause performance burden on Cosmos Hub.\n\nCurrently the fee(`PoolCreationFee`) is 40 Atoms, which is almost $1,600 as now. It was suggested when the Atom price is under $10, but now we have more reasons to make it significantly lower so that we can promote quicker new token introduction to the Gravity DEX.\n\nTherefore we suggest 5 Atoms for pool creation fee, which is equivalent to about $200.

The Cosmos Hub team at Interchain GmbH has done technical feasibility research by speaking with CosmWasm core contributors and validators to understand the burden of integration and believe it is technically feasible with resources in Interchain GmbH and Lido as well as regular advice meetings from Confio.\r\n\r\nThe instance of CosmWasm included on the Cosmos Hub will be governance gated and use Cosmos SDK v0.46.x. The governance feature set created by Confio, funded by [Prop 25](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/25), works so that all of the wasmd Message types can be executed by the chain’s governance module. These messages all otherwise have configurations so that they can be executed by one account, any account, or no accounts. Each message type should be set to “no account” so that it is only possible to execute messages with Governance. One alternative possibility that needs further review is whether to allow “one account” and designate it as the new governance module account to take advantage of the new features in the governance module coming in v8-Rho.\r\n\r\nCosmWasm on the hub comes with benefits and drawbacks that deserve serious attention.

This document marks the transition to the next phase of the Cosmos Hub as an infrastructure service platform, and a renewed role for ATOM as preferred collateral within the Cosmos Network. It describes two pieces of app-specific functionality, the Interchain Scheduler and Interchain Allocator, which together form a flywheel for accelerating interchain growth. The Interchain Scheduler is a cross-chain block space marketplace, which generates revenues from cross-chain MEV. These revenues are used by the Interchain Allocator to capitalize new Cosmos chains, foster interchain collaboration, and thereby expand the total addressable market of the Scheduler. This paper also describes a new issuance regime optimized for Liquid Staking, where after a 36 month transition period, exponential issuance is reduced to a constant amount of ATOM issued per month.

And a range of more specific, actionable insights on how to improve community health. We cant say what the specific insights are before doing the research, though.\n## About RnDAO\nWe're an R&D DAO with a mission to empower humane collaboration. Having already delivered research projects on sub-DAOs, DAO Conceptual Foundations, Decentralised Leadership, DAO Compensation and more: http:// rndao.mirror.xyz\n## Abstract\nLike many others, Cosmos depends on the health of its community and its vibez—yet understanding and measuring these factors (what we call Community Health) is challenging.\nToday, Web3 communities are left to rely on infrequent transactions data (on-chain records), while data from the significantly more frequent social interactions is limited to basic indicators of Discord or Discourse, Web2-oriented bots like Statsbot that give simplistic measurements, or a patchwork of “homemade” surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are ill-suited for DAO communities, surveys are time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results of these approaches, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.\nPerhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders and members without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market crashes, protocol migrations, etc.).\n## Specification\nFor the conceptual framework, we have assembled a team including two PhDs in network science and an organisation designer with significant DAO and community building experience to bridge both theory and practice. We've reviewed over 50 papers on the topics of Community, Social Network Analysis, Resilience, Trust, Engagement, and more. And are synthesising all of these findings to define the key indicators that have high validity and high predictive capacity for community health, while also taking a holistic perspective that accounts for member's wellbeing and planning to collect data across communities to offer an ecosystem health scrore too.\nFor the data collection tool, we're going beyond traditional surveys.\nThis research proposal focuses on the use of two critical techniques as a starting point:\nOrganizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how communications, information, and value creation occur through an organization based on interaction graphs. ONA has been shown to provide a wide range of insights to improve contributor retention, avoid member burnout, predict team performance and community resilience, identify key contributors, enable decentralization, and improve coordination. Although relatively new, ONA is gaining in popularity over traditional survey tools.\nPulse Surveys are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide qualitative and quantitative insights. In traditional organizations, they have been shown to increase employee response rate and employee engagement with related initiatives. They're also used as a tool for culture design and implementing culture change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys significantly reduce admin work for community managers and related roles. Importantly, these surveys offer an opt-out option from future prompts and are also framed to leverage coaching techniques to offer a prompt for reflection, thus offering value to participants as a recentering exercise on the value of community.\nThe data is anonymised and collected in a central repository for this first phase (we're exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a team having received ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should it be misused.\n## Rationale\nThe techniques used (ONA based on communication and Pulse Surveys) provide maximum insights on Community Health compared with exclusively on-chain data analysis. And provide minimum disruption for community members and minimal admin compared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially, the techniques selected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation by those less likely to respond to long surveys e.g. those less engaged and thus likely with the most valuable feedback to give.\nAlthough our initial focus is Community Health metrics, the proposed approach sets the foundation for further applications. Some of the potential applications and insights for Cosmos Hub and Cosmos-Chains-based DAOs are:\n* Generate baseline metrics for Community Health / vibez to quantify and better understand the impact that a specific event is having on a community and/or sub-groups within the community\n* Predict which contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive action (without breaching privacy\n* Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for improvement\n* Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or Insights metrics\n* Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment, community experience, etc. in near real-time\n* Attract talent and investment with objective Community Health metrics instead of proxy metrics like member count or proposal count, or financial metrics such as TVL\nIn addition to the initial research on Community Health, the potential applications mentioned above can enable more effective and targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities.\n## Why our Team\nTeam Leads\nKaterinabc\nPh.D. in Team Dynamics using Social Network Analysis, Teaching Collaboration, and Organizational Performance at Northwestern University (since 2016).\nCo-organized Learning in Networks sessions at the International Conference of Social Network Analysis (2018 - 2020), and previously advised a people analytics company on social network metrics.\nThegadget.eth\nSoftware Engineer.

Read Full Proposal here: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVr8zLF4KWTTNQ2wAyuSHygfEURrg2nP33b6aXrd19uDE\n\nOn Dec. 19, 2022, Cosmos Hub [Prop 88](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-88-accepted-increasing-hub-community-tax/8267) was accepted, and a tax was created to fund the community pool, ongoing. This large pool of capital is used for ecosystem growth through grants, development, and community building.\n\nThis new tax signals that the community is not content with the growth of the Hub, specifically for maintenance, development, grants, and funding.\n\nWith the signaling proposal of the V9 Lambda launch, Interchain Security (ICS), consumer chains, and Replicated Security are quickly becoming reality. A new narrative is emerging for the Cosmos Hub, a sustainable stream of real yield to $ATOM stakers. The Cosmos Hub has seen the emergence of 54 appchains. \n\nThe consumer chain narrative is new, untested, and relatively unknown to teams outside the Cosmos ecosystem. We will take on this challenge and change this.\n\nOur 3 objectives:\n\n1) Make over 1,000 developer teams Cosmos-aware. Create a developer and project awareness campaign around Replicated Security, IBC, and the consumer chain narrative.\n\n2) Support Replicated Security. AlphaGrowth will find, educate, recruit, and deploy grants to 20 or more DeFi projects that will launch on consumer chains. We will help find, educate, and recruit 1–2 consumer chain candidates.\n\n3) Map infrastructure and utility for consumer chains and map, foster, and communicate increases in ATOM utility.\n\n## Details\n\nFor more than 18 months, AlphaGrowth has helped acquire developers and dApps on behalf of ecosystems. In 2022, we helped source thousands of conversations and 40+ dApps deployed on Aurora EVM. In late 2022, we began working with Kava EVM to drive adoption of the DeFi narrative. Within two months, we helped drive 14 new dApps to Kava and continue to drive 10–15 dApps each month.

AiB seeks damages to be determined at trial, and asks the amount be “not less than $150,000.” \n\nIn our view, the lawsuit initiated by AiB constitutes a tortious act, which may result in unwarranted scrutiny and legal implications for $ATOM and the Cosmos network.  Let it be known that AiB has filed and financed a frivolous lawsuit against a community member utilizing funds given to them for the assumed propagation and development of open-source software. \n\nIt is our utmost concern that AiB initiated this legal action without a sound basis in a federal court lacking genuine jurisdiction, rendering the Cosmos network vulnerable to ramifications of AiB’s pleadings that declare the core technology framework to be both centralized and dominated by a founding Cosmos entity. \n\nIn light of this negative precedent established with AiB’s lawsuit, the objective of this proposal is to rectify the situation with a positive, restorative precedent. This proposal is designed to lend unequivocal support to Grace – for her fortitude in prioritizing the public interest in our public goods, over the limited interests of a private entity. \n\nAt this critical growth juncture, it is paramount that we assertively demand radical transparency from our founding organizations; however, this goal is rendered unachievable when tort systems are exploited to effect intimidation and harassment. \n\nWe earnestly implore the community to consider the full contents of this proposal, as its approval will signify and secure a commitment of resources needed to defend Grace and provide evidence to the American fiat courts that the Cosmos ecosystem – that our code and our culture, are truly decentralized products and experiences. \n\n The full text of this proposal is available via [IPFS link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeS7wp1mpkgLrXEosaL4d517aNKcfvzhDKdSy2XGGWjCY/QmcJtFw4xUpBuDoRNRKQeMCaZDuz7THemgWwc9Htv5Zghk)*\n\n**Objective:* \n\nBased on projected costs provided by law firms, we are requesting 50,000 ATOM to secure competent legal representation for Grace Yu. Grace will be seeking reimbursement for all legal costs and expenses from AIB.  Grace will work with Notional for any remittance/reimbursement of funds back to the Cosmos Hub community pool.\n\nAs of 4/5/23, AiB has communicated that in the event the Cosmos Hub passes a funding proposal for Grace’s legal defense fund, AiB “will reimburse the Cosmos community for the portion used.” \n\nIn the event the outcome of a settlement or a trial works in favor of the petitioner, and damages are awarded to AiB; Grace will not use any of the funds allocated to pay for damages. Funds allocated will be used strictly for her legal defense, only. \n\n**Arrangement:** \n\nIn the circumstance of successful passage of this proposal, the liquidation of ATOM will be executed in two tranches. The initial tranche will entail 25,000 ATOM which are to be converted into USDC by the undersigned parties of the multisig wallet after obtaining 2/3 authorization. Should the motion to dismiss the lawsuit prove to be unviable, this will trigger the second and concluding tranche which will liquidate the remaining 25,000 ATOM. \n\nIn the situation whereby AiB withdraws the lawsuit, and no legal costs and fees are awarded, the remainder of the designated legal funding, and its unspent balance will be duly restored to the hub. \n\n1.In the event the lawsuit settles, and Grace is awarded legal costs and fees without personal or compensatory damages, she will use those funds to reimburse the community pool in full, and will not retain any of the payment until the community pool is fully reimbursed. \n2. In the event Grace is unable to claim reimbursement of legal fees from AiB, and should there be unused funds remaining at the conclusion of the matter, she will return the balance of the funds using MsgFundCommunityPool. \n3. In the event Grace is awarded any personal and compensatory damages, separate from legal costs and fees, she will remit 33.33% of awarded damages (post tax) back to the hub, any reimbursement of legal costs and fees, in addition to any balance remaining from her her legal defense fund using MsgFundCommunityPool. \n\nNote on flow \n\ni. This proposal seeks 50,000 ATOM \nii. The multisig group will transfer ATOM to Osmosis to convert ATOM to USDC. \niii. USDC will be sent to Grace’s law firm via Bitpay transaction. \niv. Grace’s law firm will provide a written letter to confirm receipt of funds, and that letter and redacted invoices will be uploaded to the Cosmos hub forum. Redactions are necessary to protect the attorney-client privilege, as well as Grace. \n\n**Transparency** \n\nMonthly legal invoices will be uploaded to www.dropthelawsuit.org. Narrative descriptions of work performed on the invoices will be redacted to preserve privacy, along with work-product and attorney-client privileged information. Once the matter of AiB v Grace Yu is settled, Grace will provide a report as to how the funds were spent. Providing a transparency report during the course of litigation would compromise the discretion her legal team requires to execute on tactical objectives and could waive the attorney-client privilege. \n\n**Why We Need to Fund #FreeGrace #dropthelawsuit:** \n\n* Cosmos is an assemblage of software components that operate under the open source model.\n* Compliance with regulatory requirements necessitates the decentralization of Cosmos code. \n* Open-source developers are afforded the privilege of seamlessly migrating their work alone or under the auspices and sponsorship of different organizations; hence, any practice that opposes open-source tenets, such as the AiB modus operandi, is not only contrary to established open-source norms but also undermines the fostering of an innovative culture that is indispensable for the competitive propagation of software code. \n* Multilateral contributions to open source software frameworks is perceived as an indicator of maturity and resilience.  An increase in diverse contributions to open-source software amplifies its reach, thereby guaranteeing a more thorough review process. This is in line with the well-known adage that “more eyes make for fewer bugs.”  \n* Due to Grace’s advocacy, a former Tendermint and Ignite contributor, Denis Fadeev is now free to engage in activities of his choosing – including the ability to continue work on the project he created independent of AiB. This outcome is attributable to Denis’ persistence, supported by the efforts of the #FreeDenis community facilitated by Grace Yu. \n* While we recognize that the values of the Cosmos may not appear coherent at first glance, there is a fundamental alignment that we all share. This alignment, is the inalienable right to freedom of speech, and the freedom of expression. \n* Protecting these freedoms are necessary to evince an alternative decentralized financial system dependent on radical transparency, accountability, open-source, and decentralization for legitimacy and resilience. \n* The Cosmos Hub will be exercising its sovereign authority to protect a community member from a founding organization in a manner that is both unprecedented and essential to preserving the values vital to the Cosmos vision. \n* The Cosmos Hub would indirectly assert itself in a matter being adjudicated in a fiat court, in the prestigious Eastern District of New York. \n\n**Multisig Address**\ncosmos17p0ssxp4dwnr4qvs7kgm4currxfmaatkh4gcl3 \n\n**Signers:** \n\nGreg Osuri, Akash \nMike Purvis, Croncat \nJohn Macleod, ConsensusOne Validator \n\n***Note**\n\nThis proposal represents the opinions of the draftees and is based upon draftees’ understanding of the events, and or, in addition to the understanding that has been set forth in the lawsuit.

It deals with genuine spam proposals very well. But what does it mean under the hood? Well, what it means under the hood is that you vote for no and you vote for veto at the same time, you’re making two votes. If the tally for veto reaches 33%, the deposit on the proposal is burned and the proposal automatically fails.\n\nSince there is absolutely no way to mandate a definition of spam and everybody is going to interpret that differently and it makes no sense whatsoever to argue about that, I propose that we nullify proposal 75, AND free the authors of governance proposals from writing tedious vote options because those are defined very well in the software. Luckily, our community is more than intelligent enough to interpret on their own, what the vote options do, and the documentation of the vote options is highly effective.\n\nFinally, I believe that it makes sense to require only explaining the yes option, as doing otherwise can land a punter in hot water.\n\nTherefore, to make governance simpler in all ways, and increase participation in governance, and remove the crazy burn two sticks of incense and say 10 hail Marys before approaching Cosmos hub governance to save thyself from Gaia’s proceduralist faction, we should do the logical thing, and require only that YES, be defined.

We’re bullish on Evmos\n* The goal for the hackathon event is to support ecosystem building after launch at a critical market condition. Incentives include $500k grants, over $500k investment, at least $10m liquidity, express IDO/IEO listing and incubation/advisory support to winning teams deployed on Evmos\n* It is proposed to have a 50-50 split of grants between Evmos community & Web3scholarship and sponsors, where $250k worth of Evmos tokens are asked for as grants to winning teams. Venture funding and liquidity come from Web3scholarship.\n* What we ask from Evmos community: 125,000 Evmos tokens (assuming Evmos price of $2USD according to roughly last 14 day average price). The principle is to provide $250k worth of Evmos tokens, therefore the actual number of tokens distributed may depend on future price performance close to (average 30 day Evmos token price prior) initial prize distribution i.e. the winning team announcement date . If > $2, no more tokens are needed and remaining undistributed tokens stay at Evmos community. If less, then vice versa applies(open to revision).\n* Prize tracks: Grand prize(80k), Defi/Infra/ Web3/Metaverse Track prize (100k*4), EVM Migration prize (20k)\n\n\n\nReasoning and Potential Impact:\n* After Evmos mainnet is live and network is stable, it creates good window for ecosystem building whereas currently there is only Evmos limited grant available for devs. \n* The goal is to incentivize growth of key pillars of DeFi, NFT and Infrastructure of Evmos ecosystem at early stage, and teams of high aptitude will see a tangible leap in terms of performance and adoption via incentives and incubation.\n* Web3Scholarship is diverse & strong to provide attractive incentives and valuable incubation. The event is likely to get momentum for the ecosystem and ahchieve network effect.\n\n\n\nDeliverables and Timeline:\nThe whole event will firstly take 1 month planning starting from now and 1 and half months for the actual event. Event period is planned to be from July 7 to August 22. During which, Evmos specific developer support such as AMA and tutorials will be offered. \n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n* Goals: It is expected to have over 1,000 developers signed in, over 60 submissions and produce 3-5 investable projects and 1-2 flagships.\n* Avoid rug: strict scrutiny; code review; criteria; penalty clause\n* Quality projects: selective criteria; dev turnout: referrals\n* Dev turnout: galvanizing 10+ communities including Devpost, Dorahacks\n* Community engagement: will utilize hack platform to involve community vote in the selection of winning teams. \n\nProtection clause: Penalty and protection clause to be made so event host & sponsor are entitled to reject or make conditional fund provision.\n\nDistribution transparency:\nTo ensure a proper and synchronized grant distribution from both Evmos and Web3Scholarship, gnosis safe will be established and used for offering grants.\n\nAt last, features industry wide collaboration & contribution, we hope to spur growth at this critical point of time by this event.

Developers will be able to mint secure endpoints via https://www.portal.pokt.network/ and benefit from our dev rel support, and endpoint security features. Additionally, we will provide a public-exposed endpoint. ( There is one we are already contributing to at https://evmos-json-rpc.stakely.io/ ).\n\n Pocket Network is a decentralized RPC service that enables a permissionless network of independent node operators to be incentivized for running full nodes for blockchains supported by the network. Daaps pay for RPC throughput by staking POKT token, and node operators are compensated in POKT token based on RPC requests served. The beauty of this model is a positive feedback loop that is created: as the usage of the RPC increases, the incentive payout for node runners also increases, thus incentivizing more full nodes to spin up and strengthening the overall RPC service. \n\n This model reduces central points of failure within the RPC layer, while increasing geographic distribution, redundancy, and censorship resistance.  We currently support over 20 blockchain networks including many popular EVM protocols.  We have recently added support for Evmos EVM mainnet.

In fact, Evmos exists today because of [Cosmos Hub Proposal #44](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-44-accepted-advancing-ethermint-gtm-and-engineering-plan-for-the-ethermint-chain/4554)\n\n---\n\n ## **The Event** \n\n**Announcing Cosmos’s HackATOM Seoul**\n\nHackAtom Seoul, Organized by Interchain in collaboration with the talented KryptoSeoul team, will be our first in-person Hackathon since 2019 and the first Cosmos-branded event in the Asian continent since the pandemic began. The full announcement [can be read here](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-cosmoss-hackatom-seoul-b6858b9beac7).\n\n**Participating IBC Frens:**\n\n* Cosmos Hub, Interchain Foundation, Cosmostation, Osmosis, Crescent, Juno, plus more (check announcement).\n\n**Date**: July 29-31\n**Location**: Hanwha Dreamplus, Seoul\n\n---\n\n ## **Community Funding Request** \n\nThe requested amount as it stands is $168K, with the bulk of it going towards hackathon prizes and developer outreach. $50K allocated for marketing and PR will come from the waived sponsorship fee from Interchain Foundation.\n\n **A. Sponsorship Fees**\n\nPlatinum Sponsorship Package (Fee Waived) Includes:\n\n* 1 booth at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 1 judging seat at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 1 workshop at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 10-minute speaker spot at the Welcome Ceremony, Day 1 \n* Co-host at Official Afterparty at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* Evmos marketing one-pager included in Welcome Packet \n* HackAtom badges printed with your Evmos under Platinum Sponsor \n* Evmos logo insignia on the marketing video produced during HackAtom Seoul 2022\n\n### **B. Hackathon Prizes**\n\nThe prize amount was selected simply based on the amount that Osmosis and Juno are offering ($100K each). \n\n[Current Hackathon Challenges and Prize Pool](https://bafybeienbj44fytisfpq6a5svc5t32qcxgwjvdkqejfys2degjnhhotbkm.ipfs.dweb.link/tracks.png)\n\nThe final hackathon tracks will be discussed and determined with the core dev team as well as with consultation from evmos4volunteers.\n\n### **C. Marketing and PR Expenses**\n\nThe numbers that I am providing are currently derived as best estimates from my past experiences with sponsoring and hosting events. Past events include Blockshow Vegas 2018, BlockchainNW Seattle 2018, LA Blockchain Week 2018, Global AI Conference in Santa Clara, Consensys 2019, LA Blockchain Week 2019, E3 2019 blockchain gaming, and a dozen smaller meetups. \n\n**PR Expenses** - Evmos is unique in the Cosmos ecosystem because we are able to tap into a much bigger pool of developers (devs already familiar with solidity). It is my belief that if we are committing $100K into the hackathon, we should do our absolute best to make sure that there is a great turnout with talented developers. \n\nRight off the bat, I would like to explore one or two paid PR placements in Korea's top blockchain publications and developer networks. Depending on who, when, and how, this can range anywhere from $5K to $10K. However, we will aim for the lower-end of the range while leveraging the existing network of IBC frens.\n\nI will be consulting a few blockchain incubation and investment firms that I am acquainted with for additional advice on how to best penetrate the Korean ETH developer market. There may be some last minute promotions, such as small token giveaways or ad placements in developer-heavy social networks. \n\n**Marketing Expenses** - Following the HackAtom event, three events will be held consecutively: buidl.asia, ETH Seoul, and Korea Blockchain Week. This gives us a great opportunity to do further outreach beyond the scope of the hackathon, through smaller meetups, cross-promotions, and related events. Side events, when executed properly, can be much more effective than sponsoring the event itself. \n\nFrom start to finish, the events will last from July 29th to August 13th. This is a pretty epic blockchain marathon, and the possilities and opportunities for developer onboarding, meetups, workships, and side events are endless. \n\n**Booth and Evmos Merch** - Because of the limited time to prepare, booth design and merch will likely have to be rushed. After speaking with Interchain Foundation and the HackAtom organizers, booth design will not require a significant budget.\n\nAround $2K will be allocated for Evmos merch / swag.\n\n### **D. Airfare + Accomodations + Miscellaneous Expenses**\n\nFor those that have boothed at crypto events, you'll know that _it is not easy._ I have discussed with BeeHive, a respected Korean validator and community that is active in Evmos as well as other Cosmos chains, and have confirmed their willingness to help boothing as well as provide translation services. While the event will bring the global community to Seoul, it should be expected that a huge portion of the attendees will, of course be Korean. \n\nAt the moment airfare to Korea from the States as well as Europe are well over $2K. Assuming that four Evmos representaives will in attendance, the cost for airfare should exceed just over $10K. Prices will likely fluctuate between now and then. Accomodation for housing is showing anywhere from $4K to $6K for the time periods of the events.\n\nLoredana from evmos4volunteers has been requested to attend to assist with technical discussions, which the community seems to be overwhelming in favor for. We are waiting for a final confirmation from loredana.\n\n## **Fund Usage, Transparency, and Accountability** \n\n1. All expenses incurred will be documented and itemized, from A to D. Whatever  transactions that can be done on chain will be done so. For expenses that require fiat, an expense report will be provided after the event. \n2. All unused funds will be returned to the community pool.\n3. $20K of the marketing and PR budget will be sent to a multi-sig wallet, while $20K will be held in a liquid wallet so that we can immediately get to work on the countless tasks and preparations that need to be made. \n4. The hackathon prize pool will also be sent to a multi-sig wallet and distributed post-event.\n5. I will work with the core team to be as frugal as possible, while consulting with them to take as many opportunities that would benefit Evmos and help with onboarding and exposure.\n\n## **Time Constraints** \n\nJuly 29th is fast approaching. I will continue to be in constant contact with the HackAtom organizers, blockchain incubators and communities, and everyone in between.\n\n## **Other Considerations** \n\nWe have decided not to sponsor KBW directly, but have confirmed with KBW organizers that whatever side event we decide to host, they will include it in their official list of events, which allows us to tap into their pool of attendees. With that being said, if at any point or time something doesn't feel right, or we feel that our spending is not justified, we can simply decide to not host anything, and return the remaining funds to the community pool.\n\n## Multisig Signatories\n\n3 out of 5 signatories for multisig execution is proposed:\n- LPX (myself, who will be coordinating much of logistics here in Seoul)\n- Three team members / volunteer in attendance (Adonis, Tricky, and Loredana if she is able to make it)\n- One team member not present in Korea.\n\n---\n\nReference Links:\n\n* [HackAtom Seoul 2022 Event Page](https://www.buidl.asia/hackatom-seoul-2022) \n* [Cosmos Signaling Proposal](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-signaling-proposal-hackatom-seoul-2022/6799?u=catdotfish) \n* [Official Cosmos Announcement](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-cosmoss-hackatom-seoul-b6858b9beac7) \n* [HackAtom Official Site](https://hackatom.org/)\n* [ETH Seoul 2022](https://2022.ethseoul.org/)\n* [Blockchain Week Korea 2022](https://koreablockchainweek.com/)\n* [discoverEVMOS](https://evmos.builders)\n\nA huge thank you to [@catdotfish](https://twitter.com/catdotfish) from Interchain and Erica from KryptoSeoul for the help in organizing this proposal.",0.045216362504852614],["Airdrop claim courtesy proposal\n\nVote on this to claim the relevant portion of your airdrop",0.13245992903198656],["Parameter change: maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.\n\n**Summary: decrease maximum deposit time to 72 hours and increase proposal deposit amount to 192 EVMOS.** \n\nThis param change proposal will decrease the maximum deposit time to 72 hours (three days) and raise the minimum deposit amount to 192 EVMOS.

And the best location for me to influence the future tech for the benefit of the Evmos blockchain is Berlin. I would personally like to continue my work remotely and transparently (e.g. github, videos), but I found that it is very hard for other people to collaborate without face-to-face meetings.\n**The Evmos community would only sponsor my rent in Berlin (apartment + office), effectively sponsoring my lobby services, for the benefit of Evmos. My tech effort will remain a volunteer contribution, unpaid.**\n\n## Why should Evmos sponsor lobbying?\nBecause a multi-chain standard (like I am proposing) requires a controller chain to have a correct state view.

The ratification of the Interim Constitution can be seen as the first of many steps in the formation of Evmos DAO.\n\nThis Interim Constitution has been in ideation and discussion for over a month, including [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6082-final-rfc-the-evmos-constitution), The Evmos Validator Fairness Initiative group, and multiple weekly governance calls.\n\n---\n\n# The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO\n\n## Preamble: The Declaration\n\nWe, the Evmos Community, formally declare our shared beliefs and mission to build and assist in growing the Evmos network. We strive to be the leading EVM network in the Cosmos Ecosystem, utilizing the Cosmos SDK modules, Tendermint's consensus engine, and the Inter Blockchain Protocol for a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, interoperable chain. The Evmos network, our community, and our governance processes must strive to play a role in laying the foundation for a more equitable, hyper-connected, decentralized future.\n\n## 1. The Evmos Community\n\nThe Evmos Community (\"community\") is a general all-encompassing term that comprises various groups that are participants in the Evmos network. The level and degree of participation may vary by group, but the common denominator of all members of the community should be the shared interest in the continued growth of the Evmos network.\n\n**1. Protocol Developers** - this group of developers focuses mainly on improving the Evmos network on the protocol level; this group includes core developers as well as individual contributors not considered as core team members.\n\n**2. Network Validators** - network validators are key members of the community responsible for securing the network through the Tendermint proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\n**3. Network Delegators** - network delegators are the predominant group that assist in network consensus and security by delegating power to validators through the staking of tokens.\n\n**4. Workstream and Committee Members** - workstream and committee members are those that work to improve and grow the Evmos network on a non-protocol level.\n\n**5. Community Leaders** - workstreams and special projects, although not required, may have an appointed leader to steward and lead his or her group.\n\n**6. Application Developers and End Users** - application developers and end users are those that develop, deploy, utilize, interact, transact, and ultimately bring value to the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nWhile the aforementioned groups make up the majority of the community, the definition and composition of the community are not strictly limited to these groups.\n\n## 2. The Evmos Governance Framework\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework (\"framework\") is the foundational set of guidelines and processes developed for the community and network contributors to follow and flourish. The framework should be designed to recognize and incentivize contributors and curate a culture that creates long-term, positive-sum interactions between all community members and the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nThe framework is to be proposed and adopted separately from the Constitution. The Constitution shall take priority over the Governance Framework and should be regarded as the supreme guiding document.\n\n## 3. Guiding Principles\n\n**1. Progressive Decentralization:** The Evmos network aims to be as decentralized as possible, in the context of network validation as well as governance and finances. While network resiliency and the decentralization of power is paramount, we recognize the need to proceed with strategic and scientific-based planning. The community must not haphazardly rush into decisions that may potentially destabilize the chain or provoke a strong negative community reaction. The community will take the stance of progressive decentralization as we research and analyze the social, legal, and/or financial ramifications our decisions may potential have.\n\n**2. Neutrality and Non-Partisanship:** We believe in the principles of equality for all and must act in accordance with this core principle. All groups and community members have equal access to information, equal rights, and equal responsibilities, as defined by this Constitution. No one group or community member should be favored over any other members. No one group or community member should be disfavored over any other members. We define \"favor\" as an unfair benefit that is not a direct consequence of provable effort and actions done, in alignment with our mission and goals. We define \"disfavor\" as an unfair punishment or loss of opportunity that is not a direct consequence of provable actions done against Evmos’ mission and goals.\n\n**3. User-Centrism:** Evmos is specialized to provide a unique EVM experience in the Cosmos ecosystem. We must therefore continue to optimize for 1) user adoption and 2) the qualities that contribute to steady growth: network liquidity, improvement of user experience, data sovereignty, stable production of blocks, educational resources, strong governance, etc.\n\n**4. Agnosticism:** Evmos should maintain neutrality as a chain with roots in both the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. While the governance of Evmos may be reliant from time to time on other networks or tools, the Evmos community should retain a stance of neutrality. Community members must leave tribalism at the door; we should refrain from engaging in political debates that are not directly relevant to improving the Evmos network.\n\n**5. Cross-Chain Diplomacy:** Evmos is a network with a long history in the decentralization movement, with inspirations, ideas, protocols, and allies in various networks. Our community will come from a wide range of blockchain communities. Cross-chain collaborations, outreach initiatives, diplomacy missions, and continued participation in events are highly encouraged — especially with chains from the EVM and IBC ecosystems.\n\n**6. Consensual Collaboration:** While the Cosmos SDK’s implementation of governance is relatively permissionless, this does not mean anyone is entitled to work or compensation. Proposals will be assessed by the community on their merits alone and eventually voted on. In addition, proposals must follow the Governance Framework of the Evmos network and adhere to the principles outlined in the Constitution.\n\n**7. Sovereignty to Work:** The purpose of the Governance Framework is not to micro-manage proposals or teams. Sovereignty will be given to those that are working in accordance with the original proposal passed by the community, and are not in violation of any governance processes or principles of the Constitution.\n\n## 4. Removal of Community Leaders\n\nAll community members appointed to a role of higher responsibility, including workstream members, may be removed via a formal vote on-chain. The Governance Framework shall outline the appointment, removal, and appeals process, along with a detailed dispute resolution guideline.\n\n## 5. Constitutional Rights\n\nThe Governance workstream shall amend a Bill of Rights to the Constitution as soon as a general consensus can be confidently reached.\n\n## 6. Constitutional Amendments and Revisions\n\nThe community holds the power to propose an amendment to the Constitution by following the standard Evmos Proposal Lifecycle. The reasoning for the amendment must be justified and petitioned. If possible, there should be an attempt made to resolve the issue before a proposal for amendment is initiated.\n\n---\n\n**Validator/Community Code of Conduct and Constitutional Rights**\n\nWe recognize that this Constitution is missing a few key topics — however, we also see the need to tread carefully in these sensitive and controversial topics. While it is inarguable that these are necessary components of the Constitution, there was clear signaling that we needed more time to allow for the natural growth of the community before we could formally ratify some sections with confidence. We pledge to continue our research and continue to engage with the community to find general consensus on the best step forward. While some topics will be amended into the Constitution when they are ready, most will likely be implemented through the Governance Framework.\n\n---\n\n# Your Votes... \n\n**By voting YES**, you are signing the Constitution to be ratified so that the Governance workstream can shift focus and begin introducing components of the the Governance Framework that will allow for the creation of more  workstreams and special growth projects / committees / teams. Voting YES does not necessarily mean that you are fully content — but you will allow it.\n\n**By voting ABSTAIN**, you are signaling that you did not read the Constitution or do not understand its content or its purpose.\n\n**By voting NO**, you refuse to accept the Constitution at its current state.\n\n**By voting NO WITH VETO**, you are showing complete opposition to the Constitution and would rather leave the community than to have it ratified at its current state.",0.0028275340276851337],["Fund DIA Randomness Oracle Gas Fees for 1 Year\n\nFull discussion: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6662-ideation-fund-dia-randomness-orcale-gas-fees-for-1-year \n Hi All, \n 0xCtrlAltApe here from the Orbital Apes team. I am starting this discussion to help launch DIA Randomness Oracles on Evmos. I am not affiliated with the DIA team in anyway.\n DIA provides an on-chain randomness oracle solution for EVM chains. If deployed the randomness oracle can be used by any smart contract on Evmos. While the DIA team does not charge for oracle usage, they do ask that gas fees to maintain the oracle are provided to launch on a new chain. By the DIA teams estimations this would be roughly 44 evmos/day which equals to 16060 Evmos for the year.\n Randomness oracles will allow for more innovative and new types of applications to be built on Evmos. Currently there are no options available for randomness on-chain on Evmos.

Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the v8.1.0 software includes the following improvements:\n\n* [Feesplit module](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/feesplit/): Developers can register their smart contracts and earn rewards everytime someone interacts with their registered smart contract\n* Upgrade to Ethermint [v0.19.2](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.19.2): Improves JSON-RPC reliability and maintainability and bumps SDK, Tendermint and IAVL dependencies and adds supports for optional params on EIP712\n* Upgrade ibc-go to [v3.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.45.7]\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nPrior to this proposal the version v8.1.0 is been upgraded to and tested on the [Evmos Testnet](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/72).\n\nAdditionally, the Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade.

It is the de-facto way to have EVM-powered Cosmos chains.\n- Ethermint's is developed and maintained by Tharsis & other contributors & volunteers.\n- [Kava](https://www.kava.io/) is \"One Network. Two Chains. Ethereum and Cosmos.\"\n- Kava is today valued at ~$400M market cap\n- Estimated total value locked: ~$140M\n- Initial investment in building and marketing Kava is less than $1M\n- \"Kava Rise Program: $750M Developer Incentive Program. The structure of the Rise program will focus primarily on driving adoption and growth for the new Ethereum Co-Chain.\"\n- Kava Community Pool has ~80M KAVA tokens\n- Kava uses Ethermint for their Ethereum Co-Chain and Cosmos SDK for Cosmos in [their code](https://github.com/Kava-Labs)\n- Tharsis made [this Commonwealth proposal](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6684-external-evm-infrastructure-funding-proposal-on-kava) to the Evmos and Kava communities, \"requesting 3M out of ~80M KAVA tokens (3.7%) from the Kava Community Pool Treasury to fund, develop and advance critical EVM Infrastructure through the Ethermint Engineering and R&D team for 1 year.\", followed by opening a [Kava Community Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/wsa37v/evm_infrastructure_funding_proposal_on_kava/). Resulting in the formal [on-chain Kava proposal #96](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/96)\n- Proposal #96 was rejected. 13/21 of the top validators votes YES, 1/21 voted ABSTAIN, and 7/21 did not vote.

With no link to any Kava Community discussion. This proposal passed.\n- \"The Kava DAO is a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Kava Network. Made up of the Kava stakers and validators that help to secure and run the network\"\n- Kava did not make any concrete offers to reward past development efforts for Ethermint\n\n## Why the Evmos Community has standing?\n\n- Evmos uses Ethermint as core infrastructure\n- Tharsis has most funds from the $EVMOS coin growth, so the Evmos chain became the de-facto treasurer for Tharsis\n- The Evmos Community are the guardians of Evmos interests, which include Ethermint and the well-being of Tharsis devs\n\n## Inter-Chain Diplomacy\n\nRight now, Ethermint tech is an exportable product from the Evmos chain to all other chains that do not make development effort towards it (but use it), therefore the payment should be in $EVMOS.\n\nThe Evmos community now has the standing to make a funding proposal in the name of Tharsis, in $EVMOS, first on the Evmos governance, then on Kava.\n\nGiven that the Kava Community rejected the request for funding Ethermint's future development, for 1 year, we propose that another funding request should be made to Kava by the Evmos Community, for past development efforts, that have already taken place and have already brought value to Kava. Any other future funding requests will be discussed separately.\n\nOff-chain polls & discussion for price discovery were opened in [Evmos Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6867-external-ethermint-funding-proposal-on-kava-price-discovery-vote).\n\n## What will Kava stand to gain?\n\nEthermint will enter the most technically interesting phase: custom precompiles and EVM-Inter-Chain. Working prototypes already exist and were presented https://youtu.be/x75UobIr4qo?t=14670 and the ground work for Ethermint was set with https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/pull/1272.\n\n(proposal lead:) I have personally developed the Go groundwork for inter-chain cooperation and deployed three public technical blockchains with EVM-Cosmos (Mythos, Ethos, and Logos), for demoing the inter-chain tech and I will re-base my work on the Ethermint extensibility of EVM precompiles.\nSome precompiles that I created that are pertinent to this:\n- abstract accounts (implementing account abstraction for EVM https://hackmd.io/@matt/r1neQ_B38)\n- quasar: ability to run Cosmos transactions from EVM\n- IBC precompile for EVM\n- nBridge: n-way (n>=2) generalized bridge by transaction replay\n(Demos at: https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos)\n\nNext generation protocols are inter-chain. If Kava rewards past Ethermint development efforts, and demonstrates will to collaborate, it has a chance to be invited to benefit from the EVM-Inter-Chain innovations. This is no longer Ethermint, it is next-generation Ethermint (with extensions) and licensing may be subjected to change if context requires it.\nWe hope the Kava Community will not choose the short-term frugality over long-term greater benefits. Especially that this is an ethical opportunity that benefits Kava as image, Evmos, and the whole Cosmos.\n\n\n## Why should the Cosmos Community care?\n\n1. Blockchains are entities with communities. So, we need to have rules for behaving between chains. The proposal is bringing clarity to what is civil between chains (in this case, pertaining to funding previous dev efforts). Rejecting a proposal from Tharsis is different than rejecting a proposal from the Evmos Community. Kava and Evmos are part of the larger Cosmos Inter-Chain ecosystem.\n2. This proposal's purpose is to find a general way to determine a fair ask for any other chains, not only Kava.\n3. Ethermint is a core piece of infrastructure that brings value to Cosmos. The Cosmos Community should fight to keep it open-source and well-developed.\n4. Fairly rewarding effort made to evolve Cosmos is critical to inter-chain cooperation.\n5. Upholding the values of decentralized governance in each chain is a critical requirement for any inter-chain cooperation.\n\n\n## Votes\n\nIf you vote YES: This proposal will be posted on Kava's subreddit, for Kava Community feedback. And then, as an on-chain proposal to the Kava Community.\n\n\n## Proposal Lead\n\nThis proposal was led on behalf of the Evmos Community, by Loredana Cirstea - elected by vote in the Evmos Interchain Office (Evmos Governance proposal #45) and a volunteer from The Laurel Project (https://evolve.provable.dev/). This proposal is made from a volunteer capacity (independent, unpaid, self-funded, and from the heart).\n",0.0682304495179783],["Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program\n\n## Summary \n\nThis proposal, also known as [\"Kickstart DeFi on Evmos\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6977-prevote-kickstart-defi-on-evmos) from Commonwealth, will begin the Evmos DAO Liquidity Incentives Program with the bootstrapping of liquidity pools on the Diffusion DEX. More initiatives are in the works with other DeFi projects, and will be proposed when ready.\n\n## Motivation \n\nThe Evmos blockchain has the potential to become a unique environment for DeFi in the IBC ecosystem, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth. We have also had very attractive staking APR that gave a higher return than most liquidity pools, and a bridge exploit that destroyed the TVL of Evmos DeFi in a matter of hours.\n\nDespite the hurdles, we are confident in saying that we had great success with our incentivization initiative for the EVMOS/OSMO pool through Prop 39 which provided 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days on the Osmosis DEX. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis in nearly all areas including TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 5th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $9.8M and one of the highest volume pools of over $3M. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring soon, and while we do plan on extending the Osmosis program, we must also begin looking inward: our native TVL.\n\n## Strategy \n\nAs more EVMOS tokens are staked, the APR rates have been decreasing at an accelerated rate. Millions of tokens are being unbonded at this moment, and without alternative pools with very appealing rates, they will most likely be going to Osmosis to be sold. Our first priority is to 1) build the much needed liquidity to wean off our reliance on Osmosis pools for liquid markets; 2) attract fellow IBC friends to participate in our high rewards programs and attract the unbonding Evmos tokens to find its way into these incentivized pools.\n\nThe Community Treasury is currently sitting around 33mil EVMOS tokens with 75mil+ EVMOS tokens returning from the unclaimed airdrops, and with an usage incentives escrow wallet which is now nearing 35mil tokens.\n\nIn total, roughly 143mil EVMOS (~$357mil @ $2.5), is left sitting with no benefits, when they can be put to strategic use that not only encourages more network participants, but also brings the community rewards for helping with the bootstrap initiative.\n\nIn summary, this is an aggressive but needed first step in further growing the Evmos network. Liam from Evmos explains eloquently in [this comment](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6977-prevote-kickstart-defi-on-evmos?comment=30063) why this proposal is so important. We highly suggest reading the comment for context.\n\n ## Plan of Action \n\nDiffusion will be the first DEX to receive incentives, as they have been the leading DEX prior to the Nomad exploit. More protocols and DeFi projects will follow, with programs of their own.\n\nDiffusion will continue with their DIFF rewards for existing pools, resulting in *double rewards* for the pools that will be incentivized further with Evmos tokens.\n\n2mil EVMOS tokens will be released into a Gnosis Safe (3/5 signatures). Over the course of 90 days, the allocated EVMOS rewards will be released into Diffusion's staking contract (MiniChefv2 & Audited). We are initially aiming to minimize risk by releasing the funds every two weeks allowing time for assessments, and if needed, the re-balancing of rewards for underperforming pools. \n\nThe multisig will be managed by: \n\n- 3 Evmos DAO Governance members (Benny Lava, Tricky, LPX)\n- 1 Diffusion team member (mercenaryApe)\n- 1 Validator (Swiss Staking)\n\n## Incentives Allocations \n\nThe EVMOS incentives will go towards attracting liquidity for EVMOS pairs with ATOM, WETH, WBTC, OSMO, JUNO, DIFF, and USDC pools. The EVMOS token incentive breakdown for those pools would be as follows:\n\n**Category: Major (50%)**\n\n- EVMOS / ATOM - 400k \n- EVMOS / wETH - 400k (200k each Axelar, Celer) \n- EVMOS / wBTC - 200k (66.7K each Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Celer)\n\n**Category: Stablecoins (35%)**\n\n- EVMOS / Stablecoins - 700k (USDC split evenly between Axelar and Celer -- USDT and DAI for Gravity Bridge)\n\n**Category: Minor (15%)**\n\n- EVMOS / OSMO - 100k \n- EVMOS / JUNO - 100k \n- EVMOS / DIFF - 100k \n\nFor the kickoff program, we propose the equal distribution of incentives between the bridged assets **with the exception of gUSDC and gWETH pools**, as they are already being incentivized and are locked into smart contracts for the time being. This distribution will take course over a 90 day period.\n\n**Rebalancing of Pool Allocations** - Over the first 14 days funds will be split evenly between pools in each category, followed by distribution proportionate to each pool's TVL & Volume accordingly. 50% of the category incentives based upon TVL, and 50% based upon volume to fairly distribute incentives to the most valuable pools.\n\nRough TVL and APR targets per pool: [Graphical Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16395727/192321522-df012984-1edf-4a39-b9df-b3d959a532c5.png) \n\n## Future Plans \n\nFuture proposals can use this data to gauge their own bridge incentives. This will help the most desired liquidity continue to come onto Evmos and maintain attractive APRs while doing so. We are currently aiming to hit a TVL of $20mil on Evmos by the end of the year (across the entire network).\n\n2mil EVMOS is less than 1.5% of our available funds, and covers an entire DEX including interchain assets on Evmos. When compared to the 0.5% spent for a single EVMOS/OSMO pool, we firmly believe that this kickoff initiative is reasonable. We are currently working on a standardized framework in which these processes can be streamlined and more transparent; we thank the community for your patience and thank you to all those that have participated in the discussion stage of the proposal.\n\n**About Diffusion:**\n\nDiffusion is the a Uniswap v2 fork with Sushi's MinichefV2 implemented for rewards distribution. Diffusion was the first DEX and by far the largest in TVL and volume before the Nomad hack. With stablecoins back on Evmos and incentives to give them a boost, the revitalized team will soon be releasing a new roadmap and their plans to continually improve the DEX.\n\n---\n\n**Meta**\n\nIPFS: https://bafybeiftslqvljku5szkumbeoy3s2fje5j56xio5mwydxpxbnajcvunpwa.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-PS-1.md \nMultisig: [0x35C237Bab19e5B89708f8513b75FF0F07A3c2a09](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0x35C237Bab19e5B89708f8513b75FF0F07A3c2a09) (evmos1xhpr0w43nedcjuy0s5fmwhls7parc2sfs33xef)",0.006865897651472275],["UnknownProposalTypeError\n\nError: UnknownProposalTypeError: ProposalContent can not be decoded for unknown ProposalType.\n\nType URL:\n/evmos.erc20.v1.RegisterCoinProposal",0.004379115414375893],["Community Pool Spend: Recover IBC tokens from Airdrop\n\ndiscussion: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7149-evmos-recover-ibc-tokens-from-airdrop",0.0016666598835752462],["Liquidity Mining Proposal for Axelar Network, Celer Network, and Gravity Bridge on Kinesis\n\nThis proposal incentivizes stablecoin liquidity as bridge from Axelar, Celer, and Gravity Bridge with 99000 Evmos to be linearly distributed over 2 months.

Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis through TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 6th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $7.3M (Peaking at $10M) and 3rd highest 7-day volume of $6.5M. The number of tokens locked in the LP have grown from 700k EVMOS before the incentives started to now just over 2M. Deep & stable liquidity is important for the health of every protocol, and incentives can play a key part in maintaining this liquidity. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring on October 18th, so the community needs to decide the next steps forward.\n\n **Plan of Action**\n\n Based on poll results and community feedback in Discord and Commonwealth, we are asking to extend incentives on Osmosis with another 600k EVMOS over 90 days.

As you might know, some incentivized pools require to bridge assets from Ethereum via Axelar/Gravity to Evmos. Once they are bridged to Evmos, you must convert them (on the [asset page](https://app.evmos.org/assets) of Evmos) from IBC-coins to ERC-20 tokens. This requires a fee of about ~0.3 Evmos. New ecosystem participants won’t own any Evmos at this time, so it is crucial to implement a faucet who funds them. This situation is only temporary, as the team will implement an auto-conversion on protocol level in the near future. Until then, it’s our job to onboard new participants with ease to unleash the full potential of the DeFi revival on Evmos.\n## Architecture \nThe bot will be available on the Discord faucet channel of Evmos. To minimize any gaming of the faucet we will implement a cooldown period, a minimum number of assets that must be deposited on the [asset page](https://app.evmos.org/assets) and further on-chain checks. The bot's wallet will be funded by the multisig on a bi-weekly basis (or if the balance gets close to zero). Furthermore, we might fund additional hot-wallets for faucet purposes.\n## Funds \nOnboarding 20,000 users is a likely scenario thus we ask for 6,000 Evmos to be used for dust.

We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH.Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we’ve hosted 449+ workshops and 18 summits with reach in 19+ countries. With over 32,000+ registrants for our events, we’ve built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, & more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.\n\nWhy Our Proposal Matters:\n\nSince Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there’s a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nDystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming 5 IRL events in 2023:\n\n• ETH Portland (Jan 2023)\n• DeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)\n• ETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)\n• ETH Seattle (July 2023)\n• ETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nWe are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $75k in 2023. This will help cover venue costs, AV, staging, furniture, and food.\nWe expect 300-350 attendees per event and about 800-1000 registrants (Evmos will get the email list). And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we’d love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.\nTo us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.\nIn the past, we’ve had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot’s team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.\nOther sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.\n\n**WHY THE CONFERENCES ARE VALUABLE TO EVMOS:**\n\nBeyond brand recognition and on-site education, the email list is the highest value thing a sponsor can get out of any event. As part of our sponsorship agreement, Evmos would get the email list of all the conference attendees per event. This is a huge value add because the Evmos team can reach out to the attendees (who listened to the Evmos talk IRL) and drive them to more dense educational content (ie. like videos, blog posts, documentation, etc) after the event. They can even use these lists to even create their own event series (if they so wished). Over time, as they participate in more and more events, Evmos will be able to convert people who they met IRL into advocates (simply b/c they are able to reach attendees after the event and to continue pushing them down the funnel). TLDR; registrant lists will be a huge value add for the Evmos community.\n\nWe’re Part Of The Ecosystem:\nOur goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor. We have also not sold ANY of the $EVMOS tokens that we've received. We're in it for the long haul :) In 2022, EVMOS participated in 2 of our events, HackSummit SF & DeFi Bogota. As a summary, here are the key stats for the 2 events Evmos participated in:\n\nFor DeFi Bogota: [(https://2022.defibogota.org/](https://2022.defibogota.org/)\n• 100% free for attendees\n• 2024 registrants (Evmos will get the email list)\n• ~700 attendees\n• 20 speakers\n• 21 sessions\n• 18 talks\n• 1 panel\n• 2 workshops\n• 7 hrs of content\n\nFor Hacksummit SF: [https://sf.hacksummit.org](https://sf.hacksummit.org/)\n• 100% free for attendees\n• 916 registrants (Evmos will get the email list)\n• ~350 attendees\n• 30 sessions\n• 24 talks\n• 1 panel\n• 5 workshops\n• 10 hrs of content",0.09787585254698165],["[ECP-1] Formalizing the Foundational Layer of Evmos DAO Governance\n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Notice:** This proposal submission has been significantly shortened to fit within the proposal word count and accompanying graphical content has been removed - we highly recommend reading the full version on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md).\n\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified Guiding Values. Each proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. After a month of deliberation and productive discussions on Commonwealth, we feel confident to move forward.\n\nThe scope of this vote is to formalize ECP-1, which includes two submodules:\n- ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n- ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework\n---\nThe rest of the following proposals will be presented to the community very shortly:\n\n- ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\n- ECP-3: Empowering the Community with Strategic Growth Initiatives*\n- ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\n---\n**ECP-2A will be submitted for voting later tonight, with ECP-2B to follow within the week.**\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 will be finalized and proposed in Q1 2023, but the proposal drafts are available for preview on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions/2.%20Evmos%20DAO%20Proposals) as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-3.md).**\n\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos core team is becoming harder to manage.\n\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years.\n## ECP-1A: Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework. All community proposals must go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the framework before going on-chain for voting.\n\n**Abstract:** ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAOs Governance system, and provides a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams. The Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.\n## ECP Framework Components\n### 1.

ECP Submission Guidelines\nPlease refer to [Full Proposal >](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md)\n---\n## ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in scaling a DAO and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations. One of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. Please refer to full proposal for our vision for workstreams.\n### 1. Definition and Purpose \nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc). A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community run initiatives.\n### 2. Workstream Requirements \nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered informal. A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the various creation.\n### 3. Workstream Formation Process\n### 4. Workstream Stages\n\n## The Standardized Compensation Framework\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\n**Compensation Principles, Compensation Types, Compensation Eligibility** can be found in the full document.\n\nWhen a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:\n- The role the contributor plays\n- The weekly time commitment \n- The monthly compensation amount \n- Compensation rationale (base and vested) \n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members. This framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO. \n\n## Base Compensation\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n**1 | Value Level** - refers to the contributors expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributors level. Value Level Assessment Matrix - Please refer to the full proposal.\n\n**2 | Commitment Level** - The DAO will cap time full-time commitments to 40 hour work weeks for a total of 160 hours / month. Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders.\n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios: refer to the full proposal.\n\n**3 | Base Rate** - The base rate is currently proposed at $28/hr. The Community may vote to adjust the hourly rate through a governance proposal to account for changes in market conditions and/or treasury reserve levels. \n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**:\n `Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n## Vesting Compensation\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n**1 | Contribution Level** - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members.\n\nRefer to full prop for more details.\n\n**2 | Accountability Level** - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2. \n\nPlease refer to the full proposal to view the accountability level table.\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**:\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\nVesting schedules for all contracts are 4-years.\n\n[Full Proposal >](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md)",0.03410083797442265],["UnknownProposalTypeError\n\nError: UnknownProposalTypeError: ProposalContent can not be decoded for unknown ProposalType.\n\nType URL:\n/evmos.erc20.v1.ToggleTokenConversionProposal",0.0168702298430314],["UnknownProposalTypeError\n\nError: UnknownProposalTypeError: ProposalContent can not be decoded for unknown ProposalType.\n\nType URL:\n/evmos.erc20.v1.RegisterCoinProposal",0.035464905515118016],["UnknownProposalTypeError\n\nError: UnknownProposalTypeError: ProposalContent can not be decoded for unknown ProposalType.\n\nType URL:\n/evmos.erc20.v1.RegisterCoinProposal",0.045054157253415585],["Funding Request - MetaTank\n\n**Project Name:** MetaTank (@MetaTankProject)\n **Designated Multisig Address:** *0x48199AF97AbA9910198E32d34AEc8Fa9528677bD/evmos1fqve47t6h2v3qxvwxtf54my049fgvaaadgppqk* \n **Multisig Members (3 of 4 Multisig):**\n - InstaFinanzas | Stakin Validator\n - Kevin | Oni Validator\n - devd331 | Evmos Community Mod\n - MTNK-Kayz | MetaTank \n \n **Total funds requested:** $120k or 300000 EVMOS @$0.4 \n **Fund Distribution Method:** \n Milestone 1 - $40k or 100000 EVMOS (Conversion Platform, Game Development Pt1).\n Amount released: 33% | Expected duration: 2 months\n Milestone 2 - $30k or 75000 EVMOS (Platform Audit, Game Development Pt2).\n Amount Released: 25% | Expected duration: 1.5 months\n Milestone 3 - $50k or 125000 EVMOS (Game Development Pt3, Marketing, Rewards liquidity pool).\n Amount Released: 42% | Expected duration: Ongoing \n \n **Any previous funding rounds:** No official raises have been conducted.

Focusing on building web2 mobile games (hypercasual genre) and connecting them to web3 via our Conversion Platform. Lore-based games that are stream-friendly (prone to virality) and fun. Users can simply download our games from an app store and play. However, the option exists for users to convert their in-game rewards into on-chain $MTNK tokens on the Evmos blockchain.\n **Important:** We are not a Metaverse, no NFTs are involved, no tokens required to play, and we are not P2E. MetaTank is creating games that are price-independent. Focusing on strategically increasing our IP value through the mass appeal of hypercasual mobile games.\n **Why we are unique:** We are bringing a new method of revenue generation and user acquisition not seen in crypto. Built on quality production and not reliant on marketing hype, token prices or a constant funnel of new users (new capital).\n **Business Model:** MetaTank generates fiat revenue externally via In-App Ads and In-App Purchases. A portion is injected into Evmos to balance the rewards liquidity pool. The remainder is reinvested into game development. Further adding to our library of mobile games which leads to more users and increased recurring revenues.\n **Bringing Value to Evmos:** MetaTank has found a less-exhausting method to onboard web2 users. Only via Evmos can the Conversion Platform be utilized. Users will become natives and have a stake in Evmos’ growth.  They will be holding a portion of their wealth on Evmos. They will support local projects and engage in other activities such as trading, minting, liquidity mining and lending. Long-term stakeholders who will not disappear after a retweet competition or incentive program.\n \n **Initial benefits to Evmos include:** \n - Benefit 1 – Liquidity injected into Evmos from revenues generated externally (Ads/In-app purchases).\n - Benefit 2 – Onboarding web2 users, who must enter Evmos to use our Conversion Platform.\n - Benefit 3 - Onboarding Web2 game developers with already established userbases and IP (compounding Benefit 1 & 2).\n - Benefit 4 – 10% of MetaTank tokens are reserved for the Evmos community.\n - Benefit 5 – Conducting the MetaTank amassed userbase as a marketing platform, promoting Evmos and its ecosystem projects. \n \n This is not a one-time deal. MetaTank wishes to continue its relationship with the Evmos community, sharing in the value generated by its IP. Our materials prove that we are capable and have already built a version of everything we propose.\n **[Proof of capability >](https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1605249619713490944)** \n The mobile gaming industry is experiencing non-stop growth. We can do a lot more with Evmos and show the world of web2 and web3 that there is another way to gaming in crypto.",0.15221056682234055],["Evmos Mainnet v10.0.0 Upgrade\n\n## Description\n\n### Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt, Evmos Core Team\n\n### Software upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos Mainnet software upgrade at block height [9,495,000](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/9495000) from its current version [v9.1.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v9.1.0) to [v10.0.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v10.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n### Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on Testnet and then on Mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n### Impact\n\nOn a high level, the v10.0.0 software includes the following improvements:\n\n- Update Cosmos-SDK to v0.46.7, IBC-Go to v5.2.0 and Ethermint to v0.20.0\n- Automatic conversion of IBC coins to their ERC20 representation upon receiving\n- Support for ERC20 token transfers via IBC\n- ERC20 proposals to register ERC20 tokens and Cosmos coins now can receive multiple denominations\n- Prioritized mempool support for Cosmos and Ethereum txs\n- EIP-1559 support for native Cosmos transactions\n- EIP-712 fixes for all major Cosmos messages (eg: MsgGrant for restake support)\n- Add Ledger support to the evmosd CLI\n- Ethereum Tx indexer\n- The funder for a clawback vesting account can now be updated\n- Introduce minimum commission rate as governance ruled parameter for the staking module (set at 5%)\n- EIP-712 fixes for the vesting module\n- Add a default file store listener for a basic implementation of [ADR-038: State Listening](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/architecture/adr-038-state-listening)\n- Update default node snapshot interval to 5000 seconds\n- Update Ledger supported algorithms to only consist of EthSecp256k1\n\nA full change log can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v10.0.0).\n\nNOTE: Since Cosmos v0.46 it is not possible to include links to Windows binaries in software upgrade proposals anymore.\n\n### Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8501-evmos-software-upgrade-v10).",0.00026812886585469986],["Increase Deposit Amount for Evmos Proposals\n\n## Increase Deposit Amount for Evmos Governance \n  ### Summary \n \n  This passing of this proposal would raise the minimum amount of EVMOS tokens to be deposited for a proposal to reach on-chain voting from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS with the intentions to maintain high quality proposals and prevent spam from going on chain.\n \n ### Abstract\n \n  Proposal Deposit Concept: \n  \n * For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be reach a set deposit of an amount defined by parameters in the governance module before the deposit end time.\n \n  * A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.\n  The proposer account is only required to deposit ~**1 EVMOS**. \n \n  Deposit Refund and Burn Concept: \n \n  * If the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount. \n \n  * If the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4%) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.\n \n  ### Motivation \n \n  Proposal to Increase Deposit Amount: \n \n  By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit requires 192 EVMOS or approximately 60 in USD equivalent. Currently, is a low threshold to help ensure quality proposals and prevent possible spam proposals. Comparing other cosmos governance current deposits, the Cosmos hub requires 250 ATOM or 2,280 USD and Osmosis requires 1600 OSMO or 1,193 USD for proposals to enter the on-chain voting stage. \n \n  With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to 3500 EVMOS or approximately 1,100 in USD equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance. \n \n  ### Important Note: \n \n  Community Members must not be priced out of making proposals on chain. 3500 EVMOS is likely a large enough deposit to deter spam, whilst still being within the reach of most community members to campaign for a deposit, or provide one themselves. \n \n  Multiple wallets may fund any proposal deposit, so this remains within the realm of most Cosmos users to campaign for and crowdsource funding from other community members and validators, where a good proposal may exist, but funding for a deposit is lacking. \n \n  ### Voting \n \n  * By voting YES, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS. \n \n  * By voting NO, you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements. \n \n  * By voting ABSTAIN, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal. \n \n  * By voting NOWITHVETO, expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",0.0071876338984588894],["Ratify Governance-Official Meanings for Yes, No, Abstain and NoWithVeto\n\n## Ratify Governance-Official Meanings for Yes, No, Abstain and NoWithVeto \n \n ### Summary \n \n This proposal aims to put forward a clear definition for the voting options “Yes”, “No”, “Abstain”, and “NoWithVeto” in Evmos governance that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community. These definitions are taken directly from the Evmos docs, and will be further formalized if this proposal passes.  \n \n * Yes: indicates approval of the proposal in its current form. \n * No: indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. \n * Abstain: indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal. \n* NoWithVeto: indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned. \n \n### Abstract \n \n Recently, there have been proposals that have attempted to redefine the meanings of the voting options in a governance process. This is a dangerous precedent to set because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters, which can in turn undermine the will of the voters. To ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the views of the community, it is crucial to clearly define the meanings of the voting options and design the governance process in a way that promotes fairness and effectiveness. \n \n### Motivation \n \nIn Evmos governance a “No” vote is generally understood to mean that the voter is opposed to the proposal and does not want it to be implemented. An “Abstain” vote means that the voter is neutral on the proposal and does not wish to express a position either for or against it. A “No With Veto” vote means the voter is strongly opposed and in most cases will lead to the proposal deposit being burned. \n \n It can be dangerous to add or change meanings to the voting options in a governance process because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters. Additionally, changing meanings to the voting options can undermine the transparency and fairness of the governance process. If voters do not understand the full implications of their votes, they may make decisions that are not in line with their true views or the best interests of the community. This can undermine the legitimacy of the governance process and lead to mistrust and dissatisfaction among the community. \n \nOverall, it is important to clearly define the meanings of the various voting options in a governance process to ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the will of the community. \n \nThe passage of this proposal will ratify following definitions directly from the Evmos docs that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community: \n \n* Yes: indicates approval of the proposal in its current form. \n* No: indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. \n* Abstain: indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal. \n* NoWithVeto: indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned. \n \n ### Voting \n \n* By voting YES, indicates approval of the proposal in its current form to ratify the governance-official meanings of  “Yes”,“No”, “Abstain” and “No With Veto” for governance voting options. \n \n* By voting NO,  indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. \n \n* By voting ABSTAIN, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal. \n \n* By voting NOWITHVETO, indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned. \n",0.03960119724382168],["Increase Developer Revenue from 50% to 95%\n\n### Parameters being changed with this proposal.\n\nIf successful, this proposal will increase the developer_shares parameter in the revenue module from 50% to 95%. The remainder 5% is to prevent spam.\n\n### Motivation\n\n The `x/revenue` module enables Evmos to support splitting transaction fees between validators/delegators and smart contract developers. As a part of the [Evmos Token Model](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b), this mechanism aims to increase the adoption of Evmos by offering a new stable source of income for smart contract developers. Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer account or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees. The **developer_shares** parameter is the percentage of the transaction fees that are sent to the contract deployer.\n\nConsidering the low transaction costs on Evmos the current 50/50 split of EVM tx fees between smart contract developers and validators is insufficient to provide meaningful cash flows for dev teams. An increase to 95% would create more incentives for developers to deploy and register smart contracts on Evmos.\n\nWe acknowledge the fact that this change alone might not be significant to sustain developer teams in the short term and are exploring additional alternatives to continue incentivizing teams to build on Evmos in the mid-term.\n\nIf this proposal passes validators and delegators will earn zero fees for EVM transactions with registered contracts, but will still earn the [commission on staking rewards](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#what-is-the-incentive-to-run-a-validator) and 95% of the fees from other Cosmos transactions (eg: IBC, Staking, etc).\n\nOur goal with this proposal is to attract and retain smart contract developers as they are the backbone of the Evmos ecosystem and to provide a means to generate sustainable revenue for projects.### Impact\n\nRegistered smart contracts will receive 95% of the EVM transaction fees if this proposal passes.\n\nBelow are some calculations that might give a clearer example of what developers can expect:\n - At current Evmos price ($0.40637) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 200,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.00466466 * 200000 txs * 0.95 = $886.29**\n - At Evmos price ($2) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 100,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.01669652 * 100000 txs * 0.95 = $1,586.17**\n - At optimistic Evmos price ($4.50) minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 50,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.03756717 * 50000 txs * 0.95 = $1,784.43**\n\n Gas price calculations were generated with [this](https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evm-gas-prices) calculator. Developers can change the variables to estimate how much revenue their dApps can generate.\n\n### Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8536-revenue-module-change-revenue-to-95)",0.027741104829206182],["Cancellation of Prop 45, Clarification of Laurel Project Role\n\n# Cancellation of Prop 45, Clarification of Laurel Project Role\n\nThis proposal seeks a formal cancellation of Proposal 45, return of funds from the Prop 45 multisig to the Community Pool and a clarification of the role of Loredana and Christian on EVMOS due to recent malicious acts and spam proposals.\n\nThis proposal is unfortunately necessary to submit anonymously, due to Loredana and Christian\\'s legal threats, which were committed to Github two weeks ago: [https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md)\n\nAs such it is important to clarify that this proposal is not being made by the EVMOS Foundation or any of it\\'s representatives, and is being brought forth by a community stakeholder of the EVMOS chain who has been witnessing these events unfold.

At the same time, we are also experiencing some difficulties. The TVL on Diffusion has grown to a height of $7.4M and since Evmos price fell, the TVL has gone down to $2.5M (2023.01.18). During the process, we found 3 issues: first, multiple bridges and liquidity fragmentation; second, mercenary liquidity and reward dumping; and third, the lack of the ecosystem building and Evmos use cases, damaging Evmos’ value. The EVMOS Incentive on Diffusion ended on 2023.01.19.\n\n\n## **Strategy**\n\nWe're trying some new measures to improve Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem.\n\n#### **1. Concentrated Liquidity**\nAlthough Evmos has $2.5M in native liquidity, it is mainly split into 13 trading pairs. We recommend temporarily focusing Evmos Incentive on a single bridge and major trading pairs (ATOM, USDC, wETH, etc.), in order to concentrate the limited liquidity.\nAccording to community's feedbacks, we plan to start from Axelar as the single bridge to concentrate liquidity first. More bridges and assets such as grav.USDT / ceUSDC / stEVMOS (stride) can be added after the effective growth of liquidity.\n\n#### **2. LP Bonding**\nTo incentivize long-term liquidity providers and to avoid the adverse effects of mercenary liquidity, SpaceFi Farm supports LP Bonding, including no bonding, 7 days unbonding and 14 days unbonding. The longer the LP is locked in the farm, the higher the APR will be.\n\n#### **3. Ecosystem Building**\nEvmos Liquidity Incentive is a short-term booster. And the thriving ecosystem projects are the long-term value. SpaceFi has been actively helping new projects get started in Evmos through Incubation and [Launchpad Program](https://twitter.com/spacefi_io/status/1584913982036803594). We've incubated [Soul Network](https://thesoul.network), a cross-chain DID network Cosmos & Ethereum, and also the First Place Winner in the Web3 track of Evmos Hackathon.\n\n\n## **Action Plan**\n\nAccording to the community's feedbacks, we plan to apply for 1M EVMOS as the liquidity incentive to start, in a program lasting 90 days, and expect to bring $4-$8M native liquidity with ARP 37% (no bonding) - 73% (14 days unbonding), similar to it on Osmosis. The above is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18. If the liquidity grows well, we may apply to increase the incentive for the further growth.\n\n\n#### **1. Why Liquidity Incentive**\nEvmos native liquidity is still very small and further improvement of liquidity is a priority. In fact, 1M EVMOS is about 2 days' inflationary rewards of Evmos delegating. The value brought by the Liquidity Incentive will exceed the reward itself.\n\nThis proposal is not only about Liquidity Incentive, but also about an ecosystem project SpaceFi's whole launching. We hope to bring more use cases for Evmos and more confidence to the ecosystem and community through SpaceFi's performance.\n\n\n#### **2. Use xEVMOS as the reward, not EVMOS directly**\nThe [xEVMOS module](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8598-preproposal-new-evmos-liquidity-incentive-and-spacefi-whole-launching) is aimed to incentivize long-term holders and reduce reward dumping.\n\nWe‘ll launch a non-tradable reward token, xEVMOS, converted 1:1 from the EVMOS requested.\nxEVMOS earned from liquidity incentive can be converted back to EVMOS with a 30 days unbonding period. Users can also choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately, which will only convert back to 50% in EVMOS. The other 50% will be transferred back to the multisig address of requested EVMOS, which can make the incentive program last longer.\n\nWith xEVMOS, we can reduce reward spending and dumping while maintaining an attractive APR and incentivizing long-term holders. The liquidity incentive can last more than 90 days if some users choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately. We can also offer xEVMOS module as a public good for other incentive programs in Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n#### **3.

We want to make it an engine in the ecosystem with DEX+NFT+Spacebase+Launchpad, not just a DEX. At the same time as the EVMOS Liquidity Incentive begins, we will fully launch the SpaceFi product and SPACE token.\n\n\nThe initial emission of SPACE token will be about 125000 SPACE / day, 70% of which will be used for farming rewards, i.e. 87500 SPACE / day. We will allocate 2/3 of the SPACE farming reward to EVMOS Liquidity Incentive, i.e. 58350 SPACE / day. The remaining 1/3 will be allocated to SPACE & Planet NFT staking and other liquidity incentives.\n\n\nSpace Swap and Planet NFT are already live on Evmos mainnet.\n[Space Swap](https://swap-evmos.spacefi.io/#/swap) has been running on Evmos since May 2022 to date, with more than 2,000 early adopters providing liquidity on it.

Allocated funds are to be kept in the Multisig controlled by the Evmos community and distributed only when needed by Encode via multisig composed of trusted community advisory members. Encode's monthly expenses for running the program will be $50k, which can be considered as part of the total requested grants amount as per the community's preference.\n\n• Encode Club is a web3 education community. We help people learn, build and launch their web3 careers. We do this through high quality events such as educate series, hackathons, accelerators and bootcamps.\n\n•Encode Club will organize a pilot grants program for the Evmos community for H1 2023 (Jan to July). Their team will be entrusted with their promotion and furthermore tasked with evaluation of the best projects submissions, making sure that each is up to the standards set by the community.\n\n•Regular community calls shall be established and kept open to both the community and the DAO, which are to be used for questions, feedback and general updates about the program's progress. Additionally, 3 special check-in calls will be scheduled and executed throughout the program - one following the successful setup of the grants program, one midway through and one at the very end, the purpose of which is for Encode to provide further insight regarding grant applications and subsequently grantees.\n\n**Multisig Address**: 0x525C1cd42CBca9878bb3bF96DB269EDfc2F10db5\n\n**Multisig Committee (4/7)**:\n\n•   Lit | Notional Lab\n\n•   GV | Swiss Staking\n\n•   Luisqa | Zenith Station\n\n•   Outcast | Legion Nodes\n\n•   Sigmund | Quelabs\n\n•   Bosco | Silknodes\n\n•   Ömer | Alkadeta\n\n ## Abstract\n\n Establishing an effective grants program is important to champion the growth and development of the Evmos ecosystem because it provides support for projects and initiatives that align with the ecosystem's goals and objectives. This funding can be used to help new protocols launch, research and development, infrastructure, community building, public goods, and other activities that contribute to the growth and success of the ecosystem. Additionally, a grants program can attract and retain talented individuals and organizations to Evmos, as well as increase collaboration and partnerships within the community. Overall, an effective grants program can play a key role in driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and promoting the long-term sustainability of the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nEncode is one of the most trusted and well known companies within the web3 space, known for delivery of top tier program in partnership with the biggest names in the industry. Over the past two years their team has managed to successfully execute more than 90 events (both online and in-person).\n\n## Motivation\n\nEncode Club’s core goal has always been to deliver top tier programs that aid enthusiasts, developers and projects alike in growing, achieving their goals and pushing the web3 space forward. Evmos is a young and blooming ecosystem, and similar to others at this stage of their growth - it is in need of builders that would keep pushing it further and raise the bar higher.\n\nBy leveraging the curiosity, knowledge and dedication of their 50,000+ strong developer community, Encode Club can foster high levels of engagement and building for the Evmos ecosystem. Coupled with their past experience of running Saddle’s successful grants program and already having led an Evmos Hackathon through Covelant, their track record proves they are more than capable of successfully executing a program of this magnitude.\n\nFlawless execution of great events is often considered the end result of Encode Club’s efforts. In reality, however, these events are the means by which the true output and contribution to the web3 space is being achieved - identifying talent.\n\nEncode Club is a talent powerhouse.Their community consists of some of the brightest minds of tomorrow - actively participating in a wide variety of events, engaging with different technologies and most importantly - building.\n\n## Proposal\n\nEncode Club will dedicate 8-10 people from their team to deliver an exclusive pilot grants program that will run for the duration of the first half of 2023 with the option of extending it until the end of the year. Their team will be responsible for handling each and every phase of the project including, but not limited to planning, promoting, sourcing, executing and judging.\n\nThe Evmos community and team are to be an integral part, functioning as a guiding power and influencing the general direction of the program that the Encode team shall pursue in order to accomplish the objectives outlined by the community and Evmos Core Team.\n\nEncode is to be allocated $2.5MM for the duration of the grants program. The amount will be kept within a multisig, with distributions approved and executed by the Evmos committee multisig in the form of rewards.Their recipients are to be the best developers and projects picked by Encode for fulfilling the prerequisites and goals outlined by the program.\n\nEncode Club will crowdsource ideas for bounties from the community and will decide what bounty size to allocate for each. Each of the bounties should consist of:\n\n•   Brief summary and explanation\n\n•   Clearly outlined deliverables\n\n•   Execution and delivery within the timeline of the program\n\n•   Amount of funding attached\n\nThere will be two types of bounties:\n\n•   Competitions – several projects compete and the best gets the bounty award at the end of the program.\n\n•   Award – a single team is selected to answer the bounty, and receives the award upon completion by the end of the program.\n\nBounties will be listed on the Encode website and public calls for participants will be made. Encode Club will take care of promoting and marketing the initiative as well as organize several education events with community members and investors from the Evmos community throughout the bounty period.\n\nTeams then engage in working, building and polishing their projects by the deadline outlined in the program. The best are to be invited, judged and rewarded in proportion to their efforts and magnitude of impact for the Evmos ecosystem in a show and tell finale events organized by Encode.\n\nIn order to ensure transparency and accountability on Encode Club’s side an Evmos Multisig Committee with representatives from both the community will be in direct communication with Encode and will have power to challenge their decisions along the way. The multisig will be overseeing the funds allocation and provide an additional layer of security for Evmos community. Any remaining funds at the end of the initial grants program period will be rolled into future funding upon approval, or returned to the community pool if the community decides not to renew the program.\n\n**Cost Breakdown**:\n\nEncode is a 25 person team and will be putting significant effort across multiple departments and individuals. The following is a rough outline of the costs associated with the proper execution of the grants pilot program:\n\n•   Marketing and Sourcing: $10k per month (on average 2 people)\n\n•   Program Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)\n\n•   Grant Team Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)\n\n•   Book-keeping, Finances + Admin: $2.5k per month (on average 1 person)\n\n•   Hiring support for any grantees: $5k per month (on average 1 person)\n\n•   Tech and Infrastructure: $2.5k per month\n\nThis brings the total monthly cost of running the program to $50k. The amount is to be invoiced in advance prior every month and deducted from the total grant size allocated for the program execution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf successful, Encode will be able to start executing as early as mid/late February. Gathering bounty proposals from both the community and the Evmos team will begin immediately after approval.The marketing team will switch focus on promoting the grant program, while also turning the attention of Encode’s existing Cosmos and Evmos hackers within the community to the upcoming events.\n\nGrant applicants will work closely with Encode Club’s program managers throughout the duration of the program in order to ensure that their work follows the guidelines and meets the requirements outlined by the bounties in order to qualify for a grant. Encode will impose deadlines for project submissions, after which the best builders will be invited to present their work live and compete for a prize from the grants pool.\n\nFor more supporting details and dicussion, please reference the [Commonwealth Post](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8549-encode-clubs-evmos-grants-proposal).\n\n**Voting**\n\n•   By voting **YES**, indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\n\n•   By voting **NO**, indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n\n•   By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\n•   By voting **NOWITHVETO**, indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.",0.033502282490154],["Evmos x Covalent Hackathon Participant Rewards Re-Adjustment\n\n## Author(s)\n- LPX, Evmos DAO \n- Leibing, Covalent\n\n## Summary\n\nDue to the decrease in the price of EVMOS, there is a deficit in the amount of tokens that were originally asked from the pool from [Proposal 54](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/54) and the amount that is needed to pay out all the rewards from the hackathon. It is our belief that it is paramount for the hackathon winners to be rewarded for contributions and efforts in a timely manner to encourage the continued interest and growth of the developer community in the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n- [Commonwealth Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/9429-time-sensitive-evmos-x-covalent-hackathon-payouts-readjustment)\n- [Hackathon Page and Winners](https://www.encode.club/evmoscovalent-hack)\n\n## Abstract\n\n- The Covalent x Encode x Evmos Community hackathon concluded last month with participants joining from around the world.\n- At the time of the passing of Proposal 54, EVMOS was around $2.50. Currently, the price of EVMOS is ~$0.475.\n- This proposal is requesting funds from the Community Pool to balance the rewards payable to current market price as promised in Proposal 54. The total amount requested can be found in the Amount Requested section below.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe #OneMillionWallets hackathon was a successful event that brought together members of the Ethereum as well as Evmos Community to work on exciting projects. However, the price of the EVMOS token has dropped significantly since the hackathon was funded by Proposal #54, resulting in a deficit that needs to be filled in order to pay out the participants.\n\nThis proposal aims to ensure that the hard work and effort put in by the participants is rewarded, and that the Evmos Community continues to be a supportive and collaborative space for innovation. Additionally, this proposal will demonstrate Evmos commitment to its Community and show that it keeps its promises.\n\nThe original proposal clearly stated the following: 'The amount of tokens for the hackathon prizes of $100k will be determined at time of dispersement. In the case of extreme price volatility, the Governance workstream will assist in readjusting the community pool funding request.'\n\n## Message from Covalent\n\nThank you for your patience in staying with us and navigating this situation together. The Evmos-Covalent #OneMillionWallets hackathon concluded in December 2022 to great success, where we saw more than 500+ teams registering, more than 60+ projects built, and more than 100 daily quiz participants. It was our biggest and most successful #OMW hackathon to date.\n\nDue to the depreciation of the prize pool, however, we cannot give the winners what we feel they truly deserve. We know how important runway is for teams building in an ecosystem; such runway can only be achieved when the teams are rewarded at the amount after the price movements have been adjusted. We deeply appreciate the EvmosDAO Governance workstream's efforts in readjusting the community pool fund to ensure that projects get the deserved level of funding.\n\n- Leibing, DevRel, Covalent\n\n## Amount Requested\n\nThe amount requested pegs the EVMOS price to $0.40 due to market uncertainty. All leftover EVMOS will be returned to the community pool.\n\nThe total amount of rewards payable came out to be $60,950 instead of the planned $100K. 50% of the funds in the original multisig that were originally allocated for the hackathon rewards, or 50,200 EVMOS (~$20,080) will be used to help fill this deficit.\n\n- $40,870 ($60,950 - $20,080) for the deficit in the amount of the hackathon winners' rewards (~102,175 EVMOS tokens @ 0.40). [Detailed sheet.](https://evmos.community/covalent-hackathon)\n- $17,799 for the organizers of the hackathon (~44,497.5 EVMOS tokens @ 0.40)\n- 20,000 EVMOS tokens for a donor that tried to assist in filling the deficit ([TX](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/txs/001094A2EECF02AD8739030656BCECE936F8BECABCD4A6B6FD0FF2166ECF8096))\n- **Grand Total: $58,669 + 20,000 EVMOS (roughly 166.6K EVMOS)**\n\nNote: This funding request is specifically for the outstanding amount required to pay out the participants and organizers of the hackathon. The 50% that was initially allocated to Covalent for their services will be released to Covalent - there are no plans to re-adjust the indexing and API integration fees at the moment. The decision to delay the staking of the other 50% by Covalent was not the responsibility of the Evmos Community.\n\nRemaining tokens, assuming that the Evmos token price holds above $0.40 will be sent back to the Community Pool.\n",0.02383325290243073],["Evmos Mainnet v11.0.0 Upgrade\n\n## Author\n\nFreddy Caceres, Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos software upgrade at block height 10561414 (https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/10561414) (around 4pm UTC Thu., 2nd Feb. 2023) from its current version [v10.0.1](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v10.0.1) to [v11.0.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v11.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nEvmos v11.0.0 contains the following changes and enhcements:\n\n- Add ICA host functionality to enable liquid staking support via Liquid Staking Zones (e.g Stride and Quicksilver)\n- Add distribution logic for incentivized testnet rewards\n- Implement daily instead of annual recalculation of minted coins during inflation\n- Update implementation of module parameters after [deprecation of x/params module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/modules/params/)\n- Migration of IBC transfer escrow accounts to the 'ModuleAccount' type\n- Update IBC-Go to v6.1.0 and Ethermint to v0.21.0\n- Add missing store keys in the inflation module\n- Store evm params under a single key for performance optimization\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v11.0.0).\n\nNOTE: Starting with Cosmos SDK v0.46 it is not possible to include links to Windows binaries in software upgrade proposals anymore.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.\nOn top of the upgrade tests, the Evmos team runs performance tests to monitor the impact of new versions.",0.000301172175713386],["[ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream (Rev. 2)\n\n# ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Workstream (Rev. 2)\n\n## Authors \n- LPX | Evmos DAO\n- GV | Evmos DAO \n- Benny Lava | Evmos DAO\n\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO ([Proposal #51](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51)), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past eight months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.\n\nThis proposal applies all rules defined and approved by the community in ECP-1 ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)). An [FAQ page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/faq.md) has been created and will kept up to date with important questions asked by the Community.\n\n## Preface \n\nFollowing the rejection of Proposal 86, we have conducted a thorough review of the initial proposal and the valuable feedback provided by the Evmos community and validators. This revised proposal was created with objectives to address issues and concerns raised by the community while remaining aligned with the Governance Workstream's Mission, Vision, and Values. We are confident that this revised proposal achieves this goal.\n\nAddressed issues from Proposal 86:\n\n- The total token request has been significantly [reduced by 80% in this proposal](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).\n- R&D, Ecosystem Bootstrap, and Treasury Diversification funds have been excluded in order to facilitate a more targeted dialogue with the community regarding these initiatives and potential funding.\n- The retroactive payment request has been decreased by 64% ($750/mo per contributor).\n- Additional cost-saving measures include the elimination of 2 future workstream contributors and the request for only the first year of vesting emissions for existing members.\n\n## Abstract\n\n### The Governance Workstream's Mandate\n\nThe Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\n- Duties, Responsibilities, Deliverables of the Governance Workstream: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/duties.md)\n\n### Contributions to Evmos\n\nThe Governance Workstream's wide array of contributions and community service for the past half-year range from simple proposal guidance for projects to both native and external liquidity programs responsible for the movement of tens of millions of dollars. \n\n- List of Achievements and Progress Report: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/report.md)\n\n### Progressive Decentralization \n\nWe also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.\n\nWhile we have ambitious plans to create an ecosystem of community owned liquidity and a democratized spending of liquid funds, we have removed all funding requests related to these initiatives for various reasons - separate proposals will be made for these initiatives when we are better prepared to present them.\n\n## Funding Request\n\nThis 6-month funding proposal has been pegged to the price of $0.40 / EVMOS. The total funding amount was reduced by ~80% to the previous proposal and represents now 0.81% of the community pool. The dollar amount requested at current price was also reduced from $2.37mil to $380K. For a breakdown of the ask reduction, please [refer to this page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).\n\n**Contributor Compensations**\n\nThe funding ask includes the base, retro, and vesting pay for 3 existing Governance workstream members as well as the onboarding of three more members, for a total of 6 Governance workstream members.\n- A detailed outline of contributor compensation: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/contributors.md)\n\n**Total:** 950,000 EVMOS\n\n### Fund Disbursements\n\nThis funding proposal will kick off the \"DAO Treasury\" which is managed by 3 Governance members and 5 Validators in a `5-8` Gnosis Safe configuration.

More than 3,000 projects from the DoraHacks community have received over $30 million in grants and hackathon prizes. DoraHacks.io has around 250,000 active users worldwide. The platform offers hackathons, bounties, quadratic funding, privacy voting, and other community governance/funding toolkits. In addition, over 80 major Web3 ecosystems are currently using Dora infrastructures to fund their open-source communities\n\nThe Evmos Hackathon Partnership aims to align all stakeholders by incentivizing individuals and organizations to explore and develop their ideas on Evmos by offering individuals and organizations non-dilutive funding to develop and further the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n### Proposal\n\n **Goal:**\n\n**1. Branding**\n\n• To leverage DoraHacks’ developer community and DoraHacks.io platform’s traffic to promote Evmos’ dev toolkits and APIs, and onboard more developers to adopt Evmos’s tech stacks and build on Evmos\n\n• To leverage DoraHacks’ expertise in organizing hackathons, virtual or in-person hackathons, workshops, and project demo sessions to help the Evmos team operate developer events globally.\n\n• To involve Evmos in the hackathons, quadratic funding community grants and other events DoraHacks co-host with different open Web3 ecosystems, for instance, BNB Chain, Solana, Filecoin, Avalanche, Moonriver, Polygon, Harmony and more.\n\n**2.

We believe that Evmos can become market competitive in terms of liquidity and user experience. \n\n- No investment token \n- No initial swap fees \n- Not profit oriented\n- UniV3 functionalities (concentrated liquidity)\n- Integrated IBC asset and continous development guaranteed\n\nIf this proposal passes, we will ship a V3 DEX deployment in the shortest amount of time. The OA team will handle the engineering side, while the responsibilities of socials management, proposals for incentives and incentives management would be handled by the EvmosDAO.\n\nThe requested funds is for the Orbital Apes team only since the Evmos DAO is already fully funded. Funding is requested as this DEX will be built as public good for Evmos and will not have any funding coming from token sales or protocol fees.\n\n*Notes: This can be seen as an alternative to the ICHI proposal. We believe that we can ship a more feature rich DEX at **much lower costs**. To our knowledge, UniV3 is not adding new chains any time soon due to legal reasons.*\n\n\n## Goal\nCreate a capital efficient AMM to grow native liquidity on Evmos. This will be achieved with the help of EvmosDAO by creating cross-chain proposals for co-incentives (Evmos and Partnering chain) to LP providers and cross-chain token swaps to create protocol-owned liquidity managed by EvmosDAO.\n\n## Deployment Path of UniV3 Fork\n\n- Engineer custom V3 DEX frontend with IBC<>ERC20 conversion\n- Fork UniV3 and deploy modified contracts (no protocol fees, no investement token) in April\n- Bridge integration  \n- Keplr integration (third party dependency)\n\n### Benefits  \n**1 - Liquidity**\nThe Evmos DAO team will be making proposals on other IBC chains to incentivize this DEX along with supplemented Evmos incentives.Protocol owned liquidty would work along side this as well. This will allow Evmos to build more native liquidity and force wider users to IBC tokens into Evmos. After this more DeFi protocols can be built once on chain liquidity is established.\n\n**2 - Time to market**\nWe are market ready within two months. Targetting testnet before April and mainnet once the UniV3 license expires. \n*Side note: The whole cosmos ecosystem is moving towards LSD's. V3 positions are much more tuned for these pools then traditional Dex's. V3 is may more profitable for LP's and provides a much stronger peg between something like stAtom/Atom. If we wait 5 months instead of 2 months we could potentially lose a large chunk of this liquidity to other protocols.*\n\n**3 - Keplr integration**\nIn the near future Keplr is going to have full EVM compatibiltiy. The users will be able to interact with Keplr and Metamask on the DEX.\n\n- [ERC20 Support](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/pull/531)\n- [Tx Signing Support](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/pull/483)\n- Contracts signing: Once contracts signing is integrated by Keplr the OA will merge it into the DEX.\n\n**4 - IBC conversion page**\nSimilar to https://app.evmos.org/assets, this will provide a user friendly interface and reduce complexity of onboarding cosmos based users. A bridge section will be added to deposit/withdraw from multiple EVM chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and many more through Satellite (Axelar). \n\n**5 - No Protocol Fees** \nTraditional decentralized exchanges charge a fee on every swap that flows directly to the protocol or token holders. Initially this will be set to zero, any changes of the fee structure must be approved by the Evmos governance in form of a text proposal. LP fees will still be charged and distributed on swaps to LP providers.\n\n**6 - No Investment Token**\nThe community owned DEX will not have a corresponding governance token. As a community owned project built by OA/EvmosDAO future major developments will be funded through seperate funding requests or grants programs/boutnies. Incentives for liquidity will come in the form of Evmos incentives proposals and Cross-Chain incentives proposals.\n\n\n**7 - Future Development: All the upcoming Evmos/Cross-Chain innovation**\n- New innovation like ICA and ICQ will be actively explored and integrated the best possible way to stay competitive. Such integration would require a seperate funding request.\n- Explore and integrate cross-chain bridge swaps through services such as LiFi.\n\n\n## Milestones\n\n- Deploy the AMM V3 (Contracts/Frontend/Backend) to the Evmos Testnet | Funds realesed: 40% two weeks after testnet \n- Deploy the AMM V3 (Contracts/Frontend/Backend) to the Evmos Mainnet | Funds realesed: 40% two weeks after mainnet \n- IBC conversion page integration | Funds realesed: 10% after functional integration \n- Keplr integration | Funds realesed: 10% after functional integration \n\n\n## Funding Amount\nThis funding proposal will kick off the development for V3.

Demand for carbon credits is expected to become a $500 billion + industry by 2030, and is already a 6 billion annual industry. The race is on!\n\nSome of the major Ethereum (VM) compatible blockchains, such as Polygon, offset their carbon emission by retiring $400,000 in carbon credits (104,794 tonnes) on KlimaDAO, a Polygon based ReFi market. The decision came after [Polygon’s $20 Million pledge](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-is-going-carbon-negative-in-2022-with-a-20-million-pledge) to become carbon negative in 2022.\n\nCelo, another EVM chain, went a step further and is not only [carbon negative from the get-go](https://blog.celo.org/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490), but it is increasingly becoming the EVM-hub for ReFi by actively investing in projects and collaborating with existing players such as Toucan Protocol on Polygon and Regen Network on Cosmos.\n\nAs a first step to kickstart ReFi on Evmos, we are inviting the Evmos protocol to become a part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative and to offset its carbon emission on the Regen Network for 2022. Evmos has its roots in Cosmos (Cosmos Hub prop 44) and this would demonstrate to all stakeholders in the space that strong alliances within the Cosmos ecosystem are possible.\n\nCosmos ZERO, a partnership of Regen Network and the Interchain Foundation, is an initiative for Cosmos protocols and validators to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for their network validator node infrastructure and operations.\n\n## [Cosmos ZERO Program](https://regennetwork.notion.site/Cosmos-ZERO-Achieve-Protocol-Validator-Net-Zero-Carbon-Emissions-ddd441e3ff3d4dbda83265433843ec10) \n## What are some of the potential synergies between Evmos & Regen that could be addressed in future proposals? \n- Add $EVMOS to the allowed currency list for Regen Network\n- Bring NCTs and CFCs as ERC-20 to Evmos\n- Launch $EVMOS/$NCT & $REGEN/$NCT pools on Evmos dexes\n- Help the Evmos validator set to improve the climate impact of their node infrastructure and thereby reduce the carbon footprint\n\nRegen is providing knowledge and resources to enable ReFi on Evmos. Regen also helped Evmos to push ReFi projects such as Gitcoin, supporting this on the Gitcoin end for many years. Offsetting on Regen is just a first step in this mutual partnership. \n\n## Voting \n- Voting YES indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\n- Voting NO indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n- Voting ABSTAIN indicates you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n- Voting NOWITHVETO indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes exceeds a third of the total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.",0.23804980944855858],["UnknownProposalTypeError\n\nError: UnknownProposalTypeError: ProposalContent can not be decoded for unknown ProposalType.\n\nType URL:\n/evmos.erc20.v1.ToggleTokenConversionProposal",0.023754716364520274],["Evmos Mainnet v12.1.0 Upgrade\n\n## Description\n\n### Author\n\nAustin Chandra, Evmos Core Team\n\n### Software upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [12303000](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/12303000) (around 4pm UTC Fri., 31st Mar. 2023) from its current version [v11.0.2](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v11.0.2) to [v12.1.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v12.1.0). This proposal has a voting time of 120 hours.\n\n### Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validate/upgrades).\n\n### Impact\n\nEvmos v12.1.0 contains the following changes and enhancements:\n\n- Enable basic implementation of Fee Subscription to pay for transaction fees with unclaimed staking rewards\n- Support multiple message schemas with EIP-712\n- Remove Ethermint dependency by migrating relevant logic to the Evmos codebase to allow for quicker development iteration\n- Restrict EVM module to work only with Evmos chain\n- Upgrade Tendermint to [v0.34.26](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.26) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.46.10](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.10)\n- Grant full amount of airdropped tokens to users affected by an airdrop [early decay bug](https://github.com/evmos/decay-analysis)\n- Many small improvements and refactors\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v12.1.0).\n\n### Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.\nOn top of the upgrade tests, the Evmos team runs performance tests to monitor the impact of new versions.\n\n### Discussion\nPlease follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/10557-evmos-network-upgrade-to-v1210).",0.00737589283254092],["Treasury stEVMOS/EVMOS Liquidity Pool on Forge\n\n## Author\n\n- Evmos DAO [Telegram](t.me/evmosdao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO)\n- Forge [Telegram](t.me/forgedex), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to provide liquidity of the Evmos treasury to the stEVMOS/EVMOS pair. We request 2M Evmos, with 1M Evmos allocated for liquid staking. All funds will be added to the Forge stEVMOS/EVMOS liquidity pool (~600k USD). It will be actively managed by the DAO, OA + two trusted and active community members. \n\n## Abstract\n\nThis initiative is designed to enhance the growth and long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. \n\nIt involves requesting 2M Evmos from the Evmos treasury and staking 1M Evmos in the liquid staking module of Stride. The DAO will then allocate 1M stEVMOS and 1M EVMOS to the Forge liquidity pool. This will improve the liquid staked token liquidity of Evmos in the market, and the allocation will be monitored and adjusted based on market conditions and community input.\n\nRewards Distribution and DAO Sustainability is another key initiative. The rewards generated from liquid staking and the Forge liquidity pool (LP fees) will be directed to the multisig wallet. A portion of the rewards will be used to cover the operational costs of the DEX to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. This includes development, maintenance, moderation, promotion, marketing, legal and compliance duties. As of today we have monthly costs of roughly ~1k USD (graph service, quote api). The remaining rewards will be allocated for Forge bounties. Bounties are a common way for decentralized exchanges to incentivize developers and security researchers to contribute to the platform. Here are some potential bounties: \n\n- Feature bounties: A feature bounty program incentivizes developers to contribute new features or improvements to the platform's codebase.\n- Education bounties: An education bounty program incentivizes users to create educational content about the platform, such as blog posts, videos, or tutorials.\n- Bug bounties: A bug bounty program rewards security researchers for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities or bugs in the platform's codebase.\n\nWe value transparency and accountability in all aspects of our operations, including our bounty programs. As part of our commitment to transparency, we will provide quarterly reports detailing the bounties we have offered and the costs associated with Forge.\n\nTo ensure the security and integrity of staked funds and community assets, Univ3 liquidity pools will be utilized, which have a proven track record of security and reliability on Ethereum. Acknowledging the potential risks associated with the liquid staking provider Stride, which has undergone multiple audits and implemented IBC limits to minimize vulnerabilities. As a comparison, the ATOM accelerator program also liquid staked around 60k ATOM (~600k USD) by using Stride. **Additionally, Stride has partnered with Forge and committed to incentivize pools on Forge with their own governance tokens.** \n\nBy implementing this proposal, the Evmos community can expect improved utility and value from the treasury funds, increased market liquidity, and a more sustainable DAO and Forge DEX model. A LSD pool by the treasury, along with the security measures in place, will contribute to the overall growth and success of the Evmos ecosystem. \n\n## Stride\n\nThe Stride DAO will be providing incentives as soon as technically possible. If the community provides treasury liquidity of stEVMOS/EVMOS it allows stride to incentivize different pools (like stEVMOS/USDC) instead which brings more external TVL into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n## Timeframe\n\nAfter careful consideration and discussion, the general agreement is to pool these funds into a liquidity pool for a period of 6 months. A follow up proposal will be made to renew after the specified period. If the renewal is rejected, the 2M Evmos will be returned. The requested funds only provision liquidity to Forge. \n\nSide note: If a vault provider that is trusted deploys on Evmos, it could be worth considering entrusting the management of the LP position to the vault.\n\n## About Forge\n\nThe Evmos DAO and OA teamed up and delivered a fully UniV3 compatible DEX on Evmos. Forge is fully community owned and funded. \n\nWhat we offer is: \n\n- No investment token\n- No initial protocol fees\n- Not profit oriented\n- UniV3 functionalities (concentrated liquidity)\n- Integrated IBC asset (coming soon)\n- One click liquid staking button (coming soon)\n\n[See full proposal here](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/113)\n\n## Multisig 4/6\n\nThe position must be adjusted on a regular basis because stEVMOS accrues value against EVMOS daily. Therefore, it is important to keep the multisig simple and effective. \n\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- 0xCtrlAltApe | Orbital Apes\n- Luisqa | Zenith Station\n- Silk Nodes\n- LPX | DAO\n- GV | DAO",0.02348850303528664],["Actionable analytics, management, and Incentives tools for liquidity providers by Revert Finance\n\n# Actionable analytics, management, and Incentives tools for liquidity providers by Revert Finance\n\n## Authors\n\n- Evmos DAO ([Telegram](https://t.me/evmosdao),  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO))\n- Forge ([Telegram](http://t.me/forgedex),  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex))\n- Mario | Revert Finance  ([Website](https://revert.finance/)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/revertfinance))\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Forge team recognizes the valuable tools and resources for v3 that Revert Finance would bring to the Evmos ecosystem and have been in talks for deployment. This proposal aims to formalize the partnership and commitment to deploy, which will also allow the start of the incentives programs on Forge through their unique time-vested [incentives contracts](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q).\n\n## Introduction to Revert Finance\n\nRevert Finance is a well-known protocol in the DeFi landscape for their unparalleled tools, data and analytics, and resources to optimize Univ3 liquidity positions, empowering users to make the most of their liquidity. Valuable analytics such as a position’s PNL, ROI, impermanent loss, historical data, amount invested, etc., provides great insights that are easily understood by users.\n\nRevert has a solid track record, with successful collaborations with Uniswap deployments on other networks, such as [Polygon](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/_FfxBuW7iNwyJZuM796J3rHzRQ4wOYdAck3nWqqcoIE) and [Optimism](https:/mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/9GC9GWqygz-naejNxHueFZSH3RXCltqZ9BT_4LsWsWg). \n\nWe encourage everyone to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O61msPF5MYw) to learn more and get detailed insights on Revert’s tools. \n\n## Tools\n\n**Position Analytics:** Check and easily track the performance of your positions on Forge. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/position-analytics/uniswap-v3-positions).\n\n**Top positions:** The Top Positions section shows a list of the top active positions based on how they are performing overall on Evmos. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/top-positions).\n\n**Incentives:** Revert has an incentives section that displays the currently running incentives programs on the Uniswap v3 canonical staker contract, as well as the time-vested staker contract. Uniswap v3 position dashboards automatically detect and display the rewards accrued by each position. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/liquidity-incentives/time-vested-v3-staker).\n\n**Initiator:** The initiator helps users *initiate* LP positions. Opening positions on concentrated liquidity AMMs requires making important decisions about price ranges, which can be greatly aided with historical data and analysis. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/initiator/start-providing-liquidity).\n\n**Auto-compounding:** The Revert auto-compounder allows LPs to automate the compounding of the accrued fees in exchange for a fixed percentage of the compounded fees. This serves to incentivize a maximum number of compounds at optimal times with regards to gas costs. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/auto-compounder).\n\n**Position Management:** The position management interface is available from the account and position pages, where LPs can Add or Withdraw Liquidity and Claim Fees. Within this interface, you can also swap tokens to align with your desired ratio when adding liquidity, withdrawing, or claiming!\n\n## Milestones and Deliverables\n\nDeliverables refer to the tangible or intangible items that are completed by Revert Finance. These deliverables are grouped together into milestones. The team at Revert Finance has set a target of completing all the deliverables within ~8 weeks, with the goal of demonstrating a long-term commitment to the project. Milestone 1 is prioritized by Revert to help with the roll out of Forge incentives. The project start date is May 1st. \n\n**Milestone 1 - Incentive Tools [25% release 1 months after completion]**\n\n- Vested v3staker contract: Deployment of the vested v3 staker contract on EVMOS\n- Vested v3staker frontend: allowing anyone to stake positions and the creation of incentive programs for Forge pools.\n\n**Milestone 2 - Analytics and Indexing** **[25% release 2 months after completion]**\n\n- Analytics for existing positions: LPs are able to track PNL, APR, Fees etc for their positions\n- Indexing of top positions: Users are able to browse and explore the catalog of existing positions across Forge pools\n\n**Milestone 3- Position Management and Auto-compounder [25% release 3 months after completion]**\n\n- Initiator / backtester for Forge pools: Users are able to backtest and create new positions using the revert interface\n- v3utils contract and frontend: Utilities for LPs, swap and mint, move ranges, etc..\n- Auto-compounder: Deployment and support for the auto-compounder contract and protocol including auto-compounding bots\n\n**Milestone 4 - Keplr integration [25% release 4 months after completion]**\n\n- Integration of Keplr wallet\n\n## Revenue Module\n\nThe contracts that are deployed in Milestone 1 (vested v3staker contracts, i.e. pool incentives) will be registered on the [x/revenue module](https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/modules/revenue) with the Forge Community Multisig Safe as the `WithdrawerAddress`.\n\nThis will demonstrate Revert’s commitment and alignment with Forge’s core concept of being community owned, assist in the long-term goal of becoming a self-sustainable public good of Evmos, and shows good faith in Revert’s desire to grow alongside with the Evmos Community.\n\n## Funding Amount\n\nThe requested amount of 200,000 Evmos goes fully to the Revert Finance team if the milestones and deliverables are met. If the Revert Finance team fails to deliver within 4 months after the proposal passed, the remaining funds will be returned. \n\nSignatories (3/5 Threshold):\n\n- DAO | Benny\n- OA | CtrlAltApe\n- Rok | Qubelabs\n- Mario | Revert Finance\n- Bosco | Silk Nodes\n\nSafe Deployment Address: [0x3d7E191cABba892CEa2E00D06C67aF08dfd58CdD](https://safe.evmos.org/home?safe=evmos:0x3d7E191cABba892CEa2E00D06C67aF08dfd58CdD&showCreationModal=true)",0.031684655526326565],["UnknownProposalTypeError\n\nError: UnknownProposalTypeError: ProposalContent can not be decoded for unknown ProposalType.\n\nType URL:\n/evmos.erc20.v1.RegisterERC20Proposal",0.01653527705410714],["UnknownProposalTypeError\n\nError: UnknownProposalTypeError: ProposalContent can not be decoded for unknown ProposalType.\n\nType URL:\n/evmos.erc20.v1.RegisterCoinProposal",0.006854889200703059],["Inferno - An incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in Forge\n\n# Inferno - An incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in Forge\n\n## Authors\n\n- Evmos DAO ([Telegram](https://t.me/evmosdao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO))\n- Orbital Apes ([Website](https://www.orbitalapes.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OrbitalApes))\n- Forge ([Telegram](http://t.me/forgedex),  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex))\n\n## Summary\n\nIntroducing **Inferno** - a 12 week long incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in [Forge](https://app.forge.trade/#/swap), the community owned DEX of Evmos. The Forge team is requesting 3,000,000 Evmos to fund this initiative. The program aims to solve the liquidity issue on Evmos but also leverages the potential of concentrated liquidity and staked assets. Such a highly attractive incentive program combined with concentrated liquidity and LST has never been done in the Cosmos ecosystem before. Potentially making Forge the most capital efficient DEX within the Cosmos!\n\n## Goal\n\nCreate sustainable liquidity and volume on Forge but also raise awareness about DeFi on Cosmos with solidity-based applications. \n\n## Abstract\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Evmos blockchain has the potential to become a unique environment for DeFi in the IBC ecosystem, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth. By incentivizing staked assets (such as stEVMOS, stATOM, rETH) people will earn staking rewards while providing liquidity and participate in the incentive program; no DEX on Cosmos has done this yet which is a unique value proposition of Forge. On top of that highly concentrated pools can be created between the native and staked asset (such as stATOM/ATOM) with limited impermanent loss risks but lot of revenue potential.\n\n**Action plan and Pools** \n\nThe full incentive program has a duration of 84 days - divided into 4 periods of 21 days.  Before each period the incentive rewards will be liquid staked to stEVMOS and rolled into the 21 days program. As a result of liquid staking, the Stride DAO council committed to add 1,000 STRD/day to the incentive program. \n\nWe selected 7 pools in total and put them into three different incentive tiers. Our goal is to avoid fragmentation and get deep base liquidity on Evmos. The requested daily emissions equal to 7.9% of the current staking emissions. Users providing liquidity will potentially earn staking rewards, liquidity emissions from this program and LP fees. To find a rough estimate of the APR at $1M TVL per pool, please open the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133w6CmVNSxg78Zbtmd83VDrux244WXUsQbeqqO--PHY/edit?usp=sharing). Keep in mind that if the TVL is below $1M TVL, the APR is higher and vice versa.  \n\n**Tier 1 - ~9,286 EVMOS daily emission per pool**\n\n- stEVMOS/stATOM\n- stEVMOS/axlUSDC (+ 600 Stride incentives)\n- stEVMOS/axlRETH\n\n**Tier 2 - ~2,589 EVMOS daily emission per pool**\n\n- stEVMOS/STRD  (+ 200 Stride incentives)\n- stATOM/ATOM (+ 200 Stride incentives)\n\n**Tier 3 - ~1,339 EVMOS daily emissions per pool**\n\n- axlUSDC/ceUSDT\n- axlRETH/axlWETH\n\n**Vesting**\n\nThe time-vesting uniswap staker is a [fork of the Uniswap v3 staker](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q) that adds a linear vesting period for positions to receive the full amounts of the accrued rewards. Linear vesing of rewards is intended to prevent ultra-concentrated liquidity from gaming the incentives and extract most of the rewards.  You can read more about it on this [post](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q).\n\nWhile the incentive rewards accrue proportional to *liquidity*, in the same way that trading fees do, the vested fraction increases linearly while the position is in range. Rewards that have not been accrued to positions not being staked or out of range or withdrawn before end of vesting period, would be rolled over to the next cycle.\n\n**Rewards claiming** \n\nVesting is calculated when you unstake the position. So, when you unstake the position, the contract checks if the liquidity was active for longer than the vesting period. If it is, you get all rewards for the amount of active liquidity you provided in the time period. if it's not it gives you the ratio of timespent/vesting period*(rewards received if there was no vesting period). \n\n**Timeline**\n\nIncentives can kick off once they're approved through governance and after Revert completes atleast the first two milestones of their funding proposal. We estimate the week of the 22nd May. \n\n**Adjustments**\n\nIf the liquidity of a pool does not match our expectation we might make adjustments on the allocation per pool as we learn during this program. Each change will be discussed on [Forge’s social channel](https://t.me/forgeDEX) and communicated upfront. \n\n## Multisig 4/6\n\nAll the funds will eventually flow to the liquidity providers.  \n\n- LPX | DAO\n- George | DAO\n- CtrlAltApe | OrbitalApes\n- John | Stride\n- Rok | Qubelabs\n- Luis | Interbloc\n\nSafe Deployment Address: [evmos:0xb75ce906a270F7680Faf1A2F6D70F4f28061B87a](https://safe.evmos.org/home?safe=evmos:0xb75ce906a270F7680Faf1A2F6D70F4f28061B87a&showCreationModal=true)\n\n## Highlighting Engaged Community Members\n\nSpecial thanks for input & feedback on this program from Luis (Interbloc), _Nick (active community member) and John Galt (Stride).",0.011405206379019761],["Turn on inflation rewards\n\nThis proposal turns on EVMOS inflation rewards (staking, developer incentives).

Without an Airdrop Calculator, it is costly in time and network resources for each team to manually track delegations and design an airdrop algorithm. This saves on dev time and gets airdrops into the hands of the Evmos community faster!\n\nCryptech is proposing to build a calculator web app with features for project teams, data analysts and individuals. The web app allows teams and analysts to choose an airdrop  distribution style (quadratic distribution, time-weight, single snapshot, etc.) and export a json or csv file that illustrates each wallet’s delegations, and the airdrop share they are expecting to receive. Additionally, the app will allow individuals to head to the Airdrop Calculator web page to calculate their delegations and the time spent delegating.\n\nThis app will help project teams save time calculating airdrop shares and help individuals track their delegations. To build this web application and make it available to the Evmos community, the Cryptech team is seeking 19,500 EVMOS tokens (~45k USD based on 14-day price average) to fund the following line items:\n\n- Full-stack web developer\n- Cloud infrastructure engineer\n- UX and graphics design\n- Data logging services and indexing\n- Running a private archival node until a public node is available\n- Web hosting for the application\n\nFor the sake of community confidence, the tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet controlled by community members, where 40% of the allocation to be provided up front to begin work and the remaining 60% to be delivered when MVP is online to continue improvement.\n\nMore details on the proposal and community discussion can be found here: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5178-evmos-grant-airdrop-calculator-built-by-cryptech-developments-ltd",0.32416726077539054],["Evmos Mainnet v5.0.0 Upgrade\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the 'v5.0.0' software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with 'erc20/' names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the 'MinGasPrice' and 'MinGasMultiplier' fee market parameters\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with 'erc20/'\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\n* Set the 'MinGasPrice' param value to '25,000,000,000aevmos' (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally.

The next 25% when the first project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (155279 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n3. The final 25% when the second project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (155279 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n\nA breakdown of costs across the two projects are (these are rough order of magnitude):\n\n1. Engineering Team/Developers/Product Lead - 625K\n2. Full time Designer (for both projects) - 75K\n3. Incubation space - 100K (covers space rent, utilities, laptops, monitors, all infrastructure including 6 servers)\n4. Audits - 125K (for the entire platform(s) including full stack software, not just the smart contracts)\n5. Operational Staff (payroll/HR/health insurance/misc software) - 75K\n\nEach engineering team/devs/product lead will comprise of: approximately 2 Web3 + backend engineers, 1 part-time or full time front-end engineers, and 1 product lead.\n\nThe initial 500K worth of Evmos token will be used to fund development to reach the funding milestones. These tokens and existing incubator resources will be used until those resources are exhausted. We will primarily aim to use OTC services to convert tokens to USD. When OTC services are unavailable or limited, we will use other means of conversion to USD. If OTC services are unavailable, we will limit ourselves to at most 50K a month in conversion to USD. The remaining 500K worth of Evmos will be staked until their corresponding development milestones are reached. \n\nA multisig will be set up to manage this schedule by members of the community. When the Evmos Foundation marks a particular project's MVP as complete, the associated tranche of tokens will be released to ChainHub.\n\n#### MULTISIG COMPOSITION\nThe multisig composition is 3/5.

EvLend takes the power of this concept and maximizes it for stablecoin markets.\n\nEvLend can demonstrate a standard model by which maximum efficiency of interest rates may be reached. Building such a system can lead to economies of scale and majority share of lending volume for a given core stablecoin.\n\nThe lead developer for EvLend is Max Feldman.\n\nHere is a video walk-through of the documentation by the team: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG0uZpD26w8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG0uZpD26w8) \n\nMore information on reactive rates, our stablecoin focus, and project development timeline can be found in the GitBook specs link above.\n\n2. **Evmos Bridge**\n\nProject Specs: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ91nSC5ZDun6xw5Kuc4agMnfX7i4y5fKPe5ESqchSWox](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ91nSC5ZDun6xw5Kuc4agMnfX7i4y5fKPe5ESqchSWox)\n\nWe propose a bridge tailored to maximize the ease of onboarding into the Evmos ecosystem. Our solution focuses on supporting the most bridge paths into and out of Evmos as well as focusing on user education to increase usage within the Evmos and broader Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nThe proposed bridge will consist of a liquidity network architecture utilizing native assets and thus no minting and burning. Additionally, we will build the cross-chain protocol leveraging a battle tested security and consensus model that is as secure as the economic security of the blockchains it is built upon.\n\nWith the minimal bridge paths available today, Evmos will continue to struggle with onboarding users and value into the ecosystem.\n\nProviding routes for users to bridge from the most popular DeFi hubs streamlines the process to onboard value into Evmos by orders of magnitude. By the end of Q3 2023 we plan on having Evmos, Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism integrated into the network.\n\nAdditionally, Chainhub will be resposible for running and maintaining the required validators for the liquidity network while this contract is active.\n\nThe lead developer for Evmos Bridge is Thad Hutcheson: \n\nHere is a video walk-through of the documentation by the team: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqmVj5UhVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqmVj5UhVk)\n\nFor more information regarding the specifications of the bridge please refer to the documentation or reach back out to us for any further questions.\n\n[^1]: We say \"approximate\" as we may not converge on two projects, or may converge on more than two per year.

Leveraging our existing user base and previously successful campaigns, Galxe will guide users through the Evmos ecosystem to complete on and off-chain tasks and reward them with EVMOS tokens for doing so. These campaigns will involve partnerships with current Evmos dapps, and can expand to more other protocols as they launch on Evmos as well. With a large portion of the Rektdrop being clawed back, users who missed out have a chance to engage with the ecosystem. This will bring value to the Evmos community through expanding the user base, and providing outside users with direct exposure to Evmos and its native dapps.\n\n2/3 Multisig members:\nLPX - EvmosDAO\nGV | Swiss staking - EvmosDAO\nMat - Galxe Team\n\nMultisig address:\n0x0d5BCc86Feb4c26e17D672e57775Ae80C5597932\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nGalxe is the leading Web3 credential data network in the world. A collaborative credential infrastructure enabling brands and developers to engage in communities and build robust products in Web3. Galxe’s infrastructure allows dApps to grow their community off chain and their protocol on chain through Galxe’s tools. Think of Galxe as a way to deploy on chain loyalty programs and customized growth marketing campaigns by distributing NFT badges. Up to this point, Galxe has over 11,100+ credentials contributed to its network, worked with over 1,200+ ecosystem partners, produced 8,000+ campaigns, and built up a community of 8.2M+ Galxe ID users. Credentials are a user’s footprint on or off the blockchain that represents their behaviors and actions taken (e.g., follow twitter, retweet, attend an AMA, swapping, staking, farming etc.)\n\nDiffusion, Orbital Apes, and SpaceFi have already agreed to be part of the Evmos Ecosystem Campaign on Galxe. The community can suggest other dapps that are live as well as future projects that launch on Evmos. Simple on-chain and off-chain tasks will be leveraged that will allow for high exposure and a low barrier of entry to the Evmos ecosystem. Potential tasks and credentials can include the following:\n\n● Following socials (Twitter/Discord)\n● Retweet/Quote Tweet a specific tweet\n● Make a swap\n● Provide liquidity\n● Buy an NFT and hold for X amount of time\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to drive off chain and on chain growth to the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n● Introduce the Galxe community of 8.2M+ active wallet addresses to the Evmos ecosystem\n● Introduce the broader crypto ecosystem to the Evmos ecosystem through Galxe’s tools and co-marketing power: Joint AMA’s, Blog post, Retweets, Quote Tweets, Tweets all throughout the campaign, Discord/Telegram communication, Campaign featured on our main carousel see: [https://galxe.com/campaigns](https://galxe.com/campaigns).\n● Engage users who aren’t currently in the ecosystem\n● Educate users on Evmos through learn to earn and participate to earn NFT campaigns\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nGalxe is requesting a rewards pool of $400k USD in Evmos that will go entirely to community members. We’re waiving integration fees for this type of campaign but want to make sure the participating community is incentivized and rewarded appropriately. Prior ecosystem campaigns have put forth rewards that have included token airdrop allocation and special governance rights. Solana put forth a rewards pool of $1M USD to participating users and Moonbeam allocated 1.5% of their token supply to this type of campaign. Funds will be handled and distributed by a multisig wallet controlled by the Evmos community throughout this entire process. The community members who take part in the engagements can expect to receive the funds after the campaign is over. The Evmos Community can decide how reward distribution will be handled. After the integration of Evmos into Galxe, any dApp in the Evmos ecosystem will be able to run growth campaigns on Evmos on Galxe for years to come.\n\n [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7622-evmos-ecosystem-campaign-by-galxe](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7622-evmos-ecosystem-campaign-by-galxe)",0.3197792093398158],["The Alternative: An Honest DAO and an Independent Evmos Chain\n\nMy real name is Loredana Cirstea. I have been volunteering for more than 100h/week for Evmos, Ethermint, and blockchain technologies. For the core Evmos I have implemented the fee split module (renamed to revenue), global minimum gas limit, first to prototype and demo working, innovative precompiles for having access to IBC, Cosmos SDK, IPFS, IPLD, etc. from inside the EVM. More information [here](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/tree/master/evmos). My work is proven by [GitHub](https://github.com/loredanacirstea) and [my technical demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos).

And I manage the evmos4volunteers validator.\n\nI invested all my energy and skills to make Evmos better and showing others what it can do, since February 2022.\n\n## An Independent Evmos Chain\n\nI want to see Evmos DAO as a body that fully implements the independence of Evmos:\n- the Evmos Community cannot be rug pulled by unknown dues from just a couple of actors.\n- the investors of Evmos (those who brought value and raised the price of Evmos for everyone's benefit) and the contributors of effort to Evmos have a strong say in the governance of Evmos \n- the Evmos DAO does not have hidden influences from any 3rd party\n- the Evmos DAO is subservient to the Evmos Chain\n- the Evmos DAO bodies have a mechanism of checks and balances that will disincentivize corrupt practices\n\n## The ECP-x Proposals - Issues\n\nLooking at proposal https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83 and [the subsequent proposals in plan](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions/2.%20Evmos%20DAO%20Proposals) by the same group (led by LPX, Bennylava, GV), the issues are:\n- the authors baked their names in the formation of the organization\n- all operations of their organization have not been public\n- they started filling out roles before the organization was ratified on-chain\n- they dismissed other competing ideas for Evmos DAO that were already presented\n- they don't accept improvements to their text if you tell them what is wrong\n- they already have bigger powers in the Evmos Discord than any other validator or investor, even in their unofficial capacity, and they can focus the attention of voters and validators on topics that they want\n- their real identities are not known to the Evmos Community\n- they have no supervisor to hold them accountable. The Evmos Community cannot do that, because their operations are not public\n- I have been contributing as a volunteer to Evmos from before its genesis but I (nor others who contributed to Evmos governance) was not invited by this group to join this governance workstream. So, it is not merit that earns you a position in their governance workstream.\n- their relationship with Tharsis and Evmos Foundation is unclear. If they have formed this group and given them the above powers, then there is no Evmos Community in the Evmos DAO, and between the voting power of the core team, VC validators, foundation delegations promises, a controlled governance process, there is no chain independence.\n- their texts for Evmos DAO are very long, lack substance, and are evasive. Formation texts need to be precise.\n- the erosion of Governance (as we know it in Cosmos):\n    - [ECP-2A]/Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)/B. Off-Chain Community Governance (In Progress) has conflicts of control: what happens when the Cosmos side votes YES on a proposal and the EVM side votes NO on the same proposal? (These types of problems have been solved by my quasar solution.)\n    - [ECP-3] talks about $GOV as governance token.

Nor should the chain accept to pay for services that were not solicited. My proposal for this: [Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services)\n- the quasar technology (cosmos sdk <-> EVM communication) that I invented (and demoed) will be able to bring flexible governance on-chain, to the token holders.

The support shown by the community is not taken for granted - our pledge for progressive decentralization is at the core of everything we do, and we are committed to working to build a stronger, brighter ecosystem for Evmos. For those that want to deep-dive into the philosophical reasoning behind our proposal, [a prologue has been published (warning: long read).](https://mirror.xyz/evmosdao.eth/rSZyD_MAO4zkA46lvqi-f9P5YfVBrnMsU3TShBWK-sY)\n### The Governance Council\nThe Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\nThe Governance Council's wide array of achievements and community work for the past half-year are listed in the *Progress Report* section of ECP-2A.\n\nWe also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and even replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.\nGet familiarized with our short to mid-term initiatives with through the [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper).\n## Funding Request\nWe recognize the current market conditions and its volatility, while unfortunate, we must continue to push forward. We have pegged the price of Evmos to $0.50 for this Funding Cycle (6-months).\n\n- **A. Contributor Compensations:** 1,233,668 EVMOS\n- **B. Research & Development Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS\n- **C.

This proposal has a voting time of 120 hours.\n\n### Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validate/upgrades).\n\n### Impact\n\nEvmos v12.0.0 contains the following changes and enhancements:\n\n- Enable basic implementation of Fee Subscription to pay for transaction fees with unclaimed staking rewards\n- Support multiple message schemas with EIP-712\n- Remove Ethermint dependency by migrating relevant logic to the Evmos codebase to allow for quicker development iteration\n- Restrict EVM module to work only with Evmos chain\n- Upgrade Tendermint to [v0.34.26](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.26) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.46.10](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.10)\n- Grant full amount of airdropped tokens to users affected by an airdrop [early decay bug](https://github.com/evmos/decay-analysis)\n- Many small improvements and refactors\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v12.0.0).\n\n### Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md).

An EVMOS community member since launch, EVMOS Telegram unofficial Chinese channel Mod + EVMOS Wechat Group Creator.\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nIntroducing View Exchange - A decentralized derivatives exchange on EVMOS.\n\nWe believe EVMOS is the most powerful and efficient Layer 1 to provide users with a seamless trading experience. EVMOS's scalability, robustness, and compatibility with the EVM, make it an approprate soil for our Derivatives Exchange, ensuring fast and secure transactions. By leveraging EVMOS's advanced features, we aim to offer users a reliable and innovative trading platform that meets their needs while maximizing liquidity and minimizing costs.\n\nBy launching **FIRST Derivatives exchange** on EVMOS, View Exchange aims to attract more users and traders to the EVMOS ecosystem, which can result in greater liquidity and TVL. This can ultimately help create a more vibrant and robust DeFi ecosystem on EVMOS.\n\n# **The exchange will have below features:**\n\n- Decentralized Derivatives Exchange: traders can long/short an asset with Low Leverage initially to avoid high slippage, leverage will be set higher in the future when liquidity has met a certain threshold.\n- Simple experience: trade directly from your wallet.\n- Low fees: built on EVMOS with low gas fee.\n\n## **Benefits to the Ecosystem:**\n\n1. **Breaking Ecosystem barriers**: Remove the barriers that hinder derivative trading within the ecosystem, enabling more derivative traders to discover the Evmos and attract a greater number of traders.\n2. **Crypto on-ramp**: with on-ramp solution integration, we simplify the process of acquiring and onboarding new users by providing them with a seamless method to convert fiat currency into EVMOS ecosystem assets. This will enhance accessibility and attract a larger user base.\n3. **Greater Liquidity**: By launching a Derivatives exchange, we can attract a larger number of users and traders, which can result in greater liquidity. This will allow traders to execute larger orders without affecting the market price, resulting in a more efficient and reliable trading experience.\n4. **Token Buybacks**: the revenue generated from the protocol will be used to buy back the tokens from the market & burn, in order to maintain the market confidence.\n\n**If this proposal passed, the project development will be kick start immediately.**\n\n## **Project Follow up:**\n\n- A Project Progress Report will be released bi-weekly to the community.\n- Communication channels will be always open to answer all the questions.\n\n## **Tokenomics:**\n\n- Token Name: View Exchange Tokens (VE)\n- Max Supply: to be determined\n- Initial Supply: 10% ( 5% airdrop + 5% incentives = 10% inital circulating supply)\n\nDetails of the tokenomics will be introduced close to the mainnet launch.\n\n## **Allocation:**\n\n**Airdrop and Incentives:**\n\nTo express gratitude for the community's efforts, we have allocated 10% of View Exchange Tokens (VE) as follows:\n\n- Airdrop 5% of the tokens to EVMOS holders who have voted for this proposal.(yes, no, abstain)\n- Allocate 5% of the tokens as incentives for protocol users and social task engagement platforms such as Galxe, Zealy, Rabbithole, Layer 3, etc., aiming to attract more users to experience the EVMOS ecosystem.\n- We airdrop to those who voted for this proposal rather than the whole EVMOS addresses because we want to incentivize active participation in the EVMOS governance model. By limiting airdrop rewards to voters, we establish a mechanism where one's voice and opinion directly translate to clear benefits and rewards.

This proposal is an endeavor to enable Terra developers to continue building and innovating. Furthermore, this aims to be a lifeline for their existing users to continue to benefit from these developers’ platforms.\n\nSeveral Terra projects have reached out and expressed interest in migrating to and developing on Juno Network.

The Juno Hacker’s lounge will be a great place for developers/talents to network and connect. In close coordination with the Core-1 team, we will make the best use of the Hacker’s lounge.\n\nDescription:\n\nCosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 26-28, 2022 (3 Day Event)\n\nOur goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.\nWe expect around 1,000 attendees, with the majority coming from Latin American countries - a huge market in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nCosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.\n\nCosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.\n\nWhere do the funds go?\n\n- Conference venue\n- F&B (conference + afterparty)\n- Marketing and communications\n- Production, audio and visuals\n- Operational & logistical costs\nLegal\n\nThe current cost for the 3-day event already exceeds $300k. Receiving support from the Juno community would contribute tremendously to ensuring that Cosmoverse will be a great success.\n\nHow does it benefit the Juno community?\n\nBy allocating 15,000 Juno from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, Juno will become the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

Currently the floor to become an active validator is quite high, at nearly 47,700 JUNO or approximately $168,000 USD.\n\nAs of right now, there is currently a number of validators sitting just outside the active set who have also been active historically, with many more waiting for a set expansion to join in consensus. A more diverse set of validators brings new ideas into the space, new viewpoints in governance and often leads to new innovation and development for the chain.\n\nAs with all set expansions, it is possible that expanding the set could have a small effect on the overall block times taking longer, as more validators will be required to achieve consensus. After reviewing analysis of previous set expansions, these effects appear negligible upon block times during that period, but it is important to communicate clearly both the pros and cons of any parameter change to the network.\n\n## Decentralization of Stake\n\nSet expansions are not a perfect science, and in reviewing that same analysis provided by some other talented validators, we have seen that historically these expansions don't always lead to further decentralization of stake on their own. \n\nWe hope that delegators will take the opportunity of this set expansion to **rebalance their stake** from the top of the active set to competent validators lower on the list.\n\nBalancing your stake **outside the top 10 to 20 validators** on the network is the best way to assist in this initiative, as we work together as a community to improve the voting power balance on Juno even further.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWe also strongly encourage new validators entering the set to avoid behavior such as **NFT giveaways**, **validator specific snapshots** or **commission refunds/rebates** which circumvent the 5 percent minimum commissions as established by [Juno Network Prop 3](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/3).\n\nEqually we recommend that delegators and investors avoid participating in these activities if they see them, and instead find strong validators which respect and follow the parameters of the network as they were established through the governance, by the community.

Since the passing of the Terra Developer Fund Proposal, 18 projects have pulled themselves from the wreckage of the Terra collapse and found a new home on Juno. In this process of delivering aid to Terra projects, we noticed that Terra developers aren't the only ones who could use a little help. There are many new projects building on Juno, or who wish to build on Juno, that could benefit from community support.\n\nThe rapid ascent of projects on Juno has been fantastic, but in an increasingly competitive landscape, we must maintain this momentum and drive growth sustainably for the long term. We can now do this with the Growth Fund, one led by community members, operated transparently, and owned by Juno governance. We now have the time and opportunity to build up the ideal form of this DAO. We must have more human resources, diverse views, and representatives from the community - as well as a means to collaborate with outside capital partners to participate alongside the Juno Community in funding these protocols. The projects built in this bear market will define Juno's future as a leader in the Cosmos, a home for projects and protocols, and a community-driven incubator for the CosmWasm interchain.\n\nThis proposal would transition the Terra Developer Fund into an official Grow Juno SubDAO. This proposal aims to expand the membership to include members from the community with professional investing experience, analyst skill sets and valuable business acumen. As a community initiative, we are purposefully aiming to have less representation from Core-1, and stronger representation from experts within the community.\n\nThis proposal will expand upon Proposal 23 by extending the scope beyond Terra migrations to include all new projects and investments conducive to the growth and development of Juno, to bring more value to Juno holders as a whole, as well as new investment opportunities which expand the Juno's Community Pool and make it a sustainable resource for continued growth and community endeavors. \n\nThe [Terra Developer Fund Treasury](https://legacy.daodao.zone/multisig/juno1lgnstas4ruflg0eta394y8epq67s4rzhg5anssz3rc5zwvjmmvcql6qps2) will be transferred to the Grow Juno SubDAO and will seed the initial SubDAO treasury.\n\n## Creation of SubDAO\n\nIf passed, an official SubDAO will be created so that the Juno community maintains control of the SubDAO itself, and its associated treasury.\n\nAt the time of Prop 23 passing, the DAODAO SubDAO system was not available. Now that it is available, it is a much better setup than a normal multisig and with DAODAO V2 on the way, this will only make SubDAOs more effective.\n\n**Some key benefits are:**\n\n- Community control of SubDAO membership.\n- Community control of SubDAO treasury.\n- Formalization of the purpose of this SubDAO: To grow the overall ecosystem and bring in new capital.\n- Control from the community to return funds to the Community Pool, if it deems necessary.\n- Control from the community to add or remove members and the entire SubDAO, if it deems necessary.\n\n**Specific mandates:**\n\n1) The Grow Juno SubDAO will seek community approval (through on-chain signaling proposal) for any grants above k to any single entity.\n\n2) The Grow Juno SubDAO will actively seek out projects and investments which can contribute strong token swaps and/or obvious profits to the Community Pool, and will always aim to take actions which maintain the sustainability of the fund for the Juno community. In some cases, public goods may be funded, subject to the same limitations as above, insofar as they unlock key functionality for promising new protocols, (i.e. oracles, infrastructure partners, indexing, protocol code audits, etc)\n\n3) The Grow Juno SubDAO Treasury is subject to the control of the entire community. The community has the ability to cancel any outstanding funding and/or return funds to the community pool, at any time through governance, for any reason.\n\n4) The Grow Juno SubDAO membership will be established by governance, and will be maintained and changed using DAO voting, as necessary to accommodate and adjust its membership to the needs of the Juno Community. At any time, on-chain governance can override membership, as with all SubDAOs.\n\n5) As the membership is expanding, it's important to mandate that, where notable conflicts of interest may occur, members are expected to vote to abstain and recuse themselves. Simply being an investor in a project shall not be deemed to be a conflict of interest.\n\n6) The Grow Juno SubDAO will encourage and assist protocols in seeking additional supplementary funding with outside capital and funding partners to lower the risk of funding issuance by the Juno community, and will help to bring in new capital to the ecosystem through venture partners.\n\n7) Being an investor in projects is encouraged, and many of the venture investors working alongside the DAO can and should take on the risk of investing in protocols coming into the ecosystem.

Such methods included offering grants, Hack Juno rewards, or community-pool based funding approved via governance.\nBut what if the chain offered built-in incentives for development on Junø? Will it attract further development and contributors to begin landing on Junø?\n## Contributor Fee-Based Incentives\nThe proposed solution is constructed around rewarding developers based on the overall user interest in what has been developed, which is potentially a longterm continuous reward.\nFor each smart contract, there will be a fee recipient address which is defaulted to the creator address.\nThe fee split parameter would be configurable via governance. As of now, we propose a 50/50% split.\nFor each transaction which executes the smart contract, 50% of the transaction fee is distributed to the fee recipient address. The remaining 50% is distributed to stakers.\nThis mechanism allows developers to be fairly rewarded as long as their development is raising activity and users are transacting with their smart contract. Fee distribution will not require voting or permission, and acts as longterm potential revenue, which can attract more developers to build on Junø.\n## How Contributor Incentives can commend DAOs\nOne of the optimistic outcomes will be the integration between DAO treasuries and on-chain smart contracts, where the treasury address can be the contract’s fee recipient address to receive fee-based incentives.\nFor example, JunoSwap can set the RAW DAO treasury as the contributor address, where 50% of the fees collected by JunoSwap transactions will be automatically received by the RAW DAO.\n## Postscript\nThis is a signaling proposal to evaluate the community’s interest in the proposed “Contributor Fee-Based Incentives” mechanism.

Many major DeFi protocols depend upon decentralized price feeds to function correctly. This is a rapid solution to provide that functionality.\n- Currently, projects on Juno wanting to access price feeds have to pay excessive fees to access these feeds, which can be prohibitive for a start-up.\n- Implementing a Price Oracle on Juno natively would give Juno (and the community) control over this public good.\n- Even if better solutions come along, this is a rapidly implementable stop-gap solution that can be deployed. Future oracles and providers may improve upon this service.\n- Juno would be the first *permissionless* CosmWasm chain with an on-chain Price Oracle, which is a valid differentiator for builders seeking to deploy DeFi protocols in a permissionless environment.\n\n### Cons\n\n- Validators will have to run additional software to ensure the price oracle is decentralized. Failure to do so will result in soft-slashing, so Juno stakers and validators face a non-zero risk of soft-slashing. Soft-slashing is set at 0.01% on Juno. *(The slashing window is an adjustable parameter and will be set conservatively at first to allow validators to gain software familiarity.)*\n- Some blockchains have already added price oracles, though none are permissionless.

Community support is vital in our opinion, which is why we want to ask the approval of the Juno community to have JUNO enabled in the plugin with this proposal.\n* Vote Yes if you are in favor of having JUNO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay\n* Vote No if you don’t want JUNO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay\n\n## Details\n### Who is BitCanna?\nBitCanna has been found by and for the cannabis industry. It aims to provide a secure and efficient way for businesses and consumers to transact using blockchain technology to create a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions, enabling fast and secure payments without the need for intermediaries. The platform also includes a range of tools and services for merchants, such as point-of-sale systems and financial management tools. With BitCanna, the cannabis industry can benefit from the advantages of digital currencies, including low transaction fees, global accessibility, and increased security.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.bitcanna.io](https://www.bitcanna.io)\n\n### What is Cosmos Pay?\nCosmos Pay is an open-source plugin developed by BitCanna for the e-commerce. Currently it is live for the platforms WooCommerce and Prestashop. Keplr is integrated, making the user experience to pay as smooth as possible.\nThe plugin offers the possibility to integrate a lot (if not all) Cosmos-SDK based cryptocurrencies and is therefore an addition to the tools the Cosmos ecosystem already has to offer. In the current setup ATOM, OSMO, JUNO and BCNA are supported; with more to come in the (near) future. Find out more [here](https://commerce.bitcanna.io).\n\n### Why this proposal?\nSupport from the community is one of the greatest perks in the Cosmos-ecosystem. Via this route we want to give the Juno community a chance to have their say in this and to have a method to express their support of the Juno community to have JUNO enabled as a coin in the Cosmos Pay plugin. Similar proposals will be uploaded to the Osmosis and Cosmos communities to get their support as well.\n\n### Commonwealth thread:\n[https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/8507-community-consent-cosmos-pay-supporting-juno](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/8507-community-consent-cosmos-pay-supporting-juno)",0.18547854887942675],["Launch Sauce SubDAO\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Produce 5 creative and original thought-provoking memes or gifs per week that capture the attention of the Cosmos and inspire.

Titles will always include SAUCE or MEME , and discussion will gravitate to Juno News (but may go off topic sometimes).\n- Any ''FUD'' or drama directed at Juno will instantly be dealt with by the meme army AND we will not hesitate to resort to ''Twitter bots'' to sway engagement in our favour.\n- Will be organizing a monthly Poker Tournament for the Juno community. Any donations for prizes are welcome for this initiative.\n- Hold a monthly JUNO meme competition\n- Hold a JUNO meme class and an educational workshop on how to create memes.\n- Partial coverage of Juno spaces and other Juno news by Rekt News.\n\nIf the communication subDAO is polite and neutral, the Juno Sauce subDAO aims to be loud and capture the attention of Crypto Twitter.\n\n### Value added\n\n- Bringing a sense of belonging to the Juno community,\n- Bringing a sense of fun and playfulness.

The scope of this proposal is for 1 month.\n\n### Background\n\nMemes are one of the best ways to grow a community especially in the crypto space. Some of the biggest accounts on crypto Twitter with the largest following and engagement are simply meme accounts.\n\nMeme accounts are some of the purest forms of comedy. Memes are a form of online communication that can be a fun and effective way to share ideas and culture. They often use humor and creativity to make complex ideas more accessible, and can help bring people together around a common interest or topic. Additionally, memes can be a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing people to express their opinions and engage in political and cultural discussions in a way that is relatable and engaging. Overall, memes can be a positive force in culture by promoting communication and collaboration, as well as providing a platform for artistic expression and social commentary.\n\n### Members\n\nRekt Zerker: Professional memer and shitposter\nRektVee: Professional memer and FUDmaster\nGiannisMartakos: Professional memer, community manager and GIF artist\nKingJulianIam: DeFi content creator and analyst\nrekt_news: Who knows who they are\nBbands: Twitter Spaces extraordinaire\nCosmos Junky: He has Cosmos in his name, must be legit\nHodl Juno: He hodls Juno, definitely qualified\nTenderMint Timmy: Leader of Joes\nRobo Racoon: Can you imagine the smell?\nEmir: Good vibes person\nFarmer Stars: Makes gud memes\n\n### Why\n\nThe special sauce that brings Juno together.

We have three main topics that we will consider as Hackathon content; DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi.\n\nGoal:\n\nAs the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem, our primary purpose in wanting to realize the \"HackJuno Turkey Hackathon\" event is to introduce the Cosmos network, especially the Juno Ecosystem, to the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem and market because many projects that we can develop with the Cosmos and Juno ecosystem will bring us to the forefront in the international and national sense, especially the Blockchain and Web3 communities in Turkey.\n\nSocial Responsibility:\n\nOur aim on this path, which we set out with the motto of awareness, is to create and shape the motivation of potential web3 developers while organizing a hackathon. The \"Turkey Inter-University E-sports Tournament,\" which is among the events we will collect in parallel with the \"HackJuno Turkey\" hackathon, also carries a social responsibility purpose with the training we will give to the tournament participants at the workshops. Bringing potential talent and creators from Blockchain, Web3, and GameFi into the ecosystem is one of our main objectives at this event.\n\nWhy are we different from other Hackathons?\n\nThe main thing that will make HackJuno Turkey different from other Hackathons is education and awareness.

Specifically, at the time of removal from the liquidity pool, all available $JUNO will be sent to the Juno Community Pool and all available $WYND will be sent to the WYND DAO.\n1.

This drastically increases the UX and UI of the networks utility tokens. As a developer, it also removes the need to support both native assets and CW20 in your contracts.\nDAOs/SubDAOs can control a contract which mints tokens for other business logic in your contracts through our [TokenFactory Middleware Contracts](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/tokenfactory-contracts).\n\n## CosmWasm v0.30\n\nYou can read all of the great features in x/wasmd v0.30.0 in [Confio's medium article here](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/wasmd-0-30-released-8e9932929238).\n\n## Packet Forward Middleware\n\nThis new middleware allows for the forwarding of IBC packets through Juno's infrastructure to final destination chains. As cosmos zones expand, the need for multi-hop transactions will increase for scaling. \nThis new module allows for Juno to be a \"relay\" chain for other zones. Where a newly launched chain can just focus on relaying to and from Juno, and in return can route these packets to all the zones Juno is connected too. \nWith this, public relayers will be able to earn fees in the future with these transactions along with the [ICS29 IBCFees module added in this update](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/main/docs/middleware/ics29-fee).\n\n## Other Changes\n\n- Complete overhaul of the main app for easier upgradeability\n- ICA Host and Controller\n- Allow all ICA messages\n- Latest IAVL, Tendermint, and Cosmos SDK (v0.45.14)\n- junod debug bech32-convert\n- junod debug export-derive-balances\n- junod debug forceprune\n- junod reset [app|wasm] directory files\n\n\n\n## Voting Options\n\nYES: Agree to proceed with Juno v13 network upgrade.\n\nNO: Disagree with the Juno v13 network upgrade.\n\nNO WITH VETO: Disagree with the Juno v13 network upgrade and want depositors penalized.\n\nABSTAIN: Decline to give an opinion on the Juno v13 network upgrade.\n\n",0.0010085033315597365],["Increase maximum per block gas to 100 million\n\n# Increase Per Block Gas\n\n[Commonwealth Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/10396-increase-maximum-per-block-gas-to-100-million)\n\nPreviously in [Juno proposal 6](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/6), the team lowered per block gas to 10 million *(from 100 million)* to stop potential attacks against the network.

Because half will be staked, this will reduce the current overall APR from ~33.53% to ~33.23%, which represents a ~0.3% reduction. The establishment of deep liquidity in the wyJUNO/JUNO pool paves the way for vast DeFi opportunities on Juno and is expected to drive more LSD and DeFi adoption through current and future project synergies. The WYND team strongly feels that the minor APR reduction will be offset by increased on-chain activity and TVL growth resulting from this POL.\n\n\n**Multisignature**\nThe same multisignature address used in the [first POL](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/141) will be used for this proposal.\n- Esse (Made in Block Validator)\n- Jakub (WYND Developer)\n- Rarma (Community Member)\n- CryptoCakir (Stake & Relax Validator)\n- Mike Purvis (CronCat co-founder)\nMultisig can be viewed here: [https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1nmua4tj8kxvfmzexx8vuggv2zzq24hf8t7grvjjvc2xjll3vjwyqf4eshn](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1nmua4tj8kxvfmzexx8vuggv2zzq24hf8t7grvjjvc2xjll3vjwyqf4eshn)\n\n\n**Voting**\n\nYES - You agree to provide 1,000,000 $JUNO from the community pool as Protocol Owned Liquidity to be deposited into the wyJUNO/JUNO pool\nNO - You do not agree to provide 1,000,000 $JUNO from the community pool as Protocol Owned Liquidity to be deposited into the wyJUNO/JUNO pool\nABSTAIN - You formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal\nNO WITH VETO - You would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their 1000 JUNO deposit, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.\n\n[Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/10476-protocol-owned-liquidity-wyjunojuno-staking-swap-pool)",0.04132636469602835],["Juno Upgrade: Aurora v14\n\n# Juno Aurora Upgrade (v14)\n\n[Juno Medium v14 Article](https://medium.com/@JunoNetwork/jun%C3%B8-aurora-ac67a8143e22)\n\nThis upgrade brings the following major changes to Juno Network:\n- x/GlobalFee Module\n- x/IBC-Hooks Module\n- 0 Fee IBC Relaying\n- Stargate Staking Queries\n- Tokenfactory: ForceTransfer, MintTo, and BurnFrom (admin only)\n- x/wasmd 0.31\n- wasmvm 1.2.1\n- Skip's mev CometBFT by default\n\n## x/GlobalFee Module\n\n[Signaling proposal from December 13th, 2022: PASSED](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/68)\n\nCurrently on cosmos based chains, the validators are fully in control of the network fees. With this new module, a minimum gas fee is set by governance to set the gas floor.\n\nAt the upgrade, gas fees are set to our [setup documentation gas prices default](https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/joining-mainnet#set-minimum-gas-prices):\n- 0.0025ujuno\n- 0.001uatom (ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9)\n\nAt any time, governance can increase these fees across the network to help deliver more for developers (through feeshare) and stakers. It can also add new tokens to be accepted as fees, such as OSMO and/or USDC in the future.\nIf an transaction attack occurs on Juno, validators are still able to raise their fees ABOVE the minimum gas fee to protect the network as needed.\n\nThe only exception to this are bypassed messages for IBC relaying and transfers. These messages are exempt from the minimum gas fee within reasonable limits. For this to work, validators **must** set their fees to be: '0ujuno,0ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9' in their app.toml.

You can find an example of this with the [contract example](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/v1.2.1/contracts/virus). Some other notable improvements include:\n- Governance based weighted votes\n- new queries from wasmvm 1.2 (add the cosmwasm_1_2 feature in your contract toml)\n- Uint128/Decimal multiplication\n- A new 'Never' type\n\n## New Token Factory Methods\n\nFrom the previous upgrade, v13, we added the x/TokenFactory module to deliver a better UX for developers and users alike. As the admin of a token denomination you can now Force transfer tokens between accounts, Mint directly to an account, and burn from another account. In the future we will also add support for disabling the sending of tokens, and only allowing minting/burning for specific application needs.\n\n## Stargate Staking Queries\n\nContracts can now query the chain for an accounts: Delegation, Redelegations, and Unbonding information.\n\n## Skip MEV by default\n\nWith the passing of [Juno proposal 275](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/275), Skip's MEV CometBFT consensus is now used by default.\n\n## Command Line improvements\n\nYou can now specify the following configurations for any transaction commands you run:\n- Gas\n- Gas Prices\n- Gas Adjustment\n- Fees\n- Fee-Account\n- Note (memo)\n\nSet these with **junod config fees 5000ujuno** or **junod config gas-prices 0.0025ujuno**.\n\n---\n\n\n## Voting Options\n\nYES: Agree to proceed with Juno v14 network upgrade.\n\nNO: Disagree with the Juno v14 network upgrade.\n\nNO WITH VETO: Disagree with the Juno v14 network upgrade and want depositors penalized.\n\nABSTAIN: Decline to give an opinion on the Juno v14 network upgrade.\n\n",0.00021256293511691857],["WYND DEX External Incentives for WYND/JUNO Pool\n\n***There was an error in prop #283.

With DAO DAO, projects have immediate access to best-in-class DAO tooling without creating their own governance modules, smart contracts, DAO management and more.\n\nYou can use it on Juno today! [https://daodao.zone](https://daodao.zone)\n\nWe propose a token swap between DAO DAO and Juno. DAO DAO is offering 1,100,002.7 $DAO (10% of total supply, over 50% of liquid supply) in exchange for 500,000 $JUNO (~3.28% of current Community Pool funds). The tokens shall vest linearly, with a fixed amount unlocking every block, over two years. These funds will support and accelerate the future development of DAO DAO. DAO DAO will stake these tokens with a diverse set of validators as determined by the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q), *excluding* the [DAO DAO validator](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/validators/junovaloper185hgkqs8q8ysnc8cvkgd8j2knnq2m0ah6ae73gntv9ampgwpmrxqlfzywn).\n\nThe $DAO tokens will allow the Juno community to vote on how funds should be used, as well as on the future direction of DAO DAO. After this token swap is completed, Juno will own the largest share of liquid $DAO tokens, giving it substantial influence over the future direction of DAO DAO.\n\n$DAO tokens from the swap will go to the Juno Growth Fund SubDAO, to be managed by them until otherwise directed by the Juno community. The JGF will actively participate in DAO DAO governance to ensure that DAO DAO's actions are aligned with the interests of Juno stakers. As an Official SubDAO, the Juno community will be able to change this arrangement at any time and shall remain the ultimate deciders on how the tokens should be distributed.\n\nWith some of the best developers in the Cosmos ecosystem working on DAO DAO, this swap will help align incentives between DAO DAO and the Juno community and accelerate future development. We hope that many protocols and DAOs will continue to use our tools and create value for the community.\n\n## What is $DAO?\n\nThe DAOs that rely on DAO DAO deserve a say in how DAO DAO works. $DAO gives you a voice in this DAO of DAOs. We give that voice to the contributors who build DAO DAO, and to the DAOs that use it.\n\n$DAO won't pay dividends, and it doesn't entitle holders to the fruits of others' labor.\n\nWe envision DAO DAO as a DAO of DAOs. By giving $DAO to Juno, we invite Juno to become a member of DAO DAO. Through this swap, Juno will have a say in DAO DAO, and DAO DAO will have a say in Juno. This swap reflects the mutualistic relationship that already exists between Juno and DAO DAO; each supports the other.\n\n## Token Swap and Vesting Mechanics\n\nIn coordination with the [Juno Growth Fund](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1xz54y0ktew0dcm00f9vjw0p7x29pa4j5p9rwq6zerkytugzg27qs4shxnt#proposals), we have created audited vesting contracts that any project on Juno can utilize.\n\nThis proposal will send 500,000 $JUNO to the JGF, who will then instantiate a new [cw-vesting](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/tree/main/contracts/external/cw-vesting) contract with the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q) as the recipient for the full amount to be vested linearly over a two-year period, with a start date matching the passing of this proposal. Upon the passing and successful execution of this proposal, the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q) will vote to vest 1,100,002.7 $DAO tokens linearly over a period of two years (also with a start date matching the passing of this proposal) to the Juno Growth Fund, who will manage the funds on behalf and under the direction of the community.\n\nThe Juno Growth Fund will be the admin and owner of the vesting contract and will also maintain temporary control over the $DAO tokens. As it is an Official Juno SubDAO, the Juno Community also has full control by proxy. Should for whatever reason DAO DAO fail to vest the 1,100,002.7 $DAO tokens, dissatisfy the community, or not live up to expectations, the Juno Community or Juno Growth Fund can vote to cancel payment of the remaining unvested $JUNO funds. In addition, the Juno Growth Fund will be able to stake vested $DAO tokens and vote to represent Juno's interests in the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q).\n\n**Conditions for cancelation:**\n\n- DAO DAO delegates vested funds to its own validator\n- DAO DAO stops developing new features\n- DAO DAO radically changes its tokenomics in a way that the Juno Community is unhappy with\n- The Juno community becomes displeased with DAO DAO for *whatever reason*\n\n*In the event of a dispute, Juno Community governance shall be the ultimate arbitrator.*\n\nShould DAO DAO launch a chain in the coming years (which it has no plans to do at the present moment), DAO DAO commits to an airdrop for $JUNO stakers during the incubation period for incubating DAO DAO.\n\n## Future $DAO Distributions\n\nThis will not be the only distribution to the Juno community. As noted in our [$DAO Tokenomics blog post](https://medium.com/@dao-dao/dao-757c872df4ac):\n\n> \"In the future, we expect to perform token swaps with many DAOs. We imagine that those DAOs will frequently vote to distribute some or all of those $DAO tokens to their members. In that world, we expect the “airdrop” of $DAO tokens will be an ongoing, organic process.\"\n\nIn other words, to incentivize the creation of interesting DAOs on Juno, we will be swapping tokens with the best DAOs emerging on Juno (as determined by the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q)).

If Juno governance does not authorize an extension by passing a new signaling proposal, the 1M JUNO will be withdrawn and returned to the community pool on May 1st, 2024.\n\nJustification\n-------------\n\nRecently, JUNO was approved as collateral on Umee. This was a hugely significant development for JUNO. For the first time, it gave JUNO holders an alternative to selling. Now, JUNO holders can access the equity of their JUNO without selling, simply by using Umee to borrow USDC against JUNO.\n\nHowever, unstaked JUNO forfeits its staking rewards when collateralized. Given the high JUNO staking reward, this is a major disincentive to borrowing against JUNO. \n\nThe solution to this problem is liquid staking. If Umee supported liquid staked JUNO, then users would be able to borrow against their JUNO without forfeiting staking rewards. This would likely increase the popularity of borrowing against JUNO and thereby decrease sell pressure.\n\nBut in order for stJUNO to be supported by Umee, Umee contributors have determined that at least 1M of JUNO liquidity is needed in the stJUNO/JUNO stableswap pool on Osmosis. This liquidity is needed so that the pool can serve as a reliable oracle for the price of stJUNO while at the same time absorb potential stJUNO liquidations.\n\nStride and Osmosis\n------------------\n\nStride's liquid staked token of JUNO, stJUNO, launched in October of 2023. To give the Juno community a voice in the Stride DAO, 200,000 STRD was airdropped to JUNO stakers. Since the launch of stJUNO, its supply has steadily increased, suggesting that JUNO holders believe stJUNO to be useful and trust-worthy. \n\nStride prioritizes security over all else. The Stride codebase has been independently audited by three security firms, and receives continuous auditing from Informal Systems. The Stride blockchain is on track to adopt interchain security, which would increase its economic security by more than 100x. And to mitigate any potential issue, the Stride chain uses IBC rate-limiting.\n\nTurning to Osmosis, it is the most suitable place for this 1M of JUNO liquidity for two main reasons. First, Umee's oracle implementation is currently configured for Osmosis. This means that Osmosis liquidity pools can serve as oracles for tokens listed on Umee, but liquidity pools on other DEXes currently cannot. Second, Osmosis has a stableswap pool type, making it an ideal place for an LST pool. As opposed to constant product, the stableswap pool type utilizes liquidity much more efficiently.\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nIf this proposal passes, it will release 1M JUNO from the community pool to a subDAO / multisig controlled by these trusted community members:\n\n- Rarma (C-2)\n- Brandon (Umee)\n- John (Stride)\n- Dimi (C-1)\n- Reece (C-2)\n\nYou can check the multisig on DaoDao: https://daodao.zone/it/dao/juno15y8mzyzyksw2wzfcv5d67j5pzxzwj0n00agt5kk08mqwykqamheqgvsd9l/proposals\n\nThe multisig signers have bound themselves to follow this set of instructions. Multisig signers will:\n\n1. Liquid stake 500K JUNO with Stride protocol, resulting in a certain amount of stJUNO.\n2. Provide the remaining 500K JUNO along with the full stJUNO amount to the JUNO/stJUNO (# 817) liquidity pool on Osmosis.\n3. Leave the liquidity in the pool, and do nothing else with it.\n4. If Juno governance does not make a signaling proposal to extend the term of this liquidity position, withdraw the 1M JUNO from the liquidity pool and return it to the Juno community pool on May 1st, 2024.\n5. If Juno governance passes any signaling proposal at any time containing instructions for the multisig regarding the 1M JUNO liquidity position, then promptly follow those instructions.\n\nFinal thoughts\n--------------\n\nThere's currently ~15M JUNO in the community pool. Deploying 1M of that liquidity to the stJUNO/JUNO pool to enable stJUNO collateralization on Umee would be a very good deal for the Juno community. None of the 1M JUNO would be spent in any way, and would always remain under the control of the Juno community. With stJUNO listed on Umee, JUNO holders would have a good alternative to selling - they would be able to borrow against their JUNO without forfeiting any staking rewards.\n\nIf this vote passes and the 1M is provided to the stJUNO Osmosis pool, an Umee governance proposal to enable stJUNO collateralization on Umee will quickly be made. And Umee contributors are confident that such a proposal would pass.",0.010666518311863752],["Juno Upgrade: v15\n\n# Juno TokenFactory Upgrade (v15)\n\nThis upgrade brings the following major changes to Juno Network:\n- New TokenFactory DenomCreationGasConsume parameter (2 million gas consumption to create a new token)\n- Cleanup for the next release (SDK v47)\n\nThis change is required for DeFi contract developers for a simpler UX when using the tokenfactory in their contracts.\n\n---\n\n\n## Voting Options\n\nYES: Agree to proceed with Juno v15 network upgrade.\n\nNO: Disagree with the Juno v15 network upgrade.\n\nNO WITH VETO: Disagree with the Juno v15 network upgrade and want depositors penalized.\n\nABSTAIN: Decline to give an opinion on the Juno v15 network upgrade.\n\n",0.0007245524160538105],["Increase Network Fees\n\n# Increase Minimum Gas Prices\n\n[Commonwealth thread](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/11088-param-change-increase-gas-prices)\n\nWith the previous v14 Juno upgrade, Fees are now controlled through governance.\n\nThis proposes we multiply the current gas rates by x3 for ATOM and 30x for JUNO due to current market prices.\n\n*(A slight premium is added to ATOM since JUNO is the native currency of this network.)*\n\n- Current Gas: 0.0025ujuno,0.001uatom\n- New Gas:\t 0.0750ujuno,0.003uatom\n\n---\n\n## Reasons\n\n- Juno's cost per transaction is extremely cheap relative to network activity.

This makes it possible to transfer ETH or any ERC20 token from Peggy to JunoSwap, enabling such pairs as JUNO:ETH and JUNO:RNDR. \n\nIn the very near future, Sifchain will soon upgrade peggy to Omni-EVM, which will enable quick deployment of EVM bridges, and enable token pairs on JunoSwap such as JUNO:NEAR and JUNO:SOL.\n\nBenefits:\nEnabling assets from different, secure bridges, ensures that users of JunoSwap will not be limited by the token-selection of only one bridge. This is relevant because many innovative bridge solutions will launch in Cosmos, and being limited to only one bridge will reduce the amount of assets that can be swapped on JunoSwap – thus sending users elsewhere to make swaps.  \n\nWhile it has been argued by other DEXes that this makes UX unpleasant, there are many work arounds to this. For example, truly permissionless listings for all assets have not stopped UniSwap from achieving over $10B in TVL. Improvements to UX are as simple as implementing a manage-tokens toggle (appended below).    \n\nIf this Proposal Passes:\nThe community supports the permissionless listing of assets that come from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge. \n\nAdditional Information  :\nIn order to ensure that conflicts-of-interest do not play a role in the outcomes of this proposal, we would encourage any validators that have a vested interest in the success of another bridge and choose to vote to:  \n\na) state their biases\n b) abstain\n\nAppendix:\nSifchain Audits:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1kkjdpNuRmTjaiIKA6CQISavCvj4Awpbc\n\nUniswap UX Flow: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JrjhvAVZwa5jxNeBvOKIfSIY2i1sJyf1yaN-s5yUJ64/edit?usp=sharing",0.3446327899409123],["Harmony Proposal to end FUD\n\nThis is a signaling proposal offering a compromise to the problems presented in [Prop 4](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/4) and [Prop 16](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/16).\n\nCCN clients have agreed in advance by majority to support this compromise.\n\nBy voting YES, the Juno stakers voice their support\n\n- To split All JUNO including staking rewards in [the address](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8) equally between the \"Community\" (50%) and \"CCN Clients\" (50%)\n\nThe funds will be allocated as follows:\n- The \"Community Portion\" of JUNO allocated to a smart contract governed by the community.

The DAO’s first product, [Førecast](https://forecast.deliverdao.org), launched successfully in November 2022 and has facilitated over 40k JUNO in volume in over 4,500 rounds on the platform. Førecast is a predictions market which sells binary options (“up” or “down” bets) on the underlying asset.\n\nNow CzarDAO seeks to expand its options offerings by building an options vault on Cosmos based on [Ribbon finance’s](https://docs.ribbon.finance/) option vaults. Ribbon finance has long dominated the DeFi option space since its launch, in large part because it operates in a ‘set it and forget it’ fashion where users can earn real yield on their assets without having to constantly monitor their positions. With a quickly growing and vibrant set of assets native to Cosmos via IBC, there is a real need for this type of DeFi primitive.\n\nWith our experience, we are excited to propose, build, ship and open source a DeFi Option Vaults dApp to the Juno Network!\n\n### Product Details\n\nThis proposal contains 6 milestones, beginning with the submission and acceptance of this proposal. Upon completion of the 6 milestones contained in this proposal CzarDAO will furnish a complete product offering access to yield-bearing vaults that sell covered calls with weekly expiries on the vault’s assets. CzarDAO will provide and maintain the UI, infrastructure and indexers to power a simple and wonderful user experience for this project.\n\nIn accordance with [Prop 64](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/64) all smart-contracts will released as open-source and furnished to the Juno community through the [CzarDAO GitHub](https://github.com/czar-dao).\n\n### Grant Details and Timeline\n\nFunds will be distributed after completion of each milestone via Juno Growth Fund.\n\nWe expect that this project will take us 4~5 months from the passage of this proposal to mainnet with a request of 75k USD equivalent in JUNO. Additionally, we will give the Juno Growth Fund wallet 20,000 CZAR to be staked (10% of current staked, so the SubDAO wallet will get 10% of all CzarDAO-wide revenue). That way as the wallet receives real yield, we can contribute to funding future development on Juno.\n\n\n#### Milestone 1: Proposal and Project Start\n\n+ 15k released to bootstrap smart-contract development\n\n#### Milestone 2: Smart Contracts\n\n+ Time: approx 4-6 weeks, 15k Released\n+ Gnosis/Batch Auction Contract implementation\n+ Option Vault Contract implementation\n+ Scripts to deploy and simulate protocol on Local Testnet\n\n#### Milestone 3: MVP w/ UI\n\n+ Time: approx 4 weeks, 15k Released\n+ UI MVP Hooking into the option contracts\n+ Deposit, Withdrawal, Chart, Auction\n+ Main functionality\n\n#### Milestone 4: Feature Complete and Beautifying\n\n+ Time: approx 4 weeks, 15k Released\n+ Polishing UI\n+ Indexer for User History + Vault Performance + APY\n+ Akash Hosting\n+ Public Testnet Deployment\n\n#### Milestone 5: Open Sourced + Mainnet Launch\n\n+ Time: approx 2-4 weeks, 5k Released\n+ Open-source\n+ Testing, testing, testing\n+ Mainnet deployment\n+ Documentation\n\n#### Milestone 6: 150k TVL Success Metric\n\n+ Time: approx 4-8 weeks, \n+ 10k used to bootstrap Vault TVL\n+ Creation of DAO with key stakeholders to manage vault funds\n+ Upon reaching 150k TVL, vault funds are unlockable by the team \n\n75K USD on Jan 16 at $1.23 is 61k Juno.

In addition to on-demand streaming, we will be focusing on discovery, and radio is a great way to make that process effortless. \n \n Juno Community \n \n How will our project benefit the broader Juno Community? \n \n As a decentralized music streaming platform built on the Juno blockchain, AmigoSound could benefit the broader JUNO community by providing a new and innovative use case for the technology. By utilizing the speed, security, and decentralization of the Juno blockchain, AmigoSound could demonstrate the potential of the platform in the music industry and potentially attract more artists and fans to the Juno ecosystem. \n \n AmigoSound’s decision to build its platform on the JUNO network will benefit the broader Juno community in a number of ways. \n \n Additionally, the use of JUNO on the AmigoSound platform will increase the overall adoption and use of the network, which can help to increase the value of the JUNO token. \n \n The allocation of 10% of the total $AMIGO token supply to JUNO stakers through an airdrop is also going to benefit the Juno community by providing additional value to its members and incentivizing them to hold and use JUNO. \n \n ### Grant Details and Timeline \n \n  [Grant amount link](https://amigosound.gitbook.io/proposal-for-amigosound-project/funding-proposal/grant-amount) \n \n AmigoSound is asking for a total of 50.000 JUNO (at the last month's price of 2$) from the Juno community to support development costs for our music ecosystem project. \n \n The requested amount we are asking represents 0.3% of the total Juno Community Pool. \n \n This is to be released gradually, based on project development and milestone progress. \n \n The milestone system enables a social contract between us and the Juno community.

Currently, StakeEasy has a total value locked (TVL) of 109,000 $JUNO tokens which has been raised organically.\n\n# Benefits\n\n1. This bootstraps the adoption of LSD assets on Juno as a whole which will drive tremendous value and TVL to Juno from other projects and ecosystems. The proposal will result in the overall development of the Juno ecosystem, with StakeEasy and Wynd DEX both benefiting from increased liquidity.\n\n2. The Juno community pool currently holds 16,067,447 $JUNO. This is losing 20% of its value this year due to the inflation rate. Half will be staked as seJUNO which enables the community pool to earn revenue.\n\n3. There will be no negative price impact to JUNO because it is a seJUNO/JUNO pair which creates no sell pressure.\n\n4. The Juno community will retain full control over these assets. There will be extremely limited IL due to the setup of the Staking Swap pool.\n\n5. The establishment of deep liquidity in the seJUNO/JUNO pool paves the way for vast DeFi opportunities on Juno and is expected to drive more LSD and DeFi adoption through current and future project synergies.\n\n6. We believe that our proposal is a win-win situation for everyone involved. By supporting our proposal, you will be contributing to the growth and development of the Juno ecosystem. We hope that you will consider our proposal and support us in this endeavor.\n\n# About stakeEasy\n\n1. **Reliable and Trustworthy**: StakeEasy has been live on the Juno network for months and has proven to be a reliable and effective staking platform reaching a TVL of 400K $JUNO a few months back.\n\n2. **Low Fees**: StakeEasy charges comparatively low fees i.e. 5%, making it a more attractive option for staking JUNO and the organic growth speaks volumes about our reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n3. **Strong Presence on DEXes and other DeFi**: StakeEasy had a strong presence on the Juno Network's decentralized exchange (DEX) JunoSwap, with pools ranked in the top 10 in terms of liquidity. However, after JunoSwap's failure, the liquidity has been migrated to Wynd DEX. With that we have liquidity pools on Loop DEX as well.\n\n4. **Partnership Opportunities**: StakeEasy is open to collaborating with other projects and protocols in the Juno ecosystem, which can result in more opportunities for growth and development. However, there is still much more that can be done to strengthen the ecosystem and promote further growth.\n\n5. **Open source**: The source code for the stakeEasy liquid staking contract is open-source and can be found [here](https://github.com/arufa-research/stakeeasy-juno-contracts). These contracts have been extensively tested with unit/integration tests and been battle tested on juno's mainnet for last 8 months. The integration tests can be found [here](https://github.com/arufa-research/stakeeasy-juno-contracts/tree/master/test).\n\n6. **Upcoming gauges system**: The stakeEasy dev team is in testing phase on the new gauge based validator selection system which futher decentralizes the validator set selected for liquid staking.\n\n# Plan of action\n\nCommunity pool tokens from Juno will be sent to a seJUNO/JUNO PoL multi-sig address that will then allocate token to the liquidity pools.

We plan on being the premiere price oracle for Juno and the rest of the Cosmos; 60+ assets will be added to these feeds over the course of time, many of which will be cosmos-native assets such as liquid staking tokens, stablecoins, and LP tokens. This also includes our Historacle offering, which provides contextual data about these price feeds for DeFi dApps to make safer decisions on the types of transactions to allow. This has become very expensive due to the recent gas changes on Juno with Proposal 297. \n Ojo is requesting that Juno waives our gas fees for price feed transactions to the following contract, up to 5,000,000 gas per transaction: juno1yqm8q56hjv8sd4r37wdhkkdt3wu45gc5ptrjmd9k0nhvavl0354qwcf249 \n If this proposal passes, Juno leadership has agreed to implement and include this change in the next chain upgrade. \n\n ## Yes \n Vote YES on this proposal to support waiving gas fees for Ojo price feed updates. \n ## No \n Vote NO on this proposal to oppose waiving gas fees for Ojo price feed updates. \n\n References \n Juno Contract to be whitelisted: https://www.mintscan.io/juno/wasm/contract/juno1yqm8q56hjv8sd4r37wdhkkdt3wu45gc5ptrjmd9k0nhvavl0354qwcf249 \n Ojo Deployment Announcement: https://twitter.com/ojo_network/status/1666173196117188609?s=20 \n Original twitter thread with Reece: https://twitter.com/wozchain/status/1666514198480973825?s=20 \n Ojo Network docs: https://docs.ojo.network/integrate \n Ojo GitHub: https://github.com/ojo-network \n Ojo Whitepaper: https://github.com/ojo-network/ojo/blob/main/whitepaper.pdf \n",0.3444336476869803],["Enable Transactions Param Change\n\nEnable transactions",0.0],["Kava Incentives Proposal\n\nCreate a user growth pool that will be funded via inflationary monetary policy.

Summary of Facts\n\n1. [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/graphs/contributors) is a Go module that bridges the Cosmos APIs (Cosmos SDK, Tendermint, IBC, etc) to EVM (using the [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) library as module). It is the de-facto way to have EVM-powered Cosmos chains.\n2. Ethermint is developed and maintained by Tharsis & other contributors & volunteers.\n3. [Kava](https://www.kava.io/) is \"One Network. Two Chains. Ethereum and Cosmos.\"\n4. Kava is today valued at ~$400M market cap\n5. Estimated Total Value Locked on Kava Co-Chains: $291M (Cosmos TVL: $274M, EVM TVL: $17M). [Source](https://defillama.com/chain/Kava).\n6. EVM support [was announced by Kava Labs on Aug 26, 2021](https://medium.com/kava-labs/kava-labs-announces-the-rebranding-of-kava-product-portfolio-68a9353f4d1c), in The Kava Product Roadmap diagram. \"Kava 9 also implements several core infrastructural changes, paving the way for EVM support in H1 2022\".\n7. \"Kava Rise Program: $750M Developer Incentive Program. The structure of the Rise program will focus primarily on driving adoption and growth for the new Ethereum Co-Chain.\"\n8. Kava Community Pool has ~80M KAVA tokens\n9. Kava uses Ethermint for their Ethereum Co-Chain and Cosmos SDK for Cosmos in [their code](https://github.com/Kava-Labs)\n10. Tharsis made [this Commonwealth proposal](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6684-external-evm-infrastructure-funding-proposal-on-kava) to the Evmos and Kava communities, \"requesting 3M out of ~80M KAVA tokens (3.7%) from the Kava Community Pool Treasury to fund, develop and advance critical EVM Infrastructure through the Ethermint Engineering and R&D team for 1 year.\", followed by opening a [Kava Community Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/wsa37v/evm_infrastructure_funding_proposal_on_kava/). Resulting in the formal [on-chain Kava proposal #96](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/96)\n11. Proposal #96 was rejected. 13/21 of the top validators votes YES, 1/21 voted ABSTAIN, and 7/21 did not vote. The top 21 validators have 88.90% voting power. Kava's co-founder & CEO's [response](https://twitter.com/Scott_Stuart_/status/1563228443436728321).\n12. Kava Labs made its own \"Kava Infrastructure Security rewards\" [proposal #97](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/97), with no mention of funding Ethermint, as critical infrastructure. With no link to any Kava Community discussion. This proposal passed.\n13. \"The Kava DAO is a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Kava Network. Made up of the Kava stakers and validators that help to secure and run the network\"\n14. Kava did not make any concrete offers to reward past development efforts for Ethermint (not even future development efforts).\n15.

Votes\n\nIf you vote YES: you agree to reward Ethermint past development efforts with the agreed-upon amount.\n\n## Proposal Lead\n\nThis proposal was led on behalf of the Evmos Community, by Loredana Cirstea - elected by vote in the Evmos Interchain Office (Evmos Governance proposal #45) and a volunteer from [The Laurel Project](https://evolve.provable.dev/). This proposal is made from a volunteer capacity (independent, unpaid, self-funded, and from the heart).\n",0.3078663471937304],["Revive IBC Client to Oppy Chain\n\n## Summary\n\nThrough accepting this proposal, the expired IBC Tendermint client' 07-tendermint-15' will be revived (or activated) to interconnect the Cosmos SDK blockchains kava_2222-10 (i.e., Kava mainnet) and oppyChain-1 (i.e., Oppy Chain mainnet).\n\n\n## Current Situation\n\nTo be trustworthy, the consensus state of these clients needs to be periodically updated by IBC relayers. However, if the relayers seize their work or the relying chain is terminated, the clients can expire due to their out-of-date consensus state and will be frozen. After being frozen, updating the consensus state of the expired client becomes impossible. As a result, transferring assets through the corresponding channel become impossible and the asset transferred through the channel will be 'frozen' as well.\nIn our case, due to our misconfiguration used to create the client, the client expired and the asset transferred through the corresponding channel was frozen. \n\n\n## Solution\n\nThe ibc-go implementation of the IBC protocol in the Kava Chain exposes a type of governance proposal (i.e., update-client) that enables a community to reactivate an expired/frozen Tendermint client. When such a proposal passes, the state of another (but active and updateable) Tendermint client, which is available on both chains gets copied into the expired client, thus reactivating the expired one. It is to establish this reactivation function that this governance proposal is about.\n\n\n## Governance Votes\n\nYES = The canonical Tendermint client 07-tendermint-15, which interconnects oppyChain-1 (Oppy Chain) and kava_2222-10 will get updated with the state of another active Tendermint client (07-tendermint-49).\nNO = The Tendermint client 07-tendermint-15 remains expired/frozen.

Proposal #2 for initiation of liquidity mining incentives for bonded liquidity providers passed on 2021-06-23 16:52 UTC. Prior to Proposal #2 passing, the Osmosis Team issued the following message: \"Note that users can begin bonding their LP tokens even though liquidity incentives haven’t been enabled yet, and their first LP reward will be distributed at 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC.\"\nDiscord link: https://discord.com/channels/798583171548840026/842477665860583434/856777198442774569\nSkylink: https://skygallery.hns.skyportal.xyz/#/a/AABDv3g-2RYw1FbuF8BDn2yKyjS_5jMOrSVkS-KdWTQfoQ\n\nBased upon that and other messages, the community (including the Osmosis Team) believed that ELPs would receive their portion of the newly initiated liquidity mining rewards at the close of that epoch. ELPs assumed significant risk by providing liquidity and bonding their tokens at a time when overall liquidity on Osmosis was a small fraction of what it is today. Unfortunately, ELPs received no rewards for their service. The Osmosis Team acknowledges this miscommunication and recommended that the community submit a governance proposal to distribute the rewards from the community pool to ELPs. ELPs experienced substantial impermanent loss, price slippage, and lost opportunity cost of capital. ELPs rightfully expected liquidity rewards for these risks by providing the earliest and most important liquidity on the platform, especially considering the miscommunication from the Osmosis Team. Instead, ELPs performed worse than those who retained liquid capital and bonded later when there was less risk, less slippage and more volume (at the expense of ELPs). This result is inequitable and contrary to the ethos of Osmosis.\n\nShould this proposal pass, the liquidity rewards will be distributed to applicable recipients from the community pool after a future software upgrade performed by the Osmosis Team. We thank you for your consideration.\n\nNote:\nThis proposal is a revision of proposal #11, which proposed to distribute 20% of the rewards to current LPs. Following discussions with community members (particularly on Discord), a strong opinion was that a 20% concession would set a bad precedent. The issue is that, regardless of what the intention is, rewarding other LPs in this context is essentially vote buying.

The exact percentage depends on details of how many validators were counted as online at the epoch block. This is an unfair system for a number of reasons, and introduces a force to centralize stake amongst the validators who already have the most stake. This is because:\n\n1. (In theory) The chance of a validator being the proposer is proportional to their stake, which means you have the same expected return, but lower variance with larger validators. This gives an incentive to delegate to the largest validators. (There is a similar effect in POW mining systems like Bitcoin, which leads to pools)\n2. In practice, the chance of a validator being the epoch proposer is 0 if they are not in the top 66% (by stake) of fastest validators. Only the validators who finish computing the block first will be potential proposers for it. This also contributes to centralization, as the largest validators can most afford to maximize their speed.\n3. The proposer selection algorithm is not based on secure randomness, it isn’t even random at all. It is in fact highly manipulable. There are known strategies validator operators could use to attempt to propose a specific block. Actual usage of these strategies could be considered byzantine behavior, and could lead to further network instability around the epoch time.\n\nThis centralization effect is harmful to the long term success of the network – we want the stake distribution to become much less top heavy. Stake distribution has been decentralizing nicely as time has gone in the network, but it would be ideal to further accelerate this decentralization. And whats critical to that, is at minimum, lowering the incentive for the stake to centralize at the top. We are nowhere near the end state yet for stake distribution!\n\n--Short Term Suggestion--\n\nCreate a parameter change proposal to set the proposer bonus to 0%. This would then go into affect immediately after the proposal passes.\n\n--Long Term Suggestion--\n\nThis is definitely a conversation that needs to be designed together over time!\nTalking with @UnityChaos & @dogemos, we thought it’d be cool to re-introduce this proposer bonus lottery, but have it only be applicable to the bottom {say} 50 validators. Also have the total pot of the reward not be 5%, but instead be around {say} 1% of the reward. This would help incentivize decentralization of the network, and also retain the (accidentally introduced) lottery effect that so many folks like! (Since delegating to smaller validators would be higher EV!)\n\nIt is possible that higher stake validators sybil themselves into multiple lower stake validators. The hope is that the pot here is sufficiently low, that this won’t be worth the reputational hit that the sybilling validator would take. (And would also cause community uproar, justifying a governance proposal to slash them) There is still a fear that the big validator makes multiple sybils anonymously, this is quite plausible if its all their own funds. Noticeability only really comes in when its from validators gathering delegations from users, or are trying to build a common brand.\n\nThe blocker for re-introducing this epoch reward lottery this is we need a secure on-chain randomness source. (In addition to design work to ensure sybilling incentivizes are sufficiently low) This can be added as a follow-on to the threshold decryption work that is being worked on. The threshold decryption work eliminates most of the known forms of MEV learned about from Ethereum, such as front-running, sandwitching, stealing arbs, etc. – making them unable to applied on Osmosis once its done.

It brings with it faster epochs, and improved computation time for various on-chain operations, and fixes to the high gas amounts needed for bonding and unbonding txs.\n\n\n\nThe features of this upgrade are:\n\n\n\n* Fixing gas issues for bonding and unbonding tokens (NOTE: issues at epoch of there just being super high amounts of activity may still persist, with it taking seconds for txs to get into a block)\n\n* Removing the need for users to withdraw locked tokens once they are finished unlocking\n\n* Adding a governance parameter for a minimum fee to create a pool.\n\n* Implements prop 12\n\n\n\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v4.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n\n\n### Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\n\n\nFollow the cosmovisor setup instructions here: https://github.com/osmosis-labs/networks/blob/main/osmosis-1/upgrades/cosmovisor.md\n\n\n\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the osmosisd v4.0.0 binary to .osmosisd/cosmovisor/v4/bin/.\n\n\n\n### Details of upgrade time\n\n\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine of the Osmosis will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to v4.0.0, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\n\n\nThe proposal sets the upgrade proposal block at #1314500, which\n\nis anticipated to be at Friday 2PM UTC (10AM EST). This is figured using the 7 day average block time of 6.45 seconds per block. Note that block times are highly variable, and this time estimate could very well be off by a couple of hours, due to live network conditions.\n\n\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\n\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node.

Due to unprecedented demand, we are going to expand the conference for an additional day, turning it into a two-day conference from November 5-6.\n\nObjective\nCosmoverse is held to raise awareness of Cosmos and its vibrant ecosystem. Hundreds of Cosmonauts from all over the world will unite to learn and network at Cosmoverse.\nThe team:\n\nCosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.\n\nDuring late October and early November, Lisbon is going to be full with Crypto-specific events and conferences.\n\nCosmoverse takes place in between ETH Lisbon and Solana, which means that attendees from these events will have the opportunity to join us, too.\n\nLivestream\nFor those that are unable to attend, there will be a livestream broadcasting of the event, in collaboration with OmniFlix. A professional camera setup and videographers are already arranged. We will create specific in-stream content in advance to provide a seamless experience for online-viewers.\nEvent Highlights\nCosmoverse is organized by the community, for the community. We managed to onboard reputable speakers from the Cosmos ecosystem, such as Sunny Aggarwal, Billy Rennekamp, Alessio Treglia, Federico Kunze-Küllmer, Brent Xu, Gregory Landua or Felix Lutsch, but also high-profile speakers from the broader Cryptoverse such as Meltem Demirors, Tegan Kline, Marc Zeller and more.\n\nAs we get closer to the event, we will try to embed more exciting things that will make Cosmoverse a great success. Follow us on Twitter and join the chat on Telegram to stay up-to-date and STAY TUNED :)\n\n\nBudget & post-conference report\n\nIf this proposal passes, 4,000 OSMO (worth ~ $20,000 as of today according to Coingecko) will be allocated to help make this event a great success.\n\nThe lead sponsor for the conference is the Cosmos Hub with marketing funds from proposal #46 “Luna Mission,” but we require additional resources to pay for:\nAudio visuals / logistics\nDay 2 venue + catering\n\nAfterparty\nPrinting banners\nMarketing materials\nOnline marketing and coverage\nWe are going to publish a detailed report on the budget-spent after the conference occurred. Given that Cosmoverse was just an idea ~5 weeks ago and things are moving incredibly fast, the cost and budget planning is one of the hardest tasks for us at the moment.\n\nIn addition, given that we are just a team of 6-enthusiastic Cosmonauts without a company that could bail us out, we need to be incredibly cautious with our finances and avoid illiquidity.\n\nThe main cost-factors for this event (for 320 people) are:\nVenue incl. catering: ~ $36,500 per day\nAV + branding: ~ $34,200 total\nAfterparty: ~ $20,000\nAdditional expenses: tbd\nTeam expenses: tbd\nTeam compensation: tbd\n\nThe cost for the venue would increase by ~$19,000 per day if we could host 500 guests instead of 320.\n\nIn case there is going to be a profit left, we plan to use this as starting liquidity for the next Cosmoverse conference.\n\nCurrent sponsors are:\nCosmos Hub community pool ($34,000)\nCitizen Cosmos ($5,000)\nStargaze ($5,000)\nSentinel ($5,000)\nRegen Network ($5,000)\nUmee ($5,000)\ne-Money ($5,000)\nCommercio ($5,000)\n\nCosmoverse is a community-effort that is financed in a hybrid manner by companies and DAOs. The first one ever? In the future, we envision Cosmoverse to become a fully DAO-funded endeavor that will take place annually.\n\n\nTickets\nThe goal is also to keep the ticket prices extremely affordable (from 39€) which is very competitive to other crypto-conferences happening in Lisbon around the same time (tickets cost up to €1,000). The ticket also includes F&B throughout both days at the conference as well as access and F&B at the afterparty venue. Our goal is to provide as much value as possible for attending Cosmonauts, while also investing funds into media coverage to provide high-quality, free broadcasting of the event. Each presentation will also be recorded and published on Youtube.\n\nThe Osmosis core team has been an early proponent and supporter of Cosmoverse and is also receiving exposure at the event.\nIf the proposal is accepted, Osmosis will become a sponsor of Cosmoverse 2021.\n\nThis includes:\nOnline and print visibility\nKeynote slot on Day 1 (presentation by Josh Lee)\nPanel slot on Day 2 (topic + panelists tbd)\n1x high table at the conference in the exhibition area\n1x stand up banner placed in the networking area\nPromotion in relevant news outlets",0.0019061984488096446],["Increase Pool Creation Fee to 100 osmo\n\nWith the passage of Prop 38 and the successful integration of the Osmosis v4: Berylium Upgrade, the pool creation fee chain parameter has been added to Osmosis.

Such as the previous program by Akash, current one by E-Money, and proposed one by Juno https://juno.aneka.io/proposals/1\n\nUnder the current process, new pool creators are asked to create Text Proposals so that we can come to consensus about whether or not these pools should begin receiving Osmo incentives following the Prop 13 model and on-boarding process.\n\nUnder the proposed new process, pool creators would create Text Proposals asking for governance agreement to add the pools to the model, but also to match a certain amount of external incentives that they plan to provide. For an approved pool with external incentives, the model would set a minimum incentive share with Osmo to match the USD value of the external incentives.\n\nThese incentive matches would be decided by governance on a case by case basis, and should be limited to some overall % of Osmo Incentives. I propose that we start with a soft limit of 20% of incentives, so matching no more than ~400,000 USD per day of external incentives.\n\nI also propose that we begin by matching the external incentives currently being paid by E-Money to pools 461, and 482. As well as the proposed Juno incentives on pools 497, and 498. These external incentives amount to a total of ~36,000 USD per day, or 1.9% of incentives at current prices.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, we will begin using the new spreadsheet for regular adjustment proposals starting October 11th 2021, and these pools will have their external incentives at least matched.\n\nIf this proposal is not approved, we will continue with the Prop 13 model without matching.

All existing pools and GAMM shares will retain their current numbers and new pools will continue to be created by incrementing the current max pool number.\n\nNOTE : Any GAMM shares which are IBC'd out of Osmosis would be STUCK if not brought back over to Osmosis before this cleanup!\n\n\n*****Proposal*****\n\nVote YES -- to signal approval to state cleanup & refund all pools under $1k TVL\nVote NO  -- to signal dissent and NOT alter state to cleanup any low TVL pools\n\n\n*****Commonwealth Discussion*****\nhttps://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/2047-proposal-raise-the-pool-creation-fee-and-refund-pools-with-less-than-1000-tvl\n\n*****Osmosis Github Issue*****\nhttps://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/502",0.002037539705024738],["Semi-Automatic Incentive Adjustments for 12/05/2021\n\nAdjustment Proposal in accordance with model of Prop 54 \n\n Static copy of spreadsheet with data used to generate proposal: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weXZw5AJo3NSAmXyKOLEdqG_ZOzUijEHDUSImOCpR1c/edit?usp=sharing\n\nScale parameter changed to 15% as per prop 80\nBegin onboarding for BTSG, BOOT, and CMDX pools\nContinued onboarding of SCRT, XKI, and MED pools\nExternal incentive matching for MED pools\nReposted to include CMDX/OSMO pool 601\n\n\nCurrent Shares:\n\n1, 34.6753%\n2, 0.7246%\n3, 2.6160%\n4, 1.8557%\n5, 4.1259%\n6, 3.0910%\n7, 1.2041%\n8, 0.5238%\n9, 3.9216%\n10, 2.7021%\n13, 1.6562%\n15, 1.3506%\n22, 0.7676%\n42, 0.7866%\n183, 0.0347%\n197, 0.0274%\n461, 0.1884%\n463, 0.0382%\n464, 0.0148%\n481, 1.1864%\n482, 0.7347%\n497, 4.5893%\n498, 3.2686%\n548, 0.0410%\n549, 0.0021%\n553, 0.0884%\n555, 0.0126%\n557, 0.0906%\n558, 0.0387%\n560, 11.8565%\n561, 8.3705%\n562, 4.0893%\n565, 0.0750%\n567, 0.1286%\n571, 0.2827%\n572, 0.2350%\n573, 0.0000%\n574, 0.0000%\n577, 1.0788%\n578, 0.1330%\n579, 0.0370%\n584, 1.5401%\n585, 0.6828%\n586, 0.0746%\n587, 0.0594%\n592, 0.0000%\n596, 0.0000%\n597, 0.0000%\n600, 0.0000%\n601, 0.0000%\n\n\nProposed Shares:\n\n\n1, 35.3287%\n2, 0.8060%\n3, 2.1508%\n4, 1.5257%\n5, 3.3923%\n6, 2.5414%\n7, 0.9900%\n8, 0.4307%\n9, 3.8801%\n10, 2.2216%\n13, 1.3617%\n15, 1.1104%\n22, 0.6311%\n42, 0.6467%\n183, 0.0285%\n197, 0.0225%\n461, 0.1549%\n463, 0.0425%\n464, 0.0165%\n481, 1.3197%\n482, 0.6041%\n497, 3.7771%\n498, 2.6874%\n548, 0.0456%\n549, 0.0022%\n553, 0.0727%\n555, 0.0104%\n557, 0.0745%\n558, 0.0318%\n560, 13.1890%\n561, 9.3112%\n562, 4.5489%\n565, 0.0834%\n567, 0.1431%\n571, 0.2926%\n572, 0.1932%\n573, 0.0783%\n574, 0.0474%\n577, 0.8037%\n578, 0.0973%\n579, 0.0136%\n584, 2.2068%\n585, 0.7888%\n586, 0.2605%\n587, 0.2260%\n592, 0.0188%\n596, 0.0403%\n597, 0.0491%\n600, 0.6957%\n601, 0.0045%\n",0.014862660204446043],["Match CMDX External Incentives for Pools 600 and 601\n\nBackground\nAs established in Osmosis Proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.\n\n** Proposal Details** \nMatch external incentives provided by the Comdex team for CMDX/ATOM (pool 600) and CMDX/OSMO (pool 601).

The timing of this upgrade is crucial to properly execute the [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) airdrop clawback. This clawback should happen right at the Airdrop end date of December 15th 5PM UTC, thus this upgrade must execute before it. \n\nThe upgrade block height `2383300` is estimated to be at December 14th, UTC 2:30PM. Block times have high variance, so please be monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \n\n## Upgrade features\n\nThis upgrade adds features such as:\n\n- Upgrade Cosmos-SDK to [SDK v0.44](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) from SDK v0.42 For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see its [changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21). Noteable highlights include:\n    - [Authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) - Allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). \n- New modules:\n    - [Bech32IBC](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/bech32-ibc) - Allows auto-routing of send msgs to addresses on other chains, once configured by governance. Allows you to do a bank send on Osmosis to a cosmos1... address, and it is automatically sent to the corresponding Cosmos Hub address over IBC. This is a big step in enabling more seemless IBC UX.\n    - [TxFees](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees) - Enables validators to easily accept txfees in multiple assets, whitelisted by governance, by declaring minimum fees in OSMO.  Alternative fee assets are converted to their OSMO value, using the spot price on their primary OSMO base pair pool.  This upgrade pre-whitelists all the assets currently supported on the Osmosis frontend with an OSMO basepair pool.\n- Implements [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) - Clawback of unclaimed Osmo and Ion on airdrop end date. (December 15th, 5PM UTC)\n- Upgrade IBC from a standalone module in the SDK to [IBC v2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). This improves the utility of Ethereum Bridges and Cosmwasm bridges.\n- Blocking [OFAC banned ETH addresses](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sanctions/1.0/sdn_advanced.xml) \n- Numerous minor bug fixes, gas fixes, and significant speedups.\n\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\nAll nodes will require 32GB of memory. Swap can be used to achieve this, but getting nodes with 32GB RAM is _significantly_ preferred. Furthermore, NVMe SSDs significantly improve the speed of execution.\n\nPlease follow the setup instructions here for how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.x/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v5/guide.md).\n\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you have to install cosmovisor from the SDK v0.42.9 branch) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v5.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin/`.\n\nIf you do not want to use cosmovisor due to cosmovisor reliability issues, please be prepared to upgrade at around 2:30PM UTC, December 14th if this proposal passes.\n\n## Details of upgrade time\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the Osmosis blockchain will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v5.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `2383300`, anticipated to be at `Wednesday December 14th 2:30PM UTC (9:30AM EST)`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.65 seconds per block, derived from Cros-nest dashboard. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 100 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\n",0.0009019312755534173],["Semi-Automatic Incentive Adjustments for 12/12/2021\n\nAdjustment Proposal in accordance with model of Prop 54 \n\n [Static copy of spreadsheet with data used to generate proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JfLGUKFv00fncVTchs8Cw8h1tFfsE976OurYH8Q4F2k/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nBegin onboarding of CHEQ/Osmo\nMatched external incentives for DVPN\nMatched external incentives for BTSG\nMatched external incentives for CMDX\nChanged Scale parameter from 15% to 20%\n\n\nCurrent Shares:\n\n1, 35.3287%\n2, 0.8060%\n3, 2.1508%\n4, 1.5257%\n5, 3.3923%\n6, 2.5414%\n7, 0.9900%\n8, 0.4307%\n9, 3.8801%\n10, 2.2216%\n13, 1.3617%\n15, 1.1104%\n22, 0.6311%\n42, 0.6467%\n183, 0.0285%\n197, 0.0225%\n461, 0.1549%\n463, 0.0425%\n464, 0.0165%\n481, 1.3197%\n482, 0.6041%\n497, 3.7771%\n498, 2.6874%\n548, 0.0456%\n549, 0.0022%\n553, 0.0727%\n555, 0.0104%\n557, 0.0745%\n558, 0.0318%\n560, 13.1890%\n561, 9.3112%\n562, 4.5489%\n565, 0.0834%\n567, 0.1431%\n571, 0.2926%\n572, 0.1932%\n573, 0.0783%\n574, 0.0474%\n577, 0.8037%\n578, 0.0973%\n579, 0.0136%\n584, 2.2068%\n585, 0.7888%\n586, 0.2605%\n587, 0.2260%\n592, 0.0188%\n596, 0.0403%\n597, 0.0491%\n600, 0.6957%\n601, 0.0045%\n602, 0.0000%\n\n\nProposed Shares:\n\n\n1, 35.1224%\n2, 0.8818%\n3, 1.5687%\n4, 1.1128%\n5, 2.4742%\n6, 2.0514%\n7, 0.7221%\n8, 0.3141%\n9, 2.9978%\n10, 1.6204%\n13, 0.9932%\n15, 0.8099%\n22, 0.4603%\n42, 0.4717%\n183, 0.0208%\n197, 0.0164%\n461, 0.1130%\n463, 0.0465%\n464, 0.0153%\n481, 0.9625%\n482, 0.4406%\n497, 3.8243%\n498, 2.4099%\n548, 0.0333%\n549, 0.0016%\n553, 0.0530%\n555, 0.0076%\n557, 0.0543%\n558, 0.0232%\n560, 14.4292%\n561, 10.1867%\n562, 4.9767%\n565, 0.0913%\n567, 0.1565%\n571, 0.2334%\n572, 0.1647%\n573, 0.2391%\n574, 0.2126%\n577, 0.9029%\n578, 0.1118%\n579, 0.0169%\n584, 1.9186%\n585, 0.6052%\n586, 0.3449%\n587, 0.2740%\n592, 0.2126%\n596, 0.0316%\n597, 0.0489%\n600, 2.1669%\n601, 2.0236%\n602, 0.0290%\n",0.013164654263025821],["Proposal for removing OSMO incentives on JUNO / XKI pool\n\nBy voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:\nRemoving OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:\nRemoving OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool on Osmosis.\n\n** Details **\n\nThe following proposal is a special signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to remove XKI/JUNO pair into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.\nRegular XKI/JUNO pool have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.\nA proposal for JUNO incentives that would be matched by XKI incentives has been posted and rejected by the Juno community as it happened to be more controversial than expected: https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/7.\n\nIn order to remain fair to the OSMOSIS community, the Ki Foundation offers to support the removal of OSMO incentives from the JUNO / XKI pools as it has been stated on the live with Cryptocito: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=leY7R217qss.\n\nThis proposal has for sole goal to keep a spirit of fairness towards the Osmosis community, as we will continue building products on the Juno chain and continue our support on making the Cosmos ecosystem a more interoperable space!\n\n** About Ki & Klub **\n\nKi is offering the compliant gateway from the Fiat world to DeFi, through Klub Ki is building DeFi protocols that will live on top of Juno while being operated through interchain accounts of multiple chains.\n\nWebsite: https://foundation.ki\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Ki_Foundation\nKlub App on the stores:\niPhone: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/klub/id1545143892\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ki.foundation.klub&hl=en_US&gl=US\n\n***** OSMOSIS COMMONWEALTH DISCUSSION THREAD*****\nhttps://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/2904-proposal-for-removing-osmo-incentives-on-juno-xki-pool\n",0.00623609440405611],["Stargaze Community Loan and LBP\n\nThis proposal includes the details regarding the loan of OSMO to Stargaze’s multi-sig and the parameters of the LBP. By voting Yes on this proposal will signify approval for both a loan of OSMO to Stargaze, and Stargaze will then launch and LBP with the following parameters with that funding. \nThe request for a loan of 135,000 OSMO (~$724K) from the Osmosis community treasury to a multi-sig controlled by community members.

A 95/5 pool will have 95% of STARS to 5% of OSMO value. Over a period of 3 days, the goal is for the pool to reach 50/50 value.\nLBPs allow teams to build liquidity without a large amount of upfront capital.

Bug details at the end.\\\n\\\nThis proposal suggests doing an emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v6 binary. This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The [v6.0.0 software version](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v6.0.0) is fully state-compatible with `v5.0.0` until the upgrade block `2464000`, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v3 upgrade (prop 17), used when the governance deposit mechanism was broken.\\\n\\\nThe proposed upgrade block height of 2464000 is estimated to be at December 20, 2021, 16:00 UTC (Monday).\\\n\\\nAll validators, and full node operators should update their software to version `v6.0.0` prior to block height 2464000. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\\\n\\\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\\\n\\\n## Actionable(s)\\\n\\\n* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0`, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0.\\\n* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\\\n* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\\\n\\\n## Failure case and risks involved\\\n\\\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - \"validators\" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis)\\\n\\\nNote: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\\\n\\\n## Governance procedure\\\n\\\n A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\\\n A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\\\n\\\nDeposits are intended to be used by validators here.\\\n\\\n- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key. Please do this, even if your validator operator key is behind a multisig. This is a good time to take advantage of authz, to allow easier depositing & voting.\\\n- Once over 66% of voting power has signalled readiness, this upgrade proposal is considered valid.\\\n- Should this proposal fail to gather readiness signalling from two-thirds of voting power by December 20th 4AM UTC, the upgrade proposal should be considered failed and validators should revert to the old binary prior to block 2464000.\\\n\\\n## Testing methodology\\\n\\\nThis upgrade has been tested to be compatible with v5.0.0 until the upgrade height on a testnet. This was done by having a v6.0.0 validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected). The v6.0.0 node could then receive IBC transfers.\\\n\\\n## Bug Details\\\n\\\nRelevant issue: [osmosis-labs/osmosis #665](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/665)\\\n\\\nTL;DR - There was a subtle misconfiguration in the Osmosis app.go. This slipped in from a copy-paste error during the SDK 42 -> 44 upgrade. This manifested in being unable to create new channels.\\\n",0.0010176064709863282],["Semi-Automatic Incentive Adjustments for 12/19/2021\n\nAdjustment Proposal in accordance with model of Prop 54 \n\n Static copy of spreadsheet with data used to generate proposal: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15QwX4WRi5wdsbjY7bI4AFqONM9NYYkhI3rFMBg61K3A/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAdded Pool 580 (Juno/Ust) to onboarding as per Prop 102\nRemoved incentives from pool 579 (Juno/XKI) as per Prop 98\nChanged to displaying current/proposed Osmo per day, instead of incentive shares\nReproposing because of formatting propblems in Prop 104 (and 105 ...

Namely, make external incentive matching follow the same bias factor present in Osmosis. This concretely means that the Osmo-side bonus APY for external incentive ATOM pools will halve.

However, the recent external incentives for STARS, HUAHUA and CMDX, as well as the proposed external ROWAN incentives in #132, have been substantially higher than previous ones. Matching these has resulted in a large amount of the daily Osmosis incentive distribution being used for matching purposes and has had proportionately reduced the APR across other pools without matching incentives.\n A bias to external incentives has been confirmed in Proposal 128. This is not a simple weighting to provide non-Osmosis incentives 50% of the rewards that Osmosis pools do. Instead the weight of non-OSMO pools is decreased by 50% as well as the weight of OSMO pools being raised by 50%.\n As a result of this, on the next semi-automatic incentives proposal, each  of external incentives on non-OSMO pools will not only be matched by bash.50 in OSMO rewards, but would also result in OSMO pools being matched by .50. (In both instances up to the 30% overall cap coming into effect). \n\n This proposal requests that the maximum match for  in external incentives is  in OSMO. \n\n These external incentives have also generated a lot of hype around high APRs, partially funded by Osmosis matching these high external incentives on new pools. This may have caused price increases of these tokens as liquidity providers seek to buy in to pools with higher APRs. In turn causing the price to further increase and therefore requiring even more OSMO to match the, now higher, dollar value of external incentives.\n In order to ensure that the OSMO spent on matching these external incentives is useful for the ecosystem, this proposal requests that a cap on the dollar value of OSMO used for matching be added based on the fees generated by the pool. Fees generated give an indicator of how actively a pool is used and the value that the additional liquidity attracted by this external matching will bring to Osmosis. This cap would be based on the Subsidy Bias model that is in use for normal incentives, promoting the addition of external incentives on OSMO pools and reducing Osmosis' spend on other pools. I.E.  of fees generated in OSMO pools would allow, currently, 3x the dollar amount of OSMO to be available to meet external matching up to the other caps compared to  of fees in a non-OSMO pool.\n\n In short this limits the bonus OSMO APR provided by the incentive matching program to the non-matched APR. \n\n  Whichever of these caps is hit first would be the maximum dollar amount of OSMO that Osmosis uses to match incentives. \n\n Model based on figures from the Semi-Automatic Incentives Proposal #131: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUST7SUkdr3__HgMqfFxItkmTaXhd1Nmsk-Ji0EASNs \n\n Commonwealth Thread on fee based cap: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3578-proposal-external-incentive-matching-caps-on-asset-pairs \n\n Commonwealth Thread on 1:1 matching: https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposal/discussion/3577-proposal-osmo-bias-on-external-incentives-should-not-overmatch-dollar-value/",0.08602033646285816],["Italian Educational Content\n\nWe are requesting a community pool spend to create high-quality educational content about Osmosis for the Italian Proof of Stake community, and help us support the network long term.

UST adoption has to a large extent been driven by shady activities and circumvention of regulation. This includes enticing the wider public to trade regulated products without any consumer protection (Mirror Protocol) and luring savers with high returns without explaining the risk of losing the principal (Anchor Protocol) when/if UST collapses.\n2. Like Stripper Dollars, UST provides no clear benefits compared to \"the real deal\", i.e. a USD backed stablecoin. Only Luna holders benefit from the minting of UST.\n3. Stripper Dollars have a tendency to become worthless overnight. Algorithmic stablecoins have a similar track record.\n\nIs UST really the best USD stablecoin for Osmosis? It seems like we could easily do better by adopting an existing USD backed stablecoin such as USDC.\n\nWhen evaluating the commentary and voting on this proposal, keep in mind that key figures from in the Cosmos ecosystem are heavily invested in Luna and thus have strong economic incentive to see UST and Luna integrated in Osmosis, regardless of risk and long term consequences to the ecosystem.\n\nVoting *YES* on this proposal signal that we, as the broader community,\n\n1.

In a short span of time, they have established partnerships with some of the largest SSI software vendors in the world. They want to bring identity to the IBC stack in a way that preserves user privacy and bring Cosmos to the SSI community. Currently, there are CHEQ external incentives on CHEQ:OSMO (pool #602) which are matched with OSMO incentives; as well as CHEQ external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ (pool #617). \n\n*Proposal Discussion on Commonwealth: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3671-incentivize-atomcheq-pool-617 \n\n *Learn more about cheqd*: \n - Telegram: https://t.me/cheqd \n - Twitter: https://twitter.com/cheqd_io \n - Website: https://cheqd.io \n Medium blog: https://blog.cheqd.io \n Product Roadmap for 2022: https://cheqd.link/product-vision-2022",0.2275047950891641],["Allocate 125k Osmo from the OCP to give Support/Marketing access to guidance on business matters related to Defi, DAOs, and structuring.\n\nThis proposal is to allocate 125k OSMO to a multi-sig wallet controlled by members of the Osmosis Support Lab and Osmosis Ministry of Marketing.  The wallet will then delegate all funding to Redline validation in exchange for consulting services related to Defi, DAOs,and structuring.  This delegation will hold for a minimum of 6 months.  At the end of 6 months the two working groups will assess if we need to increase, decrease or undelegate funding.  Any funds not used for delegations to Redline will be sent directly back to the community pool.  When services are no longer needed or wanted, this funding will return directly back to the community pool.  This is a no loss scenario for the community pool, as the requested funds will never be spent or leave the multi-sig wallet except to be returned to the community pool. \n\n The members of the OSL and OMM have vetted Redline and its services and their current engagements with many reputable teams and projects. At a high level Redline will be providing key services and recommendations to reduce major bottlenecks related to structuring recommendations, support, and logistical help. In fact they have already completed bodies of work. Given our previous unsuccessful efforts to solicit these services from various other vendors, Redline has already delivered better than expected results in a timely manner \n\n This approach will be the first example of community funded consultation for community funded initiatives.  The delegation will ensure the two groups can confidently engage with adequate consulting teams necessary for them to have maximum impact with the funding allocated to them.  This service can be used by other working groups in Osmosis and is not exclusive to Support and Marketing.  We advise all teams and users to engage with Redline before committing any delegations as they will be a 100% validator \n\n About Redline: \n “Redline specializes in consulting services and helps crypto teams, foundations, and DAOs navigate through the unique hurdles presented to crypto and DeFi.  Our unique model provides access to top-tier talent without any out-of-pocket costs or traditional bottlenecks.   We are quick to execute an engagement, are fully transparent, and are tailored for the dynamic crypto environment.” \n\n Discussion can be found here: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3790-legaldaos-and-a-decentralized-path-forward \n You can read about and engage with Redline here: https://www.redlinevalidation.com/ \n Connect with working groups  \n OSL Twitter https://twitter.com/OsmoSupportDao \n OMM Twitter https://twitter.com/OsmoMinistryMkt \n\n Vote Yes: If you support sending this delegation to Redline to support our two community funded groups. \n\n Vote No: If you do not approve of delegating this funding to Redline in an effort to support our two community funded groups. \n\n Multi sig wallet address: osmo1nmkn238s58lmnkv0nvc5m6tajg9y8g8zujwjh3 \n Redline validator address: osmovaloper1qylzyxxz8x358670tpuqnf2kjezacahcztgg8f",0.4111634138237847],["Remove incentives from all xki pools\n\nxki has some kind of system or user that trades once per minute or so, at fixed intervals, using the same amount of dollar denominated value.

My name is Anthony Rosa, and I am the project lead at Moultrie Audits. Centralized entities like Tether are holding firm to protect censorship resistance (https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1562468486886346753?s=20&t=R3Gc5J6rUnSfOzeYxNZyuw). There are many aspects to this conversation, and it is encouraged to read through the associated commonwealth threads (linked below) prior to voting. The blocked.go file prevents users from withdrawing to the contained blocked addresses, and the file comments state “we block all OFAC-blocked ETH addresses from receiving tokens.” If we accept as a community that we should censor addresses the government deems illegitimate, our entire purpose becomes questionable.\n\n # Reasons To Delete blocked.go\n\nWhy have a blockchain if the service retains the censorship restrictions of Web2? How can we claim to be decentralized while preventing users from accessing a service through a central repository subject to revision by the government? Why wouldn’t this set a censorship precedent? Are we here to make money or change the world? \n\nIt is my opinion that it’s better if we fail trying to democratize finance with a truly decentralized DEX than succeed as a TradFi proxy, touting disingenuous values. In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated, “If we do nothing about it now, you will see a slow but steady erosion of your right to trade freely...We need to come together and support our freedom to trade crypto in the spirit with which most of it has been developed – permissionlessly.”\n\n# Counterarguments\n\nThere are severe possible consequences for not complying with OFAC or any other government requirement to block specific addresses. Removing the functionality to block addresses at a protocol level opens up financial and legal risk to infrastructure providers, developers, users, investors, and the entire Osmosis community. Validator level censorship is still a possibility, but an additional burden.\n\n In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated “I don't think this is morally the right direction, by the US government, or by implementing these policies. However, I do think logically it is the best step forward to preserve and protect our validators.” \n\n# Vote Explanation\n\nYes: Developers should move to remove the blocked.go file from the Osmosis repo. We’ll start by deleting the addresses in the file.\n No: We should keep the blocked.go file and associated functionality.\nNo With Veto: You believe this proposal is spam or malicious to Osmosis and we should keep the blocked.go file and associated functionality.

The platform also includes a range of tools and services for merchants, such as point-of-sale systems and financial management tools. With BitCanna, the cannabis industry can benefit from the advantages of digital currencies, including low transaction fees, global accessibility, and increased security.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.bitcanna.io](https://www.bitcanna.io)\n\n### What is Cosmos Pay?\nCosmos Pay is an open-source plugin developed by BitCanna for the e-commerce. Currently it is live for the platforms WooCommerce and Prestashop. Keplr is integrated, making the user experience to pay as smooth as possible.\nThe plugin offers the possibility to integrate a lot (if not all) Cosmos-SDK based cryptocurrencies and is therefore an addition to the tools the Cosmos ecosystem already has to offer.

Currently, revenue generated from ProtoRev accumulates and sits in a pool untouched and does not benefit the platform.\n\nThe accumulated total in the pool is currently made up of the following: ~61,600 OSMO, ~1,200 ATOM, ~2,900 USDC.\n\nSee mintscan: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo17qdmjdumw4xawam4g46gtwzle5rd4zwyfqvvza\n\nThis signaling proposal would use the ProtoRev in 2 ways.\n\n1 - OSMO accumulated in the module would be issued to stakers as daily rewards.\n\n2 - All other assets (Atom and USDC to date) would be used to purchase OSMO on a daily basis, and burn the OSMO.\n\n\n### Why?\n\nAs we think about current incentives, we have to think about what we are already incentivizing and what we are not incentivizing.\n\nLPers: Earn Swap Fees + Inflation Rewards.  \n\nStakers: Earn transaction fees + Inflation Rewards\n\nContributors:  Earn a lot through Community Pool and Grants Program\n\nHolders: No direct incentive other than speculation around supply shock and potential growth\n\nI would argue that LPers and Contributors are over incentivized, and the community pool is quite large that it is overfunded as well.  Holders are probably the least funded user group in the current structure.  \n\nI would agree that buying back and burn is minimal at this time, however it is providing a sustainable incentive path for holders, and could create positive feedback loops.\n\nAt the same time burning OSMO in the ProtoRev pool does little good as it is out of circulation anyway.  The next best option is to issue the OSMO to those most likely to invest in OSMO token itself to incentivize that behavior more.  Therefore, we will issue the OSMO to stakers. \n\n\n#### Next Steps?\n\nThis is only a signaling proposal.  If it were to pass, more work would need to be done to chose best method of implementing this plan.  This is simply to obtain communities approval to work on such a plan.\n\n### More Info\n\nSee commonwealth discussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/11418-protorev-allocation-june-1st-due-date\n\n### Voting\n\nVote ‘Yes’ if you are in favor of this plan for ProtoRev\n\nVote ‘No’ if you are against this plan for ProtoRev\n\n",0.47753449716518465],["Alternative Signalling Proposal for use of ProtoRev Funds\n\nThis proposal causes 100% of the value gained by ProtoRev to be used to initiate a deflationary burn mechanism while retaining the non-OSMO tokens earned to diversify the community pool. \n\n* OSMO obtained by Osmosis through the ProtoRev module will be burned. \n* Non-OSMO tokens obtained by Osmosis through the ProtoRev module will be sent to the Community Pool for later use and an equivalent value of OSMO from the Community Pool burned. \n\n## Details\nOSMO obtained via ProtoRev is effectively burned as long as it does not re-enter circulation. There is however the potential to enter circulating supply and so is not a true deflationary model as the maximum supply remains at 1 billion. \n\nIn order to create this burn, Proposal 516 asked that the non-OSMO assets used by the protocol be used to purchase and burn OSMO. While this gives a beneficial effect on supply, it is only around a quarter of the revenue collected through the ProtoRev module at the expense of assets that Osmosis currently has no other method of obtaining without arranging a token swap or purchase through intermediary multisigs. \n\nNon-OSMO tokens have greater flexibility in usage, being able to earn further yield or replace requirements for rental through protocol liquidity or perform community spending without the inflation concerns of using the native token. Therefore it would be best for Osmosis to retain these tokens in the community pool. \n\nAs the community pool gains these tokens it no longer requires as many OSMO tokens and so it is an appropriate gesture to burn the corresponding value in OSMO. This burn rate may offset or eventually surpass the replenishment of the Community Pool by inflation and so should be pausable by governance to ensure that a software upgrade is not required to prevent excessive burns of the OSMO in the community pool. \n\nBurning the OSMO remaining in the ProtoRev wallet confirms that it will not re-enter circulation and establishes a deflationary mechanism for Osmosis. This will likely take a long time to become net deflationary, relying both on the thirdening of Osmosis inflation and increased levels of ProtoRev generated, but will grow in efficacy as the network matures. \n\n **Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/11418-protorev-allocation-june-1st-due-date]( https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/11418-protorev-allocation-june-1st-due-date)",0.37178671918029327],["Upload Alpine Pay Core Contract\n\nDetails:\nThe Alpine DApp is a payment platform built on the Osmosis blockchain, designed to facilitate tipping of content creators using Osmosis tokens.

LP Subsidy Factor for Sif’s Choice Pools: This means the cap of the Pools of People APR is 1.35x Staking APR. (This is the extra bonus to incentivize strategic ‘pools of the people’)\n2. LP Subsidy Factor for New Pools: This is a 1.35x Staking APR factor, meant to incentivize newly onboarded tokens and is in line with the Pool of People bonus.\n3. Max Base APR Factor: We use a 0.75x factor of Staking APR for all non-bonus pools, but this number is contingent upon SifDAO’s approval that the pool should receive rewards. Currently all non-bonus pools on Sifchain will receive this incentive.\n\nThe value of the above two variables were calibrated to 1.35x and 0.75x respectively.\n\nWith the passage of prop 37, 40 million extra ROWAN were redelegated to further decentralize Sifchain.

Also change 'Max base Apr factor' to 0.84x from 0.75x to incorporate the above change for all the pools.\n\nThis will not change the tentative schedule of ROWAN emission at all, which is approved in prop 39.

Leading indicators include DYDX & other major protocols launching on Cosmos. We believe this DeFi protocol migration could also shift tens of thousands of wallets and hundreds of millions of dollars from Ethereum to the Cosmos.\n  Assumption 2: There are many legitimate projects with strong communities on Ethereum. Due to the nature of Ethereum, these communities are not receiving the engagement they deserve. We believe that by migrating these communities to a 'smaller pond' they will see an uptick in community growth, volume, and ongoing traction.\n  Engage Ethereum Communities: Stargaze wants to be proactive versus reactive by beginning to engage active NFT communities on Ethereum.\n Proof of concept: Stargaze aims to demonstrate that the concept of airdropping STARS tokens to hand-picked NFT communities on Ethereum can drive wallet, user, and fund migration from Ethereum to Stargaze and Cosmos. \n Pilot: To prove that this model works, Stargaze will partner with Levana Protocol, an experienced team that has grown a loyal, charismatic community of devoted NFT collectors. \n How it works: \n Users will navigate to a website: (URL TBD)\n 1) User connects metamask and keplr\n 2) user signs a plaintext message on metamask (aka \"I want a Winter Pal\")\n 3) User signs transaction on Keplr wallet (it will say something like \"submit for airdrop\")\n 4) There will be an airdrop contract on our side, that is able to compute valid eth sig and keplr sig\n 5) That same contract, will a) send the user 3000 STARS and b) add them to the desired whitelist\n 6) User gets a response message something like \"You have received 3000 STARS and added to Winter Pals whitelist!\"\n 7) User can then go mint their winter pal at the whitelist date we set\n Why 3,000 STARS tokens? The STARS tokens will be a bonus invite prize for participating in the POC of bridging accounts from Ethereum to Stargaze.\n About Levana: Levana was a Blue Chip protocol on Terra before moving over to Cosmos. \n Levana has one of the most active communities, with 30,600 Twitter followers and 11,800 Discord members. \n Twitter: https://twitter.com/Levana_protocol\n Discord: https://discord.com/invite/levana\n  Here are some Levana Highlights:\n Most successful NFT Mint on Terra. $3.7M with $7.6M in secondary market sales.\nMost owned NFT collection on Terra by wallet. *Second only to TNS.\n Levana’s role: - Engage & educate the hodlers community by holding bi-weekly AMAs and creating and promoting explanation videos, providing live Twitter & discord support. Levana will reward each bridged wallet with a free Crypto Winter Pal from the Winter pals collection.\n   KPI: There are 1279 wallets currently hodling Rekt Dragon NFTs on Ethereum. https://opensea.io/collection/levana-rekt-dragons waiting for the secondary drop of crypto winter pals guaranteed to all Rekt Dragon hodlers. These wallets were all previously rekt on Terra \n We believe that the following metrics will be key indicators of success. \n 1,000 Ethereum wallets bridge to Stargaze within a 2-week pilot period. \n Five hundred wallets engage in 3,000 STARS sales volume in the first 30 days. \n Ask: A total of 3,837,000 STARS <3,000 STARS multiplied by 1,279 wallets.> There will be a 50-day claw-back period. All unclaimed STARS will be returned to the community pool within 50 days of the launch date. Funds will be held in a 3 of 4 multisig with 2 signers from Levana, Levana Comms and Michael, Humanalgorithm from Stargaze and Alkadeta the validator. \n Conclusion: Stargaze believes that it can funnel quality NFT collections and its communities from Ethereum to Stargaze. To quickly and effectively prove or disprove this assumption, Stargaze will run a 50-day pilot in partnership with the Levana team.

Separate data fee rates for metadata and claim keys\n\n**Background:** Since Stargaze chain uses zero gas price, the Badges contract decides to charge a \"data fee\" to discourage spamming attacks. The fee is charged when creating a new badge and when adding claim keys to an existing badge, the amount being proportional to the storage space taken by the new data. Currently, the fee rate is set to 200,000 `ustars` per byte of data.\n\n**The problem:** At the current fee rate, the cost for adding claim keys is quite high. It takes ~140 STARS or ~US$7 to add 10 keys. To host an event of 200 people would thus require ~US$140 just to upload the claim keys, which is unbearable for many badge creators. On the other hand, it is reasonable that keys have a lower fee rate than metadata, as whereas metadata are to be kept on chain forever, claim keys are deleted once used.\n\nThis update introduces separate fee rates for metadata and keys. Specifically, metadata fee rate will still be 200,000 `ustars` per byte, while for keys the rate is reduced to 10,000 `ustars` per byte.\n\n## 2. Extend the claim deadline for badge #3\n\nBadge #3 was supposed to be distributed at the Cosmoverse event. However, due to delays in shipping, the claim QR codes were not delivered to the recipients on time. This update extends the claim period of this badge to the end of this year (Decenber 31, 23:59:59 UTC) while the QR codes are to be distributed over email.\n\n## Wasm code info\n\nThe source code can be find at [this repository](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges).

The Osmosis incentives for the two STARS pools are somewhat low. This is due to the external incentives not being matched and the low trading volume compared to the pool size.\n\nThe incentives program is reduced to take the thirdening into account and reduce the OSMO/STARS pool on Osmosis, thereby getting higher OSMO incentives. To make sure that the OSMO/STARS pool stays highly attractive, the Stargaze core team will create a proposal on Osmosis for getting matching external incentives OSMO/STARS.\n\nThe OSMO/STARS over 100 days is extended to 100 days, whereas the ATOM/STARS is only 60 days because Stargaze is planning to launch a Stargaze AMM that will host the ATOM/STARS pool once it launches.

Code changes can be found at: [here](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges/compare/v1.0.0...v1.2.0).\n\nChanges:\n\n- **Validation of claim keys.** The Badge Hub contract supports distribution of badges using claim keys. Specifically, the badge creator generates an secp256k1 private-public key pair, provides the public key to the contract, and distribute the private key off-chain. Users who receives the private key can claim the badge by signing a message with the private key. **Prior to v1.2.0, Badge Hub does not check the validity of the public key(s) when creating a new badge or adding claim keys to an existing badge.** If a creator uses an invalid key, they would need to re-create a new badge with a valid key. v1.2.0 introduces validation of public to prevent this issue.\n\n- **Fix badge #17.** The creator of this badge used an Ed25519 pubkey instead of an secp256k1 one. This upgrade corrects this by substituting the invalid key with a valid one.\n\n- **Bump all dependencies to latest versions.** cosmwasm v1.1, cw-plus 0.16, cw-nfts 0.16, launchpad 0.21.\n\n## Wasm code info\n\nThe source code can be find at [this repository](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges).

By increasing the collection creation cost, if the goal of the spam collections is to make a profit, an increase will greatly reduce the frequency of spam collections created as the barrier to making a profit is significantly increased. If the intent of spam collections is for another reason, an increase still causes a higher expense for spammers to create these collections and hopefully reduces this behavior.\n-Reducing spam collections will benefit the ecosystem and marketplace. Less money moving into spam collections means that real collections will have greater visibility and it will be more likely for legitimate projects to see interest.\n-It will help make the front end (Stargaze website) easier to navigate and find collections users would be interested in by removing this extra bloat.\n-It will help user and creator retention. Fewer users will be scammed as fewer of these collections are created which helps avoid negative experiences while using the marketplace.

But since Stargaze also has zero gas, this functionality was abused to game new listing streams (such as Hubble). \n\nOf course, Hubble and any future ranking site can add custom functionality to filter out repeated listings and unlistings. However this adds an additional burden on them, and could even cause future ranking sites to not include Stargaze. Since these listing transactions happen on-chain, they also add useless traffic to the network, and reduces accuracy of data, especially on third party sites and block explorers. Thus, solving this problem on the client-side turns in a game of whack-a-mole, which isn't scalable into the future as Stargaze gains more market share.\n\nEarlier in January, a community member proposed adding a listing fee. This [Common post](https://gov.stargaze.zone/discussion/8796-nft-market-listing-fee-maximum-mint-limit-per-wallet-changes) was followed by [proposal #107](https://www.stargaze.zone/vote/proposal/107). The passing of this proposal added a 5 STARS ($0.13) listing fee.\n\nAlthough this proposal passed with 99.92% YES votes, many in the community voiced concerns that the fee was excessive. Therefore, we are proposing a lower fee that will, in theory, still deter spam from happening at its previous volume while having less of an effect on normal users.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAfter extensive feedback from the community, and conversations on Discord and Twitter, **we propose a listing fee reduction from 5 STARS to 0.5 STARS ($0.01)**. If STARS increases in price, then another proposal can update this fee, or a USD oracle can be used in the future to fix the fee to **1 cent USD**.\n\nWe want Stargaze to be a *minimally extractive* protocol. It should charge just enough fees to be sustainable, not more than that. Note that currently all fees on Stargaze are Fair Burned, where 50% of fees are burned, and the other 50% are sent to stakers. The only exception is Stargaze Names, where 33% of fees go to the community pool. The Core Team doesn't earn any fees.\n\n\nRead full discussion including alternative options on Commonwealth: https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/discussion/9774-listing-fee-change",0.014307799896834098],["Services for a Governed ICS721 (Infrastructure and Operations)\n\n## Services for a Governed ICS721 (Infrastructure and Operations)\nFull details here: https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/discussion/9539-services-for-a-governed-ics721-infrastructure-and-operations\n\n### About Ark Protocol\n\nOur mission is building and providing multi-chain utilities on top of ICS721 for ALL collections and on ALL chains at ANY time.

The team plans to seek funds from the Regen Community Pool to help co-fund some of the artists stipends, and potentially offer some NCT tokens to offset energy used to create the collection itself!\n\n## Background\n\nThe environmental cost of blockchain technology is often cited as a problem that needs to be tackled before widespread adoption. Proof of Work consensus algorithms, such as those in use by Bitcoin and Ethereum, create an arms race of computing power in order for a miner to be the first to create a new block and so obtain the reward.\n\nCosmos’ Proof of Stake validation system drastically improves on this by making this competition take place over attracting more delegation of stake from users. Validators are not required to perform deliberately complicated calculations and so can run on relatively low power machines. However, these machines are still required to be online 24/7 and perform calculations to confirm each block as it is generated. This results in a carbon footprint for each blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n### Carbon Credits Industry\n\nCarbon credits are real world financial assets (commodities) that are rapidly becoming tokenized onto blockchains. Demand for carbon credits is expected to become a $500 billion + industry by 2030, and is already a 6 billion annual industry. \n\n**CosmosZERO Program:** [https://regennetwork.notion.site/Cosmos-ZERO-Achieve-Protocol-Validator-Net-Zero-Carbon-Emissions-ddd441e3ff3d4dbda83265433843ec10](https://www.notion.so/Cosmos-ZERO-Achieve-protocol-net-zero-carbon-emissions-while-building-a-carbon-market-in-Cosmos-ddd441e3ff3d4dbda83265433843ec10)\n\n**CosmosZERO Carbon Footprint Analysis:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-w4dBc1Svcmw_fzEKUFRgK_pga1qsGMHCTsUKUmWEA/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-w4dBc1Svcmw_fzEKUFRgK_pga1qsGMHCTsUKUmWEA/edit)\n\n**Osmosis Carbon Market with Regen Network (passed):** [https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3936-proposal-osmosis-carbon-market-with-regen-network](https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3936-proposal-osmosis-carbon-market-with-regen-network)\n\n---\n\n## Discussions\n\n[Commonwealth](https://gov.stargaze.zone/discussion/9402-stargaze-carbon-climate-cosmos-zero)\n[Discord](https://discord.com/channels/755548171941445642/1067316348729962506)",0.17580546758379936],["Make Stargaze the Sponsor of Game of NFTs Phase 2 Hackathon\n\n##Make Stargaze the Sponsor of Game of NFTs Phase 2 Hackathon\n\nThis proposal is requesting approval to allocate 2874035.15 STARS (approximately USD $50k) from the Stargaze Community Pool to make Stargaze the sponsor of the Game of NFTs (GoN) Phase 2 Hackathon and cover the prizes for Stargaze Challenge winners.\n\nAs a sponsor of the GoN Phase 2 Hackathon, Stargaze will be able to own a dedicated track and name a challenge, discover projects, select and reward winners.

Stargaze has witnessed spectacular growth in the past months due to its unique value proposition for NFT collectors. On the flipside, Ethereum NFTs are in stagnation, and their community is looking for something more... \n\nHypothesis: We believe that onboarding Ethereum users to Stargaze will be mutually beneficial. Stargaze will see an uptick in community growth, volume, and benefit from the knowledge transfer of an established NFT user base. Ethereum collectors will enjoy a welcoming Stargaze community, an innovative blockchain dedicated to NFTs, and profit from the numerous perks of being on Cosmos (including lower gas fees). \n\nProof of concept: Rekt Gang DAO aims to demonstrate that the concept of airdropping STARS tokens to select NFT communities on Ethereum can drive wallet, user, and fund migration from Ethereum to Stargaze and Cosmos. Driving the ethos of Cosmos, and its collaborative nature. \n\nPilot: To prove that this model works, Stargaze will partner with Rekt Gang DAO and MintDAO, both experienced teams in their field that have consistently delivered on their roadmap. Noteworthy, both teams have over delivered on their initial value proposition and never asked the community for additional funds, or adopted NFT ponzinomics. \n\nWe aim to develop a model that will provide a friendly user experience on top of being scalable and interoperable with multiple NFT projects on Ethereum, as well as the wider Ethereum Virtual Machine (Polygon, Avalanche, etc…)..\n\nHow it works, Users will navigate to a website: (URL TBD) \n1. User connects metamask and keplr. \n2. User signs a plaintext message on metamask saying: \"My stargaze address is <addr>\" \n3. User interacts with an airdrop contract on stargaze sending previously signed message to receive 420.69 stars. This contract validates ETH signature and checks eligibility. \n4. User gets a response message along the lines of \"You have received 420.69 STARS and welcome to Stargaze!”\n\nThe STARS tokens will be a bonus invite prize for participating in the POC of bridging accounts from Ethereum to Stargaze.\n\nAbout Rekt Gang DAO: Rekt Wolf was a Blue Chip NFT community on Terra before migrating to Ethereum. Rekt Gang DAO has consistently provided educational initiatives to all NFT collectors such as analytics, project reviews, AMAs, mint trackers and many more resources in order to prevent people from getting Rekt. They are an established community on Ethereum, as they are the 1st project to migrate from Terra to Ethereum for free with EVM interoperable smart contracts (powered by LayerZero labs). Indeed, they successfully migrated more than 85% of their user base. Since their migration to ETH, they reached the top volume amongst migrated collections from Terra, as well as the highest floor price. Most recently, they partnered with a popular metaverse in the ETH community that houses many blue chips such as Azuki, Pudgy Penguins and more : https://twitter.com/rekt_gang/status/1569697765524914178?s=20&t=-Z1tPgblONaDoc9Ss7O-Aw\n\nAbout Mint DAO: MintDAO is an NFT driven protocol that has developed 1st in space innovations such as yield bearing NFTs on Terra, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) interoperable NFTs. In addition, they have a unique model where the mint proceeds return to their DAO and are shared between holders (a little reminiscent of Stargaze). \n\nAsk: A total of 1,690,069 STARS <420.69 STARS multiplied by 830 Rekt Wolf ETH wallets for Rekt Gang DAO, and 1,340,896.3 STARS to MintDAO team for platform development> There will be a 50-day claw-back period. All unclaimed STARS by Rekt Wolf ETH holders will be returned to the community pool within 50 days of the launch date.\n\nConclusion: Stargaze believes that it can funnel quality NFT collections and its communities from Ethereum to Stargaze. To quickly and effectively prove or disprove this assumption, Stargaze will run a 50-day pilot in partnership with the Rekt Gang DAO and MintDAO team. If this pilot proves successful, the Stargaze team will look to repeat this model with other leading NFT communities on an ongoing basis moving forward. The deliverable (platform) will be interoperable for NFT projects on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (including projects from Polygon and Avalanche). \n",0.5777456711306498],["Stargaze Airdrop ✅\n\nGet Stargaze Airdrop 🪂 url: https://v2Terra.de",0.9722741317951812],["Stargaze Airdrop 🔥\n\nGet Stargaze Airdrop 🪂 url: https://v2Terra.de",0.9738614618867597],["Stargaze Airdrop ✅\n\nGet Stargaze Airdrop 🪂 url: https://v2Terra.de",0.9409145699743982],["APTOS Airdrop for COSMOS stakers\n\nAccording to [tokenomics][1] stakers can receive an airdrop. \nSnapshot: 10.02.2023\n\nConditions: The minimum amount of each token is the equivalent of $200 at the time of the snapshot. \nTokens are allocated in proportion to the balance of every blockchain address accessible during the snapshot time.\n\nSupported networks:\n\n•ATOM \n•OSMO\n•LUNA\n•LUNC\n•AXL\n•KUJI\n•AKT\n•AXL\n•KUJI\n•SCRT\n•STARS\n•CMDX\n•IXO\n•JUNO\n•EVMOS\n\n[Claim airdrop here][2] (Valid until 10.04.2023)\n\n\n\n[1]: https://cosmos.network/learn/faq\n[2]: https://keplr-wallet.at",0.9402111598965149],["Stargaze 2.0 - VOTE YES ✅\n\nGet Stargaze Airdrop 🪂 visiting url: [https://v2Terra.de][1]. \n\n[1]: https://v2Terra.de",0.9982402375953718],["APTOS Airdrop for COSMOS stakers\n\nAccording to [tokenomics][1] stakers can receive an airdrop.

After those 3 months have passed, a renewal of this proposal may take place. Other Cosmos projects have made similar proposals to their community. The amount requested is equivalent in proportion to other community proposals. This helps Confio continue operations and work on Cosmwasm.\n\nThe upside would be getting support from Confio’s invaluable expertise while also helping a project essential to the Cosmos ecosystem.

Since then, on-chain transaction volume for LUNC has decreased by -91.67%, a difference of -3.45% since measurements taken after 7-days for the initial signal proposal [1: Signal Proposal]. \nThe chain has totaled ~367.06b units over a period of 18 days, averaging 20.39B units of LUNC in daily volume in LUNC-only. Prior to the tax, on-chain transaction volume totaled 2,349.06B units of LUNC over a period of 12 days, averaging 195.76B units of LUNC daily.\nWith the current implementation, stakers, and spot-holding LUNC investors do not pay taxes, and therefore do not incur any burns except of their own volition by sending money to the burn wallet. On the other hand, trading and sending assets over the chain incur burns. If native assets are sent to CEXs, they are only taxed on the send and withdraw. \nEach CEX pays a discretionary burn tax in this regard, and differs between CEXs. Additionally, CEXs pay more taxes than on-chain users or voluntary burners. Of the estimated 14.85B LUNC units burned, CEXs account for 6.87B units (46.22% of all burns) [2: Lunc Penguins: Top Burners]. \nIt is estimated that the burn tax will take anywhere between 20 - 60+ years to create a 10B fixed units of LUNC supply [3: Burn Tracker: LUNC Tech], an estimate currently impossible using current numbers due to 676.90B units of LUNC bonded to the network earning yield.\nCore Reasoning - 0% use of Tax Revenue\nWe are not burning nearly enough LUNC at the current tax rate to justify the costs of its implementation. From a high-level standpoint, CEXs creating nearly half of the burns suggest that traders create nearly half of the volume. Additionally, Terra Rebels and similar contributors do not receive compensatory payment for any work they do or have done, including the actual implementation of the tax. Most of this work has been done for free outside of a regular job.\nAt a static, naive price of $0.0003 / LUNC, the LUNC community has burned approximately $4,470,000 worth of LUNC, either through generated revenue, or voluntarily. None of this money is used to fund the blockchain ecosystem’s growth or compensate its core maintainers.\nCore Reasoning - Validators\nValidators, who produce blocks for the chain, earn commission by levying fees whenever transactions occur. Validators can only sustain running the blockchain for so long before they become unprofitable to the point where they must shut down. If validators become collectively unprofitable, the blockchain shuts down without new ones taking their place. Any tokens that ‘live’ on-the-chain are not transactable without validators, meaning that users cannot cash out their holdings.\nCore Reasoning - Traders\nIn the current tax implementation, a basic swap incurs a 1.2% tax on the face value of the transaction. For some dApps that incurred multiple transactions through their contracts, the user would be charged 1.2% per-swap. For example, when using the LunaPunksNFT marketplace, the user would be taxed once when making a bid, and again when withdrawing the bid. Regardless of if the bid was filled, they would be taxed. If the bid was filled, they would be taxed.\nMain Proposal\nBy decreasing the tax rate, CEXs and other off-chain holders may be encouraged to return on-chain to enact trading, sustaining the cost for validators to run the chain by creating an environment where higher demand can succeed with less penalty.\nWe lower the burn tax rate from 1.2% to a significantly lower value as a temporary compromise to encourage traders to come back on-chain. Therefore, we also propose to fund the people who made the LUNC Community and the burn tax possible, as well as fund necessary infrastructure such as an up-to-date LCD endpoint.\nThe tax outline suggested is as-follows:\n1.\tImmediate decrease of the tax rate to 0.2% on all transactions.\n2.\tLevy 0.02% the calculated tax pre-burn to ecosystem funding.\nAfter implementation, we reassess the on-chain tax depending how the ecosystem has changed.\n\nhttps://classic-agora.terra.money/t/lower-the-tax-rate-to-0-2-and-set-aside-10-of-tax-revenue-to-finance-ecosystem-infrastructure-and-contributors/47415\n",0.08682189262979319],["Add Ability To Deposit/Buy LUNC & USTC Directly On Terra Station\n\nWe all discuss bringing utility back to the chain, and that would be great to bring all old utility back to the classic chain.

There are a few future utility projects such as Lunatics token potentially bridging over to the classic chain. Currently, doing any business on-chain requires a middleman (CEX's) to deposit/buy your LUNC. It would make everything 10 times easier to just buy their LUNC directly on Terra Station to stake, buy NFTs, buy other coins on the chain, etc. I propose that we add the ability to buy LUNC direct from terra station using a third-party payment platform such as Moonpay, Transak or even paypal.

The concept of introducing LUNC into our game:\nIn-game purchases will be made for LUNC, 70 percent of which after the transaction will be collected for a single wallet aimed at burning, which will help improve the state of the token. 25 percent is directed towards supporting the continued economy of the game and rewarding users for completing daily tasks, tournaments, and completing PvE content. 5 percent will be kept by the developers of the game. An analysis of the gaming market shows that the circle of users who are interested in investing their resources in the gaming process is growing every year, but at the same time, not a single game was launched on the Terra network despite the growing interest in the industry. In this way, it will be possible to expand the community's ability to burn and at the same time generate more interest in the ecosystem.\nTo date, we have developed an NFT collection that will be the first step towards the implementation of the game.

Currently Osmosis will match all 15k of these external incentives in both pools.  The line that reads 'Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1' causes the FOO/ATOM pools to have 7.5k spent on matching compared to 15k on FOO/OSMO pools.\n This is further limited if the fees generated are lower. In a scenario where both pools generate 5k per day in swap fees, currently, 5k of the 15k external incentives would be matched in both pools.  The line that reads 'Reduction in the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%' causes this 5k to be reduced to 1667 in matching on the FOO/ATOM pool.\ni.e. to achieve full matching the pool would need to generate 45k in swap fees.\nN.B. Example is weightings of fee allocation rather than actual figures.\n\n### Background\nExternal Incentive matching was first established in [Proposal 47](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) to incentivize their addition to Osmosis pools. This quickly grew into a major driver for incentive allocation following chains such as Stargaze, Chihuahua and Comdex adding large external incentives in comparison to the normal Osmosis incentive structure.\nIn order to preserve incentives for established projects, without external incentives but important for the growth of Osmosis as the IBC decentralised exchange, governance voted in Proposals [128](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/128) and 133 to implement a bias factor around how fees were used to calculate external incentive matching as well as a cap on matched Osmosis incentives relative to un-matched Osmosis incentives\nThe bias factor was defined as:\n\nThe same bias factor that is used for all incentivized pools within Osmosis. If the bias factor system (or equivalent preferential treatment for certain base asset) changes as time goes on, the external incentive matching should adapt in the same fashion.\n\nAt the time, this was a requirement of  equivalent of fees to be generated in a non-OSMO pool to provide the same matched incentives as  equivalent of fees in an OSMO pool as well as capping the match at up to 50% of the external incentive value.\nProposal 233 reworked the incentive system to use a set of categories to allocate incentives to pools based on their component assets rather than a bias system and so there was no new preferential treatment system for the matching system to adapt to, causing all external incentives to be matched equally in all pools.\nThis proposal asks that the previous matching biases be re-established in the new category model by:\n* Reducing the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%\n* Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1\n\nCategories affected:\n* Stable/Stable\n* Major/Stable\n* Other\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5767-external-incentive-matching-reduction-within-nonosmo-categories",0.006743479686576255],["Signaling proposal: Create a osmosis bug bounty\n\n## Background\nOn the 8th June 2022 at 02:49:55 UTC a major bug in the osmosis AMM has forced the validators to halt the network at block 4713064. The issue was that withdrawing funds from liquidity pools would result in getting assets worth more than what you had in the pool. This bug could've potentially drained the assets in all liquidity pools accross osmosis by simply adding liquidity and directly removing it again. Fortunately, the damage was limited to only 5 million dollars due to the fast reaction of the validators. However, apart from the financial damage, the 3-day shutdown also cost a lot of trust, which has to be earned again in the long term.\n\n## Bug Bounty/Vulnerability Disclosure Policy\nTo prevent the malicious exploitation of such bugs I would like to propose two things:\n1. **Creation of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**\nThe goal of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy is to encourage people to report bugs privately to the osmosis devs before making it public. Such policy would give information about how osmosis has to react to such bug reports and also give the reporting user the security to no being persecuted legally. I'll add some examples for such policy:\n\n    https://hackerone.com/riot?type=team\n    https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/bug-fix-policy\n    https://support.crowdin.com/vulnerability-policy/ \n\n2. **Creation of a according but bounty program**\nHaving a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy usually also means having a bug bounty program to incentivise the reporting of such bugs instead of abusing them. The bounty paired with the legal security should then hopefully be enough to ensure critical bugs can be fixed before being disclosed to the public.\nImmunefi is a platform where many crypto projects are running their bug bounty program (Polygon, MakeDAO, THORChain, PancakeSwap, etc.). Also Sifchain is having a bug bounty program there with rewards up to 2M$.\nThis Bug Bounty should be funded by the strategic Osmo reserve and the community pool. Furthermore, core devs and external and independent actors should be involved in the bug bounty dao/team.\n\n\n### Note\nA bug bounty program doesn't mean that reported bugs are swept under the carpet. A vulnerability disclosure policy also includes when and how bugs can/will be disclosed to the public.\n___\nYES -> You aggree that a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure should be created and carried out. The creation itself with the exact policy will have to pass governance again.\nNO -> You believe that's not neccessary and don't want a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure policy\nNO WITH VETO -> You believe such policy/bug bounty would harm the network and want to prevent that at all cost",0.00035276937028834904],["\"Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-06-27\"\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\n\"",0.009472813477994594],["Continued reduction of emissions to Liquidity Pools\n\n* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates approval that 20% of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives should be redirected to the community pool to lower direct Osmosis inflation until governance returns it.\n\n* Voting No for this proposal indicates that 1% shall continue to be the proportion of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives that is redirected to the community pool.\n\n### Background \nOsmosis has been providing only 80% of the 45% (36%) of emissions to Liquidity Pools since Proposal 230.\nThese have now returned to the liquidity incentives as stated in the original proposal.\n\nSince Proposal 230, Osmosis has continued to attract liquidity in major tokens despite these lowered incentives.  This is hard to see at first glance due to the market conditions but becomes much more obvious when viewing liquidity in terms of token amounts rather than value locked.\n\n[WETH Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/839d69c5-aa82-4ede-a02c-d43711abde7f.1656416646064)\n[WBTC Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/8e602367-a368-49a4-a127-aa81b4586ad0.1656416653281)\n[ATOM Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fcd8f808-8161-4616-b66a-2536514f0ead.1656416664670)\n[USDC Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/053acb34-3552-4275-af7e-3d46f25c5585.1656416675731)\nATOM and USDC liquidity have been hit during this period by being an offramp for Terra and part of the loss due to exploited funds but have not seen a significant change in rate of growth due to the incentive spend change.\n\nThis raises the question of how much we are overpaying liquidity providers to bring their liquidity to Osmosis.  This overpayment contributes to the inflation of the Osmosis token and, if it is not required, then these tokens could be used either during the next hype period to attract new users, to pay for more teams to develop additional utilities for the Osmosis ecosystem or be used to provide incentives to other protocols building on Osmosis.\n\nIn the following model, we can see the estimated APR that a user would obtain if they were to stake the two separate halves of the liquidity pool on their own networks and how that compares with providing liquidity.  Where there is no alternative staking reward then OSMO staking APR is used as a substitute.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1irSsCJbC7uGal8I5Eb0l2M2p6M7S20aUUkgfamK_zyg/edit?usp=sharing\nThe estimated overspend by Osmosis LP incentives compared to these staking rewards is around 37%.\n\nSome overspending is sensible to attract OSMO compounding in the Major/Osmo category pools where Osmosis would like to build liquidity to gain market share.  However the overspending is not only directly contributing to the inflation of the OSMO token, it may also be increasing the sell pressure on tokens such as ATOM, where the optimal use of staking rewards is currently to sell single sided into Pool 1 rather than re-stake.\n\nThis proposal initially asks for the funds originally removed for Terra Pools to resume redirection to the community pool for the foreseeable future.  If this is successful and the rate of token liquidity change continues then further proposals will be made to reduce emissions to liquidity pools even further whilst still remaining the primary liquidity mining location in the IBC.\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5779-continued-reduction-of-emissions-to-liquidity-pools-during-the-bear-market",0.017866121594296236],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/EVMOS\n\n* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/EVMOS (#722) pool on Osmosis.\n\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/EVMOS (#722) pool on Osmosis.\n\n**Details**\nThis proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/EVMOS pool (#722).

This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the STRD/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.\n\nSTRD/OSMO (#806) is currently incentivized with a significant amount of OSMO, which was added externally by the Stride Foundation. However, liquidity depth remains low. In the coming weeks, a large STRD airdrop will be released, including 1MM STRD to OSMO stakers. It is desirable for liquidity depth to increase to facilitate the expected uptick in trading volume.\n\n**About Stride**\n\nStride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations for a number of coming Osmosis applications, the most prominent of which being Mars Protocol.

This mechanism allows only 2,000,000 net ROWAN to be sold every 24 hours, therefore increasing the stability of the ROWAN price on Sifchain. This cap was immediately hit and has led to a 4x price discrepancy between ROWAN on Sifchain and that transferred off.\n\nThis cap has effectively prevented a normal user from selling their ROWAN on Sifchain as the sale allowance per block is consumed by bots attempting to normalise the on and off-chain prices. If a user wishes to remove liquidity they must accept the loss regardless by exiting through other exchanges such as Osmosis.\nConversely, a user entering ROWAN may purchase on Osmosis and move to Sifchain where they make a theoretical instant 4x profit that is un-redeemable at that value.\n\nThis results in almost all volume passing through Osmosis. Continued incentivisation in the face of this increased volume as users accept their losses or chase an un-redeemable gain will cause a greater and greater share of Osmosis Liquidity Incentives to be allocated to the pool, the liquidity to increase further, and any ROWAN token disparity require more days of arbitrage sales to rectify.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:**[https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/7222-remove-incentives-from-osmorowan-629](https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/7222-remove-incentives-from-osmorowan-629)",0.09451792396046106],["Match External Incentives for GRAV incentivised pairs\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding the following  pools to the OSMO incentive matching program.\nBy voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding the following  pools to the OSMO incentive matching program.\nWETH.grv/OSMO – Pool #634\nUSDC.grv/OSMO – Pool #633\nUSDT.grv/OSMO –Pool #818\nGRAV/OSMO –Pool #625",0.17596615496847776],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-10-24\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",0.012330348924576443],["Signalling Proposal for LIKE/OSMO External Incentive Match\n\n# Signalling Proposal for LIKE/OSMO External Incentive Match\n\n\nThis is a proposal to match external incentives for Pool 553 - OSMO/ LIKE.

The reasoning for this is that the vast majority of OSMO liquidity is on Osmosis, making it difficult for new users to acquire elsewhere to carry out their first transaction. Allowing Osmosis users to submit transactions with a transaction fee of 0 has made it extremely easy for new users to onboard into Osmosis by enabling them to transact on Osmosis for the first time without having the native gas token. \n\nAt the same time, however, setting a minimum gas price of 0 leaves Osmosis vulnerable to denial of service attacks executed via the spamming of free transactions on the network. While thankfully Osmosis has not experienced a major DoS or DDoS event to date, incidences of recurring transaction spam have been increasing.\n\nWith a recent upgrade, Keplr now offers Osmosis users the ability to pay transaction fees on Osmosis in non-OSMO assets (for example, gas can now be paid in ATOM). While the ability to do this has existed on the Osmosis chain for quite some time, this wallet upgrade has opened the door to a large number of onboarding routes into Osmosis for all users on the main front-end for the very first time. Similarly, Osmosis’s Binance listing has made it much easier for new users to purchase OSMO off-chain to use as a transaction fee if necessary.\n\nAs such, the time is ripe to implement a minimum transaction fee on Osmosis. The purpose of this proposal is to signal to Osmosis Labs and other key Osmosis development contributors that governance mandates a minimum gas price of 0.0025 uOSMO be implemented at the protocol level. There is currently no governance adjustable parameter to implement this fee, so this proposal will be implemented in a subsequent software upgrade.\n\nFurther, to the extent that fees need to be priced via the Transaction Fee Module in another asset, the transaction fee module should be amended to utilize Osmosis Time Weighted Average Pricing over at least a 24 hour period instead of the currently utilized spot pricing to ensure that validators are fairly compensated no matter which asset is used for fees\n\nFull discussion on this proposal can be found here: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level)",0.0021672549450098],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/AXL\n\n* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/AXL (#812) pool on Osmosis.\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/AXL (#812) pool on Osmosis.\n\n**Details**\nThis proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/AXL pool (#812).

This is an effective 30% reduction in current liquidity emissions.\n\nWhile Osmosis' contribution to a pool's APR from Liquidity Incentives is reduced, APR gained from Swap Fees, External Incentives and Superfluid Staking will be unaffected. This results in smaller APR changes in pools with already lower APR as follows:\n[APR Changes](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ea42ca02-ff4a-46e1-8a96-be95ed64c55f.1668435674138)\nJackal, stOSMO and Tori are cut off but have no changes as they are unincentivised by Osmosis at the time of writing.\n\nThis results in the following change to the Liquidity vs Staking chart, showing where pools are currently trending towards and where they would be trending towards after this reduction completes:\n[Current Trending vs Trending after Reduction](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a9ce040b-047f-45dd-abed-fd951cb66202.1668435703320)\n\nThis shows that even with this reduction, LP rewards will remain superior to alternative token uses whilst reducing the amount that Osmosis pays each day to continue to maintain and grow token liquidity.\n\nIn order to ensure this reduction goes smoothly, an informal group will be formed to oversee each step change. This group consists of\n* Chaos Labs (Incentives Optimisation Infrastructure)\n* Flipside Flan (Flipside)\n* Hathor Nodes (Validator & Incentives Optimisation Researcher)\n* Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Labs)\n* RedRabbit (Osmosis Community)\n\nBy a majority consensus, governance entrusts the five (5) member working group to use their best judgement to delay or halt the implementation of the second and or third 7% weekly redirection in order to ensure that this reduction in incentives does not negatively impact token liquidity. The working group DOES NOT have the ability to revert any redirections that have occurred or change the amount that is to be redirected so that it does not equal the 7% defined in this proposal. The working group will communicate to governance on Commonwealth on a weekly basis whether to expect the second and or third weekly redirection to be postponed due to any yet unforeseen extenuating circumstances.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7501-further-reduction-of-lp-emissions](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7501-further-reduction-of-lp-emissions)",0.02365320655208984],["Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match\n\n# Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match \n\n * By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/IST (#837) on Osmosis.\n * By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/IST (#837) on Osmosis.\n\n We plan to introduce a proposal to match internal incentives for Pool 837 - OSMO/IST which is currently incentivized with 300,000 BLD over 60 days.\n\n Inter Protocol’s IST token launched on 10/27 with the launch of Agoric’s JavaScript platform.  After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST.  IST liquidity will be incentivized through the Cosmos ecosystem, with Osmosis being a critical early destination.\n\n The authors believe that it would be in the best interests of the community to incentivize an OSMO-IST pool to drive deep eventual liquidity and easy access from any other Osmosis token \n\n Additionally, it is requested that IST be enabled and listed as an asset on app.osmosis.zone. The OSMO/IST pool should be listed as well in the main app.\n\n ## What is IST?\n\n IST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric’s unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric’s model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.\n\n For its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST.  Each PSM accepts another Cosmos stablecoin and mints IST in exchange.  There are currently four PSM contracts running, accepting USDC and USDT over both Axelar and Gravity bridges, each with different minting limits.  Rationale for the current minting limits was explained by the elected governance committee here: https://community.agoric.com/t/ist-minting-limits-for-inter-protocol-mvp-launch/87/1 \n\n Additional PSMs may be added by governance to accept new IBC-accessible stablecoins. \n]\n IST’s next iteration will include overcollateralized vaults, which will drive a major unlock for minting capability and allow the token to diversify away from bridge risk and stablecoin centralization risk.\n\n User Docs: https://docs.inter.trade/ \n Analytics: https://analytics.inter.trade/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/inter_protocol \n Discord Link: https://discord.com/invite/interprotocol",0.03746129466094417],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-11-21\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",0.009295972572992972],["Revive IBC Client to Dig\n\nRevive IBC Client to Dig after expiration caused by chain halt",0.11057518955475865],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-11-28\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",0.00726465422575943],["Signaling Proposal for stOSMO/OSMO (#833) Incentivised Pool\n\n- By voting **YES** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their support for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.\n\n- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.\n\n**Details**\n\nThis is a signaling proposal to add stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the stOSMO/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.\n\nstOSMO/OSMO (#833) is currently incentivized with STRD from the Stride Foundation, at a rate of 10,000 STRD per day. The Stride Foundation will continue incentivizing this pool for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf approved, OSMO incentives to the stOSMO pool would increase liquidity depth, allowing the pool to function as a stable oracle for the price of stOSMO and absorb stOSMO liquidations. If liquidity is deep enough, stOSMO will likely be a collateral option for these coming Osmosis applications: Mars, Membrane, Margined, and Levana. In addition, many applications throughout the Cosmos will likely use stOSMO as collateral - if the stOSMO pool is deep enough.\n\n**About Stride**\n\nStride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride has a huge emphasis on security, with a minimalist blockchain, rate limiting, and continual auditing. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations. As Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis, it makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the stOSMO pool to the set of incentivized pools.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread**\n\nhttps://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/7482-signaling-proposal-to-incentivize-strides-stosmo-osmo-pool",0.02109251291168442],["Osmosis v13 Fluorine upgrade proposal\n\nThis is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v13.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height [7241500](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/7241500), which is estimated to occur on Thursday December 8th, UTC 15:00.

Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.\n\nIf using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v13/bin/.\n\nIf not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v13.0.0 binary.\n\n## Details of Upgrade Time\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be [7241500](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/7241500), anticipated to be on Thursday December 8th, UTC 15:00. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown here.\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.\n",0.000858059169665859],["Match External Incentives to extended STARS/OSMO and ATOM/STARS pairs\n\nSTARS incentives to Osmosis pools have been proposed in [Stargaze Prop 80](https://www.mintscan.io/stargaze/proposals/80).

There is a price ratio they are expected to be at, and the AMM offers low slippage around this price.\nStableswaps are the most popular pools across DeFi, providing deep liquidity in an ecosystem with no impermanent loss and sustainable yield from maintaining the peg between the two assets.\nThese are therefore important for Osmosis to implement and will be implemented in v13.\n\n### Incentives Category\nA new incentives category is proposed: *Stable/Stable* \nThis category would include pools consisting of two, or more tokens which have been authorised as Stable assets and are pegged to the same currency.\ni.e. EEUR/USDC would not be not a qualifying pool\n\n### Incentives Allocation\nShares of incentives are currently allocated to each category up to its cap.\nStableswap pools are strategically important to Osmosis' growth, as can be seen from the dominant pairs on alternative exchanges, and so the allocation of incentives should be higher than typical for a non-OSMO pool.\n\nWith multiple new dollar stablecoins emerging recently and pending, allocating a fixed % of incentives to the category will hugely benefit those with existing liquidity to draw on, and penalise those taking a more measured approach to slowly build their market-cap, encouraging excessive levels of risk taking.\n\nTo incentivise these pools this proposal puts forward a new set of rules for the Stable/Stable category only.\n\n* The Stable/Stable category shall be allocated a maximum share of 4% of LP emissions.\n    * Any unused incentive allocation will be proportionately shared between alternative categories rather than being normalised into Stable/Stable.\n* Pools will be automatically accepted for the external incentive matching program based on the following criteria:\n    * Using the Stableswap curve.\n    * Less than or equal to 0.05% fees.\n    * Composed entirely of governance-authorised Stablecoins, or GAMM derivatives of other pools meeting these criteria.\n    * All assets are intended by their minting process to be at minimum soft-pegged to the same denomination.\n    * Receiving external incentives, \n        * of at least 100 OSMO in equivalent value per day.\n        * for an epoch length of at least 7 around the date of OSMO incentive allocation.\n* Pools receiving native incentives must meet the following criteria:\n    * Using the Stableswap curve.\n    * Less than or equal to 0.05% fees.\n    * Composed of two or more governance-authorised Stablecoins.\n    * All assets are intended by their minting process to be at minimum soft-pegged to the same denomination.\n    * Passed by Governance as a core stableswap pool.\n    * This proposal recommends that the number of core stableswap pools is kept low to prevent duplication of liquidity locations but allows for multiple to exist.\n* Stable/Stable pools will have no maturity rating.\n    * Incentive matching changes will therefore follow at a lag of 5-12 days depending on the time of addition/removal compared to the routine incentives proposal.\n    * This allows Osmosis incentives to adapt to external incentive and volume changes as rapidly as possible.\n* Incentives will be allocated as a fee subsidy in line with the current model, however as there is no normalisation this will be a direct value matching until the cap is reached.\n    * Pools with external incentives auto-matching will receive a target allocation of $1 to $1 in external incentives, capped at $1 per $1 fees generated.\n    * The Pool with native incentives will receive a target allocation of $2 per $1 generated and cease to have any external incentives matched while receiving native incentives.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7917-stableswap-incentive-structure](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7917-stableswap-incentive-structure)",0.003670449109247853],["Osmosis Support Lab Funding Round December 2022 -

Several of these pools, notably the WETH, WBTC, CRO, USDC and DAI pools have had high incentives compared to their hurdle rate and have never been a factor in choosing whether to proceed with the reduction due to being excessively incentivised compared to comparable rates.\n\nMonitoring the OSMO/MAJOR and OSMO/STABLE pool GAMM levels shows that very few liquidity providers have left these pools, however new liquidity providers are not being attracted. Meanwhile, the high inflation of Osmosis is causing token value to be diluted resulting in impermanent loss in all pools as can be seen by the paired tokens in the pools decreasing faster than the GAMM tokens representing liquidity provided.\n\n[Liquidity Provided to OSMO/ATOM](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0f6dbee3-f691-44cf-9bd1-59966aaa0585.1671358036254) vs [ATOM Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1f87e0ca-e53e-4571-aaa6-8f665dc31bbd.1671358050096)\n\n[Liquidity Provided to OSMO/USDC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a20b5c74-ed9f-4251-bb32-9a84bc6a9dab.1671358062801) vs [USDC Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/31edae52-0dbb-428a-adc5-d5eda5084423.1671358077128)\n\n[Liquidity Provided to OSMO/WETH](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0a01c7f9-1ebc-479b-a52e-f67421f6ff62.1671358088408) vs [WETH Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/7065b7aa-9d10-4c74-a2ba-17c5cbbd98ef.1671358098707)\n\n[Liquidity Provided to OSMO/WBTC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/639928d6-9d38-4e06-ac76-7f639f597f73.1671358111177) vs [WBTC Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bcdf5a18-8077-42e7-91c5-b8164f1addeb.1671358123040)\n\nThis proposal aims to set the incentive rate for all established Major and Stable pools to be approximately the comparable staking rate of each half of the pools, or the OSMO staking APR, plus a 5% premium to account for impermanent loss, at the current liquidity levels.\n\nThis aims to be a preliminary step to reduce inflation of the OSMO token until target liquidity levels can be set and further measures to reduce overall inflation can be implemented.\n\nThis results in only significant changes to the OSMO/MAJOR and OSMO/STABLE categories with the following estimated effect on APR:\n[APR Chart](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/d95dee12-403f-4607-88f5-bbcfdd494038.1671358004731)\n\nWhich compares to the comparable staking rate as follows:\n[Comparable Rates](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/04c3dc33-8ae0-45ab-8c64-1cc82cdb25af.1671358014300)\n\n## Current allocations\nCommunity pool share of OSMO LP Incentives: **50%**\nLeaving 50% emitted to Liquidity Providers - **123,288 OSMO/day**\n\n**Current category shares**\n* 45% OSMO/MAJOR - 60,966 OSMO/day\n* 30% OSMO/STABLE - 40,644 OSMO/day\n* 14% OSMO/MINOR - 18,967 OSMO/day\n* 2% OTHERS - 2,710 OSMO/day\n* Up to 4% Stable/Stable\n\nThese are further normalised to 100%\n\n**Current Minimums**\n* 9 OSMO/CRO: 3%\n* 704 OSMO/WETH: 10%\n* 712 OSMO/WBTC: 10%\n* 773 OSMO/DOT: 0.5%\n* 789 OSMO/MATIC: 0.5% with 4 week sunset\n\n**Current Maximum**\n* 1 OSMO/ATOM: 25%\n\n## Proposed Allocations\nCommunity pool share of OSMO LP Incentives: **70%**\nLeaving 30% emitted to Liquidity Providers - **73,973 OSMO/day**\n\n**Proposed category shares**\nThese are normalised to 100% if the Stable/Stable allocation is not used:\n* 54% OSMO/MAJOR - 39,945 OSMO/day (-21,021, or -34%)\n* 17% OSMO/STABLE - 12,575 OSMO/day (-28,069 or -69%)\n* 25% OSMO/MINOR - 18,493 OSMO/day (-474 or -2.5%)\n* Up to 4% Stable/Stable\n\nThe OTHERS Category is being voted on removal in [Proposal 389](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/389).

This contract will enable the IBCX portfolio to be automatically rebalanced upon the ION DAO on-chain governance result. \nBy deploying these contracts, ION DAO dev contributors will be able to release IBCX on Osmosis, and users will be able to utilize the Mint, Burn, and Rebalancing features on [https://index.ion.wtf](https://index.ion.wtf). \n# About IBCX \nIBCX is a Cosmos index token that’s designed to benchmark the leading Cosmos tokens’ performances. It aims to achieve this by procuring and maintaining those tokens as its collateral. IBCX price is dynamically calculated based on the spot prices of its selected components, or the collateralized Cosmos tokens. The weight % of each token is determined and periodically rebalanced based on the ION DAO’s governance voting results. ION is a native token of Osmosis, and ION DAO plans to fully utilize the liquidity of Cosmos’s #1 AMM to ensure the successful operation of IBCX. \n\nOsmosis’s ION DAO governs IBCX, and it aims to provide new opportunities to the Cosmos Ecosystem. \n## Operation: Rebalancing \nIBCX aims to represent the fundamental values of the Cosmos ecosystem. Therefore, it's imperative to keep its portfolio updated and as a **best representation** of Cosmos. The initial portfolio should and will change accordingly, and we'll call this process portfolio rebalancing. ION DAO will be responsible for this process after IBCX launches. \n\nWe explained above that the token quantities in a unit of IBCX are held constant to ensure the fungibility of the index token. \n\nTherefore, ION DAO proposals on IBCX rebalancing will change the quantities, whether adding, reducing, or completely removing. \n\nAfter the passing of each rebalancing proposal, the rebalancing logic will perform swaps of the portfolio tokens on Osmosis to match the newly decided weight %s. The dev contributor team will propose viable solutions to avoid a significant impact on the token prices deriving from large trades, such as maintaining specific intervals between the swaps. \n\nION holders essentially decide the future of IBCX by directly participating in the portfolio rebalancing process via ION DAO. ION holders will be able to vote on ongoing proposals and propose new rebalancing ideas of their own. We wish and expect to see a vibrant community of Cosmonauts collaborating and freely debating on ION DAO to decide the assets that best represent the Cosmos and the future of interchain. \n\n## How Does the Rebalancing Work?\nRebalancing is the most crucial part of IBCX’s operation. Thus, anyone from ION DAO will be able to upload a rebalancing proposal besides the ION DAO dev contributors. \n\nAfter the rebalancing proposal is passed, the rebalancing contract will automatically swap underlying assets according to the newly determined portfolio. \n\n## Rebalancing Process\nThe IBCX portfolio will be adjusted based on ION DAO on-chain governance results every three months. Please refer to the rebalancing process below. \n* ION DAO dev contributors will remind of the upcoming rebalancing date 15 days in advance before the next rebalancing. \n* ION DAO dev contributors and anyone can create a Commonwealth thread to discuss the next rebalancing details during the 15 days. \n  * Commonwealth thread will be mainly used to have conversations regarding each rebalancing. \n  * The thread will contain the portfolio at the moment. You are welcome to join and drop comments. \n* On the rebalancing date (after 15 days from the initial announcement), ION DAO dev contributors will make on-chain governance, including on-chain messages to run the rebalancing. \n  * We assume that the ION DAO dev contributors will usually do it, but anyone can also upload an on-chain proposal if they want. \n* If passed, the IBCX contract will automatically swap underlying assets according to the newly determined portfolio. \n* Assuming that the first portfolio was 50% ATOM, 40% OSMO, and 10% ION \n* If the rebalancing proposal suggesting to change the portfolio to 50% ATOM, 50% OSMO, and 0% ION, the contract will swap ION to OSMO to equalize the ratio. \n* The next rebalancing date will be set up three months after the end of each rebalancing. \n* If it’s not passed, ION DAO dev contributors will upload a modified proposal again based on community feedback. Each rebalancing could be skipped if ION DAO does not want to execute it at the moment. \n\n## Details \n\n* Rebalancing Cycle: Rebalancing should be reviewed by ION DAO governance at least every quarter. \n* Rebalancing Period: It depends on market conditions. We expect it will take up to 14 days to complete each rebalancing as each step is designed to minimise the slippage for the overall rebalance. \n* Please note that you can’t both mint and burn during the rebalancing period. Instead, you have to trade on [https://app.osmosis.zone/](https://app.osmosis.zone/). \n* The service provider should announce each rebalancing date 15 days in advance at least. \n* All details regarding the execution of each rebalancing of the IBCX portfolio depend on ION DAO on-chain governance result. Please note that the rebalancing schedule could be changed based on the ION DAO governance status. \n* Rebalancing the IBCX portfolio could be executed immediately (some steps could be skipped) due to requests from the ION DAO community and fluctuations in the market, even if there are remaining dates until the next rebalancing. ION DAO will confirm the details in those cases as well. \n\n## Operation: Fees\nThe dev contributor team will continue to be responsible for leading the operation of IBCX. We propose to charge an annual Management Fee of 0.55% on the total quantities of the collateral tokens to cover the operating costs. A IBCX smart contract will incur this fee on every block and allocate 30% for the operation costs and the rest (70%) to the ION Treasury. \n\nIn addition, we propose imposing another fee of 0.15% on the burning of IBCX. This fee is to be used as a safeguard to protect the IBCX price from sudden sell pressure in the market. We emphasize that there will be no extra fees for selling IBCX on any of the IBCX pools available on Osmosis. Like the Management Fee, 30% of the incurred Burn Fee will be allocated for the operation costs and 70% to the ION Treasury. \n\nThe contract will send the all collected fees to the [ION DAO Treasury](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo1k8re7jwz6rnnwrktnejdwkwnncte7ek7gt29gvnl3sdrg9mtnqkse6nmqm) first. \n\n## Mint Fee\nThere will initially be no fee to mint IBCX. \n\n## Streaming Fee\n IBCX’s annual streaming fee is 0.55%. The streaming fee will be charged every second based on the fee rate and how long users hold IBCX. \n\nThis means that users can only burn the amount of IBCX they have held minus the streaming fee. The streaming fee will be paid by every token in the IBCX portfolio. \n\nAbout a 0.55 fee will be charged as the streaming fee if you hold a 100 value of IBCX for 1 year. \n\n## Burn Fee\nBurn fee will be charged at the moment users burn IBCX. They will pay the burn fee with IBCX before receiving OSMO (or USDC or ATOM). After that, they will receive OSMO (or USDC or ATOM) in IBCX equivalent minus that burn fee. The burn fee will be paid with IBCX.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread**:[https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9807-contract-proposal-ibcx-mintburnrebalancing-contracts](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9807-contract-proposal-ibcx-mintburnrebalancing-contracts)",0.0033941802028510195],["ARB Bootstrapping liquidity incentives\n\nThis proposal would add OSMO incentives directly to the ARB/OSMO pool (#1011) consisting of 0.5% of liquidity incentives and maintain this for a period of 4 routine incentive proposals.\n\n## Details\nThis proposal would provide initial incentives on the 16th of May by actioning the following:\n* Directly allocating 0.5% of incentives to the ARB/OSMO pool (#1011)\n* Set Minimum incentives for the ARB/OSMO (#1011) pool of 0.5% for 4 routine proposals to retain this level of liquidity incentives while liquidity is built.\n\nBootstrapping incentives indicate that Osmosis stakers wish to quickly establish functional liquidity of ARB to facilitate trading and liquidity flow between Arbitrum and Osmosis via the Axelar bridge.\n\n## About Arbitrum\nArbitrum is an Ethereum L2, optimistic rollup.

The contract will be its own owner, but can accept messages from Wormhole governance to set configuration parameters. \n\n ## Contract information (Wormhole): \n\nThe release for the contract is available at - [https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/releases/tag/v2.14.9](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/releases/tag/v2.14.9) \nThe git commit Id - [https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/commit/ae7de3d575a0cee7ceaf69080952fa148dc0a346](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/commit/ae7de3d575a0cee7ceaf69080952fa148dc0a346) \nThe code can be found at - [https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/ae7de3d575a0cee7ceaf69080952fa148dc0a346/cosmwasm/contracts/wormhole](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/ae7de3d575a0cee7ceaf69080952fa148dc0a346/cosmwasm/contracts/wormhole) \nCompiler Version - cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.11 \nChecksum - ca4dead04cffc986bb05b9fa792327ac4ea2609ec928ef44dd7f48d3e16995f5 wormhole-2.14.9.wasm \n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/11242-proposal-upload-pyth-network-contract](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/11242-proposal-upload-pyth-network-contract)",0.013655837364974924],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2023-05-15\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",0.06286517032592225],["Update Lambda IBC Client on Osmosis\n\nDue to a relayer issue that resulted in ibc client expired. this proposal will reactivate the expired IBC client 07-tendermint-2217 with client 07-tendermint-2781.",0.005124103536562896],["Suitdrop Commonwealth Proposal\n\n## \"Suitdrop\" = spacesuit + merchdrop\n\n### Definitions\n\nThe lower-case \"suitdrop\" is used generically to mean merchandise drops of anyone or any team that would want to use these primitives for their communities where each each physical item will have its own NFT associated with it. For there to be liquidity available to anyone who wants to purchase a physical merch, one primitive is the bonding curve.\n\nThe upper-case Suitdrop is used to refer to the brand.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis is a proposal from Interchain.FM to deploy two new primitives to the Osmosis mainnet:\n1. The automation of minting/burning of tokens meant for physical merchandise redemption. Once a token is burned and a physical merch is redeemed, minter receives a NFT associated with the unique merch item.\n2. A bonding curve that uses $OSMO as the base token to buy the redemption token in #1.\n\nWhen composed together, what you get is an automated Unisocks mechanism implemented on a bonding curve. Once live, if this prop passes, the bonding curve will use the Cosmwasmpool spec #4810 by Boss Supanat Potiwarakorn to seamlessly integrate with the Osmosis frontend to give you the same great UX of the AMM that you’re familiar with.\n\nUnisocks was a one-off experiment by Uniswap Labs. While they successfully proved the concept, they left an opportunity void by not taking the concept to its logical conclusion—designing a framework to allow anyone to implement it for any merch on its AMM. We think that this use case can lend to greater trading volume as well as provide a lower bound of demand for the Osmosis chain, positioned as the preferred AMM for suitdrops/unisocks of any appchain.\n\n### Proposed roadmap\n\nMay 31—shirt signing period closes\nJune 1—airdrop snapshot taken\nJune 2—$SHIRT drop (minting starts, place shirt orders on [suitdrop.zone](http://www.suitdrop.zone/))\nJune 2—Bonding Curve Opens (the earlier the redemption, the more cost effective the shirt)\nFuture TBD (ETA: Q1/Q2 ‘24)—Suitdrop-as-a-Service\n\nNow that you understand the value proposition for Osmosis and future users of this framework, here’s how Interchain.FM intends to leverage these contracts, once on-chain.\n\nWe intend to achieve two goals by implementing Suitdrop:\n1. Prove the idea\n2. Provide a playbook\n\nFind the Suitdrop repository here: [(https://github.com/SuitDrop/cw-tokens/tree/v0.14.2/contracts/cw20-merkle-airdrop)](https://github.com/SuitDrop/cw-tokens/tree/v0.14.2/contracts/cw20-merkle-airdrop)\n\nChecksum of cw20_merkle_airdrop.wasm: 8b7c74905b53fc0bf3de79d3832e3fc8ff9bcccbb18bce557e6df04dd49b4a60\n\n### Tokenomics\n\nThe first (of many) suitdrops will be a drop of a limited edition batch of exclusive Cosmos tees. Cosmos is a community-first ecosystem, and as such, you get to put your unique imprint on the tee. When you [#signtheshirt](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20am%20signing%20this%20shirt%20to%20show%20my%20support%20for%20the%20upcoming%20Shirtdrop%20on%20%40SuitdropZone!%0A%0ASign%20yours%20too%20over%20at%20https%3A%2F%2Fsuitdrop.zone%2F%20so%20your%20PFP%20can%20be%20added%20to%20the%20shirt!%0A%0AOsmocon%20Paris%20here%20we%20come!&url=https://twitter.com/SuitdropZone/status/undefined), your PFP is collected which will then get printed onto the physical tee. (Current shirt design displayed on [suitdrop.zone](http://www.suitdrop.zone/) is a sample placeholder and not the final design of the shirt.)\n\nThere will be 500 total $SHIRT tokens in existence, 100 of which will be available for free mints to the top 100 stakers who either 1) stake with Interchain.FM on Osmosis, or 2) is currently staked with a top 20 Osmosis validator and instantly redelegates to a bottom 20 Osmosis validator or Interchain.FM. Make Osmosis decentralized again ;)\n\n$SHIRT has one and only one utility. It’s a redemption token for a physical Cosmos tee. A Cosmos tee can only be redeemed with a $SHIRT. 1 $SHIRT = 1 tee. The snapshot for the recipients of the 100 free mint will be taken on May 23rd. In order to prevent Sybil-attacks attempting to game this suitdrop, only the top 100 accounts ranked in order by staked voting power will get to mint a $SHIRT.\n\n### FAQ\n1. Why is it called the \"suitdrop\"? \n\nWait and see! 😉\n\n2. What is Suitdrop-as-a-Service?\n\nThe last item on the roadmap, SaaS, is a permissionless service for automating merchandise drops that various appchains could use. [suitdrop.zone](http://www.suitdrop.zone/) will be turned into a storefront for anyone to spin up their own merch stores without having to build and maintain bespoke ones from scratch. If you’re Akash, you could have your merch store under suitdrop.zone/akash. Suitdrop-as-a-service lets projects, artists, and individuals submit custom designs to Suitdrop, which is fully integrated with fulfillers covering 3 continents (North America, Europe, and Australia).\n\n### CTA\n\nIf you want your PFP to show up on the first suitdrop tee, then [#signtheshirt](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20am%20signing%20this%20shirt%20to%20show%20my%20support%20for%20the%20upcoming%20Shirtdrop%20on%20%40SuitdropZone!%0A%0ASign%20yours%20too%20over%20at%20https%3A%2F%2Fsuitdrop.zone%2F%20so%20your%20PFP%20can%20be%20added%20to%20the%20shirt!%0A%0AOsmocon%20Paris%20here%20we%20come!&url=https://twitter.com/SuitdropZone/status/undefined).\n\n### Voting Options\n1.

These tools allow users to modify recurring swap amounts and actions based on relevant data; for example, modify swap amount as a linear transformation based on a custom multiplier relevant to asset price.

Additionally, it allows users to take actions post-swap such as autostaking of OSMO, or lending accepted assets to Mars protocol. \n\nGovernance approval for contract upload was originally intended to keep the set of DApps running on Osmosis consistent with its objective of being a DeFi hub for the Interchain and as Calculated Finance is a perfect complimentary product to this vision it is reasonable to grant contract upload permissions. \n\nWhile this proposal gives authority for osmo1r02tlyyaqs6tmrfa4jf37t7ewuxr57qp8ghzly to permissionlessly upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis, governance only signals approval for contracts relating to the function of Calculated Finance’s swap and auxiliary swap products. \n# About Calculated Finance\nCalculated Finance is building the smartest way to enter and exit positions complimented with pre and post-swap actions to save time and counter emotional decision-making.

The same event that caused UST to lose peg also caused $LUNA value to crash.

Probably not. \nBUT if the staking rewards are high (Over 100% APR) then it gives people a reason to stake, an opportunity to rebuild their losses over time. \nOn top of this, high staking rewards attracts new users therefore new buyers, driving price of the new token. \nIt benefits Everyone.

Agreement that Wash Trading will be penalised by Osmosis Governance in forms such as, but not limited to: \n - Early completion of the onboarding period to limit the effectiveness of any wash trading \n - Manual fixing of a pool's incentives to be in line with its TVL \n - Full removal of incentives from a pool. \n\n 2. Reduction in the effectiveness of Wash Trading by limiting the Swap Fee used in the subsidy model to 3x the average swap fee across Osmosis \n - This limits the APRs caused by irregular trading whilst also still maintaining high APRs in genuinely popular pools. \n\n 3.

Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \n\n## Upgrade features\n\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n* Superfluid Staking\n* Permissioned CosmWasm\n* IAVL improvements (improved epoch times)\n* UX improvements around LP bonding\n\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v7.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\nAll nodes will require 64GB of memory. This must consist of a **minimum** of 32GB of RAM, while the remaining 32GB can be swap. For best results, use 64GB of physical memory. Note that this is **double the recommendation for the Boron upgrade**. Also note that the inclusion of wasm means that nodes must use amd64 to run.\n\nPlease refer to the following setup instructions on how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md).\n\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you should install the v1.0.0 release of cosmovisor) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v7.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin/`.\n\nIf you do not wish to use cosmovisor, be prepared to upgrade at around 8:00PM UTC, February 28th if this proposal passes.\n\nThe Osmosis blockchain will halt when network reaches the halt height. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v7.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\n## Details of upgrade time\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `3401000`, anticipated to be at `Monday February 28th 8:00PM UTC`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.46 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 120 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\n\n\n### Superfluid delegation \n\nIn this upgrade\"s superfluid module, you can stake LP shares for specific governance-approved pools. A \"superfluid discount factor\" parameter exists for the superfluid module to ensure stability in the early rollout of superfluid staking, the superfluid discount factor parameter is set to 50% in this upgrade. This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.\n\nThe user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.\n\nHere is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:\n\n#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing\n*Condition*\n- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.\n- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.\n- Suppose you have designated validator \"Dogemosis\" as your superfluid validator.\n- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%\n\n*Result*\n- Your delegation to \"Dogemosis\" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.\n- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.\n- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares.

negatively affecting our climate. Regen Network, in partnership with Toucan and Moss.Earth, have already launched a version of NCT on Polygon at a price of $10 per credit.\nThis proposal asks for a spend of 6,600 $OSMO from the Community Pool to purchase 5,100 NCT from Regen Network to cover Osmosis’ historical carbon emissions, confirming Osmosis' carbon neutrality blockchain up to June 2022.\n\nMethod\n These funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of \nCory Levinson (Regen Network)\nJohnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)\nNosNode (Osmosis Validator)\n\nThe $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase NCT. This will then be retired to offset Osmosis’ carbon emissions.\nAny $OSMO remaining due to price fluctuations below the intentional 20% buffer to mitigate any price volatility, and a potentially lower NCT cost, will be returned to the Osmosis Community Pool.\n\nDiscussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3936-proposal-osmosis-carbon-market-with-regen-network",0.031080984205835566],["Match External Incentives for SWTH/OSMO\n\n\n**Proposal Details**\n\nMatch external incentives provided by Carbon for [SWTH/OSMO (#651)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/651).

Due to Osmosis paying for liquidity based on fees, any fees generated by trading in this pool would result in Osmosis paying to incentivize liquidity that is not needed due to the unbonded protocol liquidity. This instead can act as a source of both tokens to seed other, incentivized pools, to increase liquidity and so stability of both NCT and REGEN across Osmosis as a whole through arbitrage.\nAs an added benefit, based on average swap fees, around 5,400 NCT would be acquired by this community pool held liquidity per year. A portion of this can be routinely retired and cause Osmosis’ carbon neutrality to be self-sustaining.\nThe remaining REGEN will be used to incentivize the NCT/OSMO pool to attract deeper liquidity, an arbitrage option for NCT/REGEN and a route to the Osmosis base pair for ease of trading. Around 165,000 REGEN should remain in the community pool after the previous two proposals, providing incentives of approximately $1,500 per day for 90 days.\nIncluding a 20% buffer for price volatility, this proposal asks for a community pool spend of 140,000 $OSMO and 1,399,507 $REGEN to establish the Osmosis’ community pool share of this liquidity.\nIn order to ensure that supply and demand do not place an artificial premium on NCT, the pools will only become available on Osmosis once the ability to tokenise existing offchain carbon credits, non-custodially bridge NCT from Polygon across to the IBC and retire NCT on Regen is fully available to the average user through frontend tooling. This spend is being requested early as the cost of a Carbon Credit has recently been lower than usual and so Osmosis will be able to purchase this liquidity at a reduced rate in preparation for a coordinated launch.\n\nBenefits to Osmosis\n The spend would be retained in the community pool as protocol owned liquidity and so no value should be lost from this proposal.\nSwap fees in this pool, at Osmosis average, would generate around $54,000 in revenue each year for the protocol.\n Retiring a portion of this revenue each year will ensure that Osmosis remains carbon neutral permanently.\n Through encouraging use of the Regen Network, the value of Osmosis protocol owned liquidity will increase to cater for projects yet to be connected via IBC. \n\nMethod\nThese funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of \n   Cory Levinson (Regen Network)\n   Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)\n    Nos Node (Osmosis Validator)\n\nThe $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase the NCT.\nThe NCT and any remaining $OSMO will then be returned to the multisig address on Osmosis.\n200 $OSMO will then be used to establish NCT/REGEN and a OSMO/NCT pool on Osmosis. These costs are paid into the community pool.\nAll of the $NCT will then be paired with $REGEN in a ratio to maintain the purchase price of $NCT.\nThe GAMM tokens for NCT/REGEN will then be returned, unbonded, to the Osmosis Community Pool, along with any remaining $OSMO tokens.\nAny remaining REGEN will be loaded as external incentives on the OSMO/NCT pool over a 90 day period, start time to be determined when NCT on Regen is fully live.\n\nDiscussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3936-proposal-osmosis-carbon-market-with-regen-network",0.004614568770356597],["Increase Voting Period to 5 days\n\nVoting Yes to this proposal raises the governance parameter Voting_Period to five days./n/nVoting No to this proposal causes the governance parameter Voting_Period to remain at three days./n/nBackground/nThree day voting periods have enabled rapid change, something integral to the experimental spirit of Osmosis. The short voting period allows patches to be deployed rapidly, rapid iteration of proposals to find an acceptable choice as well as the incentives allocated to pools to be adjusted in response to recent volume changes.\nHowever, the submission of a proposal to chain sparks debate from those who may not have had the opportunity to feedback on the proposal's wording and intent due to other commitments. The three day voting period gives a sense of urgency to debate with voters potentially unable to impartially weigh both sides. This is further exacerbated by proposals which are put to chain on the weekend which minimises the work days that validators and delegators have to research and discuss whilst on chain. Proposals posted on commonwealth often have issues that appear when exposed to this wider audience that need to be resolved./nThere is a github issue that would allow the best of both worlds, but this takes time to develop from an already busy development schedule. https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/567/nRaising the voting time from a three day period to a five day period will allow more thorough discussion to occur on proposals put on chain in exchange for lowering the speed of governance changes on Osmosis./n/nCommonwealth Post: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3929-proposal-increase-param-voting_period-to-5-days",0.013605967482266057],["Semi-Automatic Incentive Adjustments for 03/28/2022\n\nAdjustment Proposal in accordance with model of Prop 54 \n\n Static copy of spreadsheet with data used to generate proposal: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aYyFC_BMPI2oOXMvoWYALCAsHsXwvjHKzlDeiaCe528/edit?usp=sharing\n\nMain auto updating sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1el4vImD9KqerdiUBbjG2tz_84Sx7XIxy2Lpg6HC5qrU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOnboarding for pool 649 (prop 180)\nMatching incentives for pool 651 (prop 178)\nThis adjustment also implicitly grants regular incentive onboarding to pool 651, as otherwise the caps of prop 133 would result in nullifying the effects of prop 178\n\n\nCurrent Osmo per day:\n\n1, 98586.60333\n2, 983.9673014\n3, 1087.047711\n4, 399.6158417\n5, 967.196178\n6, 259.6744834\n7, 225.4086345\n8, 128.0775729\n9, 2595.889668\n10, 645.6504254\n13, 698.9338533\n15, 1321.823703\n22, 115.7960717\n42, 182.9595036\n183, 10.09753849\n197, 53.19791126\n461, 49.67857374\n463, 522.0690528\n464, 10.47907415\n481, 1501.181642\n482, 390.2057252\n497, 35547.74946\n498, 11056.29813\n548, 39.39026742\n549, 1.437336912\n553, 140.8096809\n555, 24.95111629\n557, 11.64341572\n558, 7.860950161\n560, 99540.9753\n561, 40315.04407\n562, 22709.08778\n565, 1148.389435\n567, 252.8331544\n571, 678.0349088\n572, 102.7646556\n573, 221.0736001\n574, 63.68356361\n577, 1284.788432\n578, 389.903128\n579, 0\n580, 33.93693881\n584, 5390.671241\n585, 1135.782312\n586, 236.4008083\n587, 196.161953\n592, 57.27639586\n596, 17.41249797\n597, 35.84132799\n600, 1186.378545\n601, 3167.555067\n602, 103.8434805\n604, 10961.01618\n605, 2970.376782\n606, 1025.995427\n608, 366.3860595\n610, 60.60496555\n611, 1621.908075\n612, 696.6380611\n613, 70.56436182\n615, 12.8735393\n616, 6.591357374\n617, 8.804922001\n618, 165.1194226\n619, 1151.241085\n621, 160.9718669\n625, 1897.021596\n626, 76.5110555\n627, 813.3320573\n629, 3880.500488\n631, 2863.477727\n637, 407.7399199\n638, 69.0250628\n641, 837.2536851\n642, 101.5246647\n643, 57.92105956\n644, 40.66643841\n645, 4.374503646\n648, 411.9401013\n649, 0\n651, 0\n\n\nProposed Osmo per day:\n\n\n1, 99657.48523\n2, 1079.002554\n3, 1192.033933\n4, 438.2123644\n5, 1060.605266\n6, 284.7523775\n7, 247.1790807\n8, 140.4488538\n9, 2749.703417\n10, 469.8836036\n13, 766.4368517\n15, 1449.482399\n22, 126.9834668\n42, 200.6310222\n183, 11.07730876\n197, 53.06335896\n461, 52.29112712\n463, 572.4898529\n464, 11.49262672\n481, 1421.549022\n482, 347.6925168\n497, 34865.22257\n498, 10172.37635\n548, 28.61151396\n549, 1.576910386\n553, 154.407431\n555, 30.09757354\n557, 12.77102732\n558, 8.621092378\n560, 100333.7007\n561, 40678.33723\n562, 18142.98995\n565, 1259.302464\n567, 236.9129398\n571, 743.5197363\n572, 112.6906885\n573, 209.4889756\n574, 41.90168873\n577, 1408.87209\n578, 427.5633523\n579, 0\n580, 22.71270103\n584, 5416.083667\n585, 1137.127601\n586, 225.2321221\n587, 147.8921304\n592, 37.68361569\n596, 19.0981369\n597, 39.30595147\n600, 1179.074715\n601, 3398.426828\n602, 113.8749936\n604, 12019.61979\n605, 3257.251168\n606, 1127.25082\n608, 401.7747026\n610, 66.45736322\n611, 1778.553746\n612, 1024.777603\n613, 46.43125025\n615, 9.357632826\n616, 4.338125897\n617, 9.656142611\n618, 181.0656526\n619, 1262.427083\n621, 105.9125696\n625, 2104.675686\n626, 88.03118453\n627, 535.1307044\n629, 4255.276453\n631, 2602.424529\n637, 447.1189879\n638, 75.69169853\n641, 918.1155139\n642, 111.3311711\n643, 63.51769077\n644, 53.10229501\n645, 5.86636621\n648, 459.9192172\n649, 47.32677961\n651, 617.9671697\n",0.01934845553623014],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS, OSMO/SCRT and OSMO/CRO\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS (#604), OSMO/SCRT (#584) and OSMO/CRO (#9) pools on Osmosis. \n\n By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS (#604), OSMO/SCRT (#584) and OSMO/CRO (#9) pools on Osmosis. \n\n Details \n This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in three additional OSMO pools.

This would result in cheaper transactions for all trades no matter the volume being traded as well as a higher proportion of the costs going to swap fees and so liquidity providers rather than being lost to slippage.\nOSMO pools currently used in multi-hop transactions would see lower fees generated per trade, but counter-intuitively, the total swap fees generated over time will increase due to the lower fees per transaction encouraging a much higher volume of trades due to a phenomenon known as volatility harvesting.\n\nMore information and discussion on Commonwealth: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4175-multihop-discount-on-osmosis-pools",0.0015951935334545715],["Semi-Automatic Incentive Adjustments for 04/03/2022\n\nAdjustment Proposal in accordance with model of Prop 54 \n\n Static copy of spreadsheet with data used to generate proposal: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MV7fHP0iOiltjRhWS57WqwMDBqTNtYV-TlsKzYGYxJA/edit?usp=sharing\n\nMain auto updating sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1el4vImD9KqerdiUBbjG2tz_84Sx7XIxy2Lpg6HC5qrU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNo changes this week\n\nCurrent Osmo per day:\n\n1, 99657.48523\n2, 1079.002554\n3, 1192.033933\n4, 438.2123644\n5, 1060.605266\n6, 284.7523775\n7, 247.1790807\n8, 140.4488538\n9, 2749.703417\n10, 469.8836036\n13, 766.4368517\n15, 1449.482399\n22, 126.9834668\n42, 200.6310222\n183, 11.07730876\n197, 53.06335896\n461, 52.29112712\n463, 572.4898529\n464, 11.49262672\n481, 1421.549022\n482, 347.6925168\n497, 34865.22257\n498, 10172.37635\n548, 28.61151396\n549, 1.576910386\n553, 154.407431\n555, 30.09757354\n557, 12.77102732\n558, 8.621092378\n560, 100333.7007\n561, 40678.33723\n562, 18142.98995\n565, 1259.302464\n567, 236.9129398\n571, 743.5197363\n572, 112.6906885\n573, 209.4889756\n574, 41.90168873\n577, 1408.87209\n578, 427.5633523\n579, 0\n580, 22.71270103\n584, 5416.083667\n585, 1137.127601\n586, 225.2321221\n587, 147.8921304\n592, 37.68361569\n596, 19.0981369\n597, 39.30595147\n600, 1179.074715\n601, 3398.426828\n602, 113.8749936\n604, 12019.61979\n605, 3257.251168\n606, 1127.25082\n608, 401.7747026\n610, 66.45736322\n611, 1778.553746\n612, 1024.777603\n613, 46.43125025\n615, 9.357632826\n616, 4.338125897\n617, 9.656142611\n618, 181.0656526\n619, 1262.427083\n621, 105.9125696\n625, 2104.675686\n626, 88.03118453\n627, 535.1307044\n629, 4255.276453\n631, 2602.424529\n637, 447.1189879\n638, 75.69169853\n641, 918.1155139\n642, 111.3311711\n643, 63.51769077\n644, 53.10229501\n645, 5.86636621\n648, 459.9192172\n649, 47.32677961\n651, 617.9671697\n\n\nProposed Osmo per day:\n\n\n1, 101164.7903\n2, 1298.716155\n3, 1434.761822\n4, 527.4440652\n5, 1276.57134\n6, 342.7353617\n7, 297.5090809\n8, 169.0492062\n9, 3309.606448\n10, 565.5653433\n13, 922.5000263\n15, 1744.628978\n22, 152.8412526\n42, 218.5278045\n183, 9.993302141\n197, 58.39279469\n461, 47.8545976\n463, 689.0606195\n464, 11.83810988\n481, 1711.009316\n482, 418.4900052\n497, 38480.84458\n498, 11740.44903\n548, 34.43878535\n549, 1.901790215\n553, 111.5075873\n555, 27.31597556\n557, 15.37102354\n558, 10.37793387\n560, 95244.19681\n561, 34900.54287\n562, 20263.3753\n565, 1515.726801\n567, 285.1545673\n571, 582.2540866\n572, 101.4893553\n573, 171.8164179\n574, 50.43305475\n577, 1695.752257\n578, 514.626569\n579, 0\n580, 27.33734399\n584, 6518.923734\n585, 1368.672832\n586, 271.0941408\n587, 147.3353206\n592, 30.99134541\n596, 19.16035835\n597, 47.30970265\n600, 977.3207318\n601, 2832.456543\n602, 137.0642289\n604, 9294.169868\n605, 3797.657814\n606, 982.3494356\n608, 483.5889253\n610, 79.98915399\n611, 1490.540546\n612, 1233.446288\n613, 33.53418851\n615, 9.815231896\n616, 5.221019579\n617, 11.62442558\n618, 215.0269435\n619, 1284.990501\n621, 83.45083955\n625, 1396.498088\n626, 88.39406954\n627, 644.0943212\n629, 5121.748979\n631, 2567.829913\n637, 538.163894\n638, 91.10429867\n641, 1105.068325\n642, 134.0014207\n643, 75.36645043\n644, 66.04981522\n645, 7.357862517\n648, 430.2889397\n649, 58.8379703\n651, 474.2722901\n",0.008976281334655703],["Signalling Proposal for SWTH/OSMO(#651) Incentivized Pools\n\nProposal for adding base OSMO rewards to the SWTH/OSMO (#651) pool.

As a custom-purposed blockchain, Carbon is designed specifically to allow trading of sophisticated financial instruments such as options, bonds and futures at scale. Developers can also build any kind of DeFi application on top of Carbon, while enjoying multi-chain interoperability. Carbon is currently integrated across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Zilliqa, Neo, as well as any IBC-compatible chain such as Osmosis, Terra, and Cosmos Hub. Carbon currently powers decentralized, cross-chain order-book trading of spot and futures markets on Demex.\n\nSince the addition of the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis last month, the pool has already garnered over USD 1.72m in liquidity, with a 7D average trading volume of USD 137k.\n\nVia Carbon governance, additional SWTH rewards have been allocated to the OSMO/BUSD spot liquidity pool on Carbon, as well as the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis.\n\nWebsite: [https://carbon.network](https://carbon.network)\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/0xcarbon](https://twitter.com/0xcarbon)\nTelegram: [https://t.me/switcheo](https://t.me/switcheo)\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/invite/SPh62Hf](https://discord.com/invite/SPh62Hf)",0.23552469442365143],["Match External Incentives to extended STARS/OSMO and ATOM/STARS pairs\n\nSTARS incentives to Osmosis pools have been proposed in [Stargaze Prop 23](https://www.mintscan.io/stargaze/proposals/23).

VETO and ABSTAIN have their normal functions.\n\nLIMITATION OF SCOPE: A YES vote assents to these procedures ONLY for the series of five Osmosis governance proposals outlined below. To guard against malicious or confusing proposals, only proposals made by osmo19mywfjzj324w5ukf7ss6jak0dg9hnljfp0rfx4 will be considered under these rules. Future use of these (or similar) procedures must be separately approved by governance.\n\nAPPROVAL VOTING PROCEDURES: Five Osmosis Governance Proposals will be proposed under these rules, one each for the four bridge service providers being voted upon: 1) Axelar, 2) Gravity Bridge, 3) Nomad, and 4) Wormhole, as well as 5) a “do nothing” proposal.\n\nWINNER: The Bridge Service Provider (BSP) proposal (or “do nothing”) from this set that receives the highest total amount of YES voting power at the end of the collective voting period will win, provided that QUORUM is reached and a RUN-OFF is not activated. That BSP will enter into a relationship with Osmosis DAO whose initial parameters are outlined below.\n\nNO, NO WITH VETO, and ABSTAIN votes will have NO EFFECT on the tally of yes voting power for the approval voting results. In other words, a bridge could win the approval vote even if it has more NO/VETO vote power than YES, as long as it has the most YES voting power among the BSP proposals.\n\nQUORUM: As long as the total YES voting power received across the 5 approval voting proposals is equivalent to regular Osmosis quorum (20% of total Osmosis voting power), quorum will be considered to have been reached.\n\nRUN-OFF: At the end of the collective voting period, any BSP or “do nothing” proposal that has received within 15% of the leading proposal’s total will be entered into a run-off governed by these same rules and expectations, except that the run-off result will be final, with no further run-offs. This 15% will be measured as a percentage of the total voting power available on Osmosis for this set of proposals (NOT 15% of the top vote-getter’s YES voting power).\nFor example, assuming 122M total staked OSMO available to vote, the 15% run-off spread is 18.3M. Therefore, if Bridge X gets 53M YES voting power, Bridge Y gets 35M, and Bridge Z gets 25M, Bridges X and Y will be entered into a run-off.\n\nBRIDGE SERVICE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP EXPECTATIONS:\nThe Osmosis DAO is asking Osmosis Labs to integrate the BSP into app.osmosis.zone to provide canonical, unprefixed bridged assets from Ethereum. The implementation details will be left to Osmosis Labs and the chosen BSP, but the general shape of the initial expectations is as follows. These expectations are subject to change as circumstance, future governance, and social consensus dictate.\n\nFrom Osmosis, the BSP can expect:\nDefault Asset List – the Ethereum assets bridged by the selected provider will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone default asset list – i.e. their bridged ETH and ERC-20 assets will be ETH, USDC, etc., all other bridges' assets would be bridge1ETH, bridge2USDC, and the like. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions. In the near future, we expect custom token lists to become the norm in Cosmos, as they are on Ethereum, so that users can search for and import tokens that they want to interact with.\nOsmosis Incentives – the DAO commits to prioritizing the assets of the canonical bridge, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools–under the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.\nIntegration – Osmosis expects to work closely with the BSP. At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).\n\nFrom the BSP, Osmosis can expect:\nIntegration / Availability – the BSP will help optimize integrations in a timely manner in accordance with Osmosis’ stated goals of achieving deposits and withdrawals from the app.osmosis.zone UI and Keplr Wallet (without pass-through to the bridge UI).\nLiquidity Mining Incentives – if a project’s proposal included the promise of incentives (e.g. Axelar, at least 1% of Axelar tokens to be used for incentives on Osmosis).\n\nRevocability / At-will / Permissionless: As noted, these expectations are preliminary and subject to change as the DAO, developers, and the bridge team see fit. Osmosis DAO and the BSP will be working with each other for their mutual benefit, without contractual promise or obligation. It will be up to the BSP team to maintain a good relationship with Osmosis Labs regarding the front-end implementation details. Osmosis DAO empowers Osmosis Labs to change BSPs if in their estimation, the relationship has become unworkable, or the technical landscape suggests a superior solution, subject to ratification by the DAO.\nShould the arrangement become unworkable for either party for whatever reason, the arrangement can be changed or terminated without notice. Any damages for bad behavior (broken promises, bridge failures) will be to reputation alone. Specific promises between the BSP and an individual user (e.g. bridge insurance) are not covered by this disclaimer, nor are potential future agreements between the DAO and various developers, teams, or individuals.\n\nFurther details and discussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4482-osmosis-canonical-ethereum-bridge-proposals",0.0025547783854853825],["Adopt Axelar as the Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider\n\nVoting YES to this proposal means that you want Axelar to be adopted as the Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider. \n\nThis vote follows the rules set in Proposal 205 for this special approval voting process. \nThat vote also set the preliminary expectations for the working relationship between the canonical bridge service provider and Osmosis. \nFor further context see: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4482-osmosis-canonical-ethereum-bridge-proposals\n\nApproval voting procedures summary: \nOnly YES votes will be counted.

This causes some direct trades between ATOM/X to have a lower, or identical cost in swap fee to the multi-hop routes. As trades via OSMO pools usually benefit from their higher liquidity and so have lower slippage costs in comparison to non-OSMO pools they may still be the more optimal route for larger trades. The use of OSMO pools as the optimal trade route for user purchases is beneficial for Osmosis.\n Ideally this would be voted on purely by Pool 1 Liquidity Providers, however pool sub-governance is not functional yet and so this will be asked of all Osmosis governance and implemented during the next software upgrade if passed. \n Pool 1 Liquidity Providers specifically should see compensatory swap fees generated from the new routes passing through the pool as well as increased frequency of volatility harvesting as mentioned in the multihop proposal.\n\n Affected routes:\n From Identical swap fees to Multihop being having lower swap fees: ATOM/JUNO, ATOM/STARS, ATOM/CMDX, ATOM/LUM, ATOM/NGM, ATOM/IOV\n From higher swap fees in Multihop to Identical swap fees: ATOM/IXO, ATOM/DEC, ATOM/CHEQ\n\n For a full comparison of the swap fees by route before and after the change proposed see here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFI4S5wqDoC-WiUbWoLJ0dRbylqbvQ1ZTjpiN71lkGA\n\nFurther details and discussion: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4340-reduce-osmoatom-pool-swap-fee-to-02",0.011546120242698299],["Signalling Proposal for AssetMantle Incentivised pool\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/MNTL (#690) pool on Osmosis.\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/MNTL (#690) pool on Osmosis.\n\nDetails\nThis is a signalling proposal to include the OSMO/MNTL (#690) pool into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives.

After this proposal has passed governance, this pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.\n\nAbout USDC\nUSD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars, backed by dollar denominated assets held in segregated accounts with US regulated financial institutions.\n Since its launch in 2018, USDC has become powerful market infrastructure for applications and businesses of all sizes in nearly every industry. USDC flows seamlessly across many of the world’s leading blockchains and is widely used throughout this transformative internet layer.\n Website: https://www.circle.com/en/usdc\n\nFurther details and discussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4634-signalling-proposal-for-incentivized-canonical-usdc-pool",0.012794203446487407],["Make Osmosis the Co-Lead Sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022\n\nSummary:\n\nIf this signaling proposal passes, the funding provided by Osmosis proposal #110 will be used to make the Osmosis community the co-lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022.\n\nDescription:\n\nCosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world and raise more awareness of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. This year’s Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia - on September 27 & 28.\nJust as last year, Cosmoverse will keep a strong community spirit. We aim to bring the Cosmos community together in one room with core Cosmos builders. The community will be able to ask questions, listen to keynote speeches, and talk to Cosmos core developers face to face. This also gives Cosmos projects the opportunity to strengthen their relationship with the community.\n\nWhy should the funds from prop #110 be used for sponsorship?\n\nProp #110 was submitted by NosNodes (https://twitter.com/NosNodes) with the purpose to incentivize more community building by the Cosmoverse team. Thank you, NosNodes! <3\n\nAfter Prop #110 passed, the Cosmoverse team received 20,000 OSMO in funding. We are extremely grateful for that. \nWe were able to use the funds to organize meetups (like the Denver Meetup: https://twitter.com/CosmoverseHQ/status/1495248152865042434?s=20&t=MZgUGjZuO6tkZBDB5Jmnqw), pay the initial deposit for the Medellin conference and cover travel expenses. \nWithout Osmosis, Cosmoverse would never have become what it is today.\n\nHow does it benefit the Osmosis community?\n\nThe funds from Osmosis prop #110 will make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.\n\n- Keynote speech: We offer two keynote slots to the Osmosis core team. Speakers TBA on our official Twitter account.\n- Booth in networking area: We offer Osmosis a prominent booth stand in the main networking area.\n- Logo placement: The Osmosis logo will be shown as “co-lead sponsor at the conference.\n- General Admission Tickets: We will give 10 general admission tickets to the Osmosis core team or the Osmosis community. Distribution TBD.\n- Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.\n- Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website\n\nYou decide:\n\n- By voting “Yes” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.\n- By voting “No” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should not be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.\n- “No with Veto” punishes the Cosmoverse team for this proposal\n- Vote “Abstain” if you do not have an opinion",0.027430952943938713],[" Match PSTAKE External Incentives for Pools #648\n\n**Proposal Details**\nMatch external incentives provided by the PSTAKE team for PSTAKE/OSMO (pool #648), the external incentives will continue for 90 epochs for 14 days bonding period. \n- By voting YES on this proposal, external PSTAKE incentives will be matched at ~$2,222 per day\n- By voting NO on this proposal, external PSTAKE incentives will NOT be matched at ~$2,222 per day\n\n**Context**\nThe PSTAKE team has allocated 500,000 PSTAKE across PSTAKE/OSMO pool 648 that amounts to ~$200,000 over the course of 90 epochs (Started on 07-05-2022)\nThe PSTAKE incentives are as follows:\n- PSTAKE/OSMO (Pool #648): ~5555 PSTAKE per day amounting to ~$2,222.\nTherefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$2,222 per day.\n \n**About [pSTAKE](https://pstake.finance/)** \npSTAKE, developed by Persistence, is a liquid staking solution that unlocks the potential of staked PoS assets (e.g. ATOM).

UST LP providers thought they were LP'ing with a stablecoin, and now they are facing significant further depeg risk. This proposal seeks to mitigate the IL loss due to the rapid depeg.\n \n UST pools have had unforeseen volatility and due to sigificant full depeg risk, Osmosis users should have a chance to avoid further potential impermanent loss. This proposal gives liquidity providers in these pools the option to take an action to unpool their liquidity in these UST pools if they wish. Unpooling would be a new message action an LP can take on these pools if they were bonded before the emergency proposal time. Unpooling on a 14 day bond will be the equivalent of exiting the pool, and then beginning a 14 day unlock for the constituent assets. This has the affect of confirming any impermanent loss, and will safeguard one half of their remaining liquidity tokens in the event of an asset in the pair going to zero.\n \n Furthermore, by reducing the liqudity between OSMO and UST, it makes the UST->OSMO->ATOM a less liquid exit liquidity path for UST, helping reduce OSMO price impact during further UST depegs.\n \n Governance should be very cautious with this, as its a significant change to Osmosis and may set a dangerous precedent. The change is concerning on multiple fronts, including the fairness to other LP's, using a hard fork for something thats arguably a market design problem, and what is to be expected in the next crash.\n \n Because this process requires a software upgrade and is extremely time sensitive, we propose adding the execution of this to the same mechanism proposed in proposal #225.  Namely, once 2/3 of *total chain voting power* approves proposal #225, if within a short time period, 2/3 of total chain voting power also approves this proposal, then this signals the approval for validators to include functionality enabling depooling in the emergency hard fork.\n \n The list of pools affected is:\n #560 (UST/OSMO)\n #562 (UST/LUNA)\n #567 (UST/EEUR)\n #578 (UST/XKI)\n #592 (UST/BTSG)\n #610 (UST/CMDX)\n #612 (UST/XPRT)\n #615 (UST/LUM)\n #642 (UST/UMEE)\n #679 (4Pool)\n \n Note: This Proposal will consider to be passed based on 67\\% of governance voting Yes and failed based on 33\\% voting No and so will be eligible for action when this threshold has passed rather than at the end of the voting period.",0.019711733882308995],["Remove Incentives from all Terra pools\n\nVoting YES for this proposal indicates that OSMO incentives should be removed from all Terra related pools and the fixed daily OSMO emissions reallocated to all other Incentivized pools. \n\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that OSMO incentives on Terra pools will remain, and incentives naturally drain over time. \n\n Background \n Due to the hyperinflation of LUNA supply caused by the recent UST depeg event, LUNA pools receive a far higher share of incentives than they should according to the current incentive model. \n UST incentives will likely also excessive once the hard fork allows unpooling and liquidity falls, as well as when the first people unbonding begin to sell their UST into the pool. \n As Osmosis incentives cannot be adjusted by more than 25% a week due to the Scaling Cap setting, the incentives on these pools may remain high for several months. This results in Osmosis paying for liquidity in these pools which is, at best, a highly speculative purchase based on any potential recovery model. At worst, users will buy in to obtain a high APR and be used as exit liquidity for people who have unbonded early. \n While the existing incentives do compensate for Impermanent Loss to some extent, they do not differentiate between users who suffered this and users who bought in since. If this proposal passes, liquidity providers will have obtained 11 days of incentives since the crash.\n The Osmosis emissions taken from the Terra pools will be distributed proportionately to all incentivised pools, giving all pools a boost of around a third of their APR\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4878-urgent-remove-all-terra-related-incentives",0.009745667565531116],["[Action Required] Signalling Proposal for Emergency v8 Upgrade at 4402000\n\nThis proposal is for coordination of the emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary as already approved in proposals 225 and 226. It is an emergency upgrade hard fork for adding the unpooling feature for UST pools (prop 226) and shifting OSMO incentives off of LUNA and UST related pools (prop 225, 222-224).\n\nThis change has been reviewed by a number of validators and experienced cosmos developers. It has had pretty thorough testing on a testnet given the time constraints.\n\nAddendums to unpooling not specified in 226\n\nUnpooling of locks that are superfluid staked will not have slashing risk to avoid the large amount of code complexity implementing this would create and the time it would take to get implement it securely.\n\nAdditionally, it seems to have been the intention of prop 226 to include all UST pools, even though some were not included in the prop 226 text. This seems to have been human error on the proposal creators part. Several validators have signalled being in favor of this through several chats.\n\nUpgrade information\n\nThis upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The v8.0.0 software version is fully state-compatible with v7.3.0 until the upgrade block 4402000, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v6 upgrade (prop 103), used when the IBC channel creation mechanism was broken.\nThe proposed upgrade block height of 4402000 is estimated to be at May 15, 2022, 16:00 UTC (Sunday).\nAll validators, and full node operators should update their software to version v8.0.0 prior to 14:00 UTC (Sunday). After doing so, validators should vote yes on this proposal signalling that they have upgraded.\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash – requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\n\nActionable(s)\nEvery node should upgrade their software version from v7.3.0 to v8.0.0 before the upgrade block height 4402000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at upgrades/v7/bin to be v8.0.0, and restart the node. Do check that cosmovisor version says 8.0.0.\nUpon upgrading their setup and processing a block, every validator should vote yes on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade.)\nEvery node should check in at May 15th 2PM (14:00) UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have voted yes on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didn’t upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of the validator voting power has not signalled readiness by 2PM (14:00) UTC, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should revert their binary back to v7.3.0 until further notice.\nFurthermore, please review the numbers for the accelerated incentives updates in https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/1481/files#diff-cafe8a3f5831b68ac650982d09609c545f5990c6a1e6602ea4fb5c9bc04aa3bb, and v8 logic.\n\nFailure case and risks involved\n\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start.

That we overhaul the meta process for generation of adjustment proposals. This has historically been implemented through a series of google spreadsheets implementing each variant of the mechanism, with static copies made for the generation of each proposal. This shall be replaced with a Github repository based process, which will make public tracking of changes easier, and allow for (nearly) full automation of the proposal generation process.\n\n2. That we modify the current mechanism (bias, subsidy, matching, fee cap, etc) to first group pools into categories, each with a parameterized incentive share, and then pools within each category split that share based on their share of fees collected and external incentives.\n\n\n## Github Repository\n\n[link to repo](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives/tree/unity/mainnet)\n\nThis Github repo will at all times contain at least 3 branches, which (along with some Github Action workflows), serve to automate the process of creating weekly adjustment proposals.\n\nThe `main` branch contains the process and data for the most recent proposal.\n\nThe `staging` branch contains the process for the next proposal.\n\nThroughout the week, PRs are made to `staging` corresponding to on chain text proposals, such as adding pools to onboarding, matching external incentives, or changing the adjustment process.\n\nA `liveview` branch off of staging is continually updated with new data, so that we can see what we expect the next proposal to look like.\n\nAs on chain text proposals pass, their PRs are merged to `staging` (and then merged to the `liveview` branch on the next update).\n\nWhen it is time for a new adjustment proposal, the `liveview` branch is merged back into `staging` (giving it up to date market data). And then `staging` branch is merged into `main`.\n\nThe data in the `main` branch is then used to create the on chain adjustment proposal.\n\n\n\n## Category Model\n\nThis model groups pools into a number of categories with proportional incentive shares, so that we can prioritize certain classes of liquidity directly.\n\n### Target Share\nThe share of incentives allocated to each category is then split according to the proportion of swap fees collected by each pool within the category. These values are limited by the `swap fee cap` (currently 3), such that pools will not benefit by having more than 3x the average fee APR of the category.\n\nWe then recalculate shares using (capped) fees + external incentives collected by the pool. To limit the incentive increase caused by a match relative to the base incentives, we take the minimum of this `adjusted reveneue` share, and `(1 + matched_multiple_cap) * capped_fee_share`. We set `matched_multiple_cap` at 1, so set matches to be no more than the base incentives of a pool.\n\n### Major\n\nQualification for `Major` status is determined by governance based on a combination of factors, namely:\n- Is the token market cap large relative to `Osmo`\n- Does the majority of the trade volume happen outside of Osmosis\n- Do we have a strategic interest in attracting more liquidity of this token\n\nThis proposal also entails choosing `ATOM`, `WETH`, `WBTC` and `CRO` as starting `Major` tokens. As well as `USDC`, `DAI`, and `EEUR` as stablecoins.\n\n### Minimum Share\nPools can also have a minimum share set by governance, to incentivize liquidity ahead of observed trading volume. We set minimums of 25% of incentives on pools 1 and 5% on pools 674, 704, and 712 as demonstration and to guarantee a large amount of incentives for base liquidity. These parameters would be set and changed by governance and should be used to prioritize the growth of strategic liquidity.\n### Categories\n\nThese initial category shares were chosen to approximately match the current breakdown of incentives between these groupings, but should be changed over time with follow up text proposals as needed.

Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.\n\n## Upgrade Features\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n\n### GAMM API changes\nAPI changes were done to enable more CFMM's to be implemented within the existing framework.\nIntegrators will have to update their messages and queries to adapt, please see https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/gamm/breaking_changes_notes.md\n\n### Governance Changes\n* Superfluid stakers now have their votes override their validator's votes\n* Governance can set a distinct voting period for every proposal type\n\n### IBC\n* Upgrade to IBC v3\n* Enable Interchain account host module\n* See [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/app/upgrades/v9/upgrades.go#L49-L71) for the supported messages\n\n### Txfees\n* Non-osmo txfees now get swapped into osmo every day at epoch, and then distributed to stakers.\n\n### Cosmwasm\n* Upgrade from wasmd v0.23.x to v0.27.0. This has the following features:\n  * State sync now works for cosmwasm state\n  * Cosmwasm builds on M1 macs\n  * Many security fixes\n\n* The TokenFactory module is added to the chain, making it possible for users and contracts to make new native tokens.\n    * Cosmwasm bindings have been added, to make swapping and creating these new tokens easier within the contract ecosystem.\n\n\n## Getting Prepared for the Upgrade\nAs always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.\n\nIf using cosmovisor, either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v9/bin/.\n\nIf not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v9.0.0 binary.\n\n\n## Details of Upgrade Time\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be 4707300, anticipated to be on Tuesday June 7th 16:00 UTC. This uses an average block time of 6.3730 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.

We can’t count on other projects because such an experience doesn’t exist. Now, we can confidently state that the tax introduction, as expected, has led to significant drop in amount of chain transactions. The drop itself requires to take retaliatory measures.\n\nMotivation\nAt the moment, we can highlight just two main directions of on-chain transactions because of insufficiently branched blockchain infrastructure:\n\n1) Movements of funds from CEXs to cold wallets to provide security;\n2) Movements of funds from CEXs to the staking pool for profit-making purposes.\n\nFor most investors, the imposition of a 1.2% tax is enough reason to neglect security and keep funds in hot wallets of CEXs. Unfortunately we can’t help it. Another issue is staking conditions with which we can and should work.\n\nThe undelegation period in usual conditions (free from taxes) serves as a deterrent to keep a considerable amount of coins out of the market. In our case, the tax itself acts as a deterrent, but a long undelegation period prevents the inflow of a significant amount of funds from short-term investors into the staking pool from CEXs, and therefore, prevents efficient burning.\n\nUnderstanding the psychology of the market, we can suggest that during FOMO period, a significant amount of funds from casual and short-term investors will flow from hot wallets of CEXs into the staking pool. During panic sale period we will observe the reverse situation. This will result in an increase in volatility, but in the first and second cases we will get a massive surge in the volume of transactions and an increased amount of burned coins accordingly. In the future, the rate of burning itself will be a factor that reduces volatility and the system will be finally compensated.\n\nIn addition to this, the circulation of coins in the staking pool leads:\n\n1) Firstly, to an overall healthier on-chain;\n2) Secondly, to a more natural distribution of coins between validators;\n3) Finally, to a greater decentralization.\nAt the moment, this is as important as reducing the emission amount.\n\nI understand that the proposed solution is non-standard but the situation we are in is also non-standard. We will not be able to achieve a significant reduction in emissions without taking radical steps.\n\nProposal\nTo cancell or reduce the undelegation period as much as possible.\n\nAgora discussion: https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/cancellation-or-reduction-of-the-undelegation-period-in-order-to-speed-up-the-burning/47248",0.1546528943595571],["Massmedia fund\n\nLets make a fund to post news about Terra System and all around it to prevent fakes about Terra and a team of Terra System. ",0.17589322481813086],["Second Terra Phoenix Airdrop ✅\n\nTry The New Terra 2.0 version visiting https://v2Terra.pro",0.999612899415793],["Proposal to prevent any/all future minting of Luna Classic\n\nThe excessive and unnecessary minting of Luna Classic was the catalyst that rapidly led to its spiraling downfall.

This is no time for experiments, there is no room for experiments to this extreme.

That is to say, do we collectively wish for Osmosis to support the burn off-chain? What we are asking for from Osmosis: We are signaling to Osmosis that the LUNC community wishes for the burn to be implemented on the Osmosis DEX to both LUNC & USTC. To incentivize Osmosis to support the tax off-chain, we propose that the following burn-revenue share structure: 90% of the collected tax is to be sent back to Terra and into the burn wallet (terra1sk06e3dyexuq4shw77y3dsv480xv42mq73anxu), the remaining 10% shall be sent to the Osmosis Community Pool or a smart contract solely controlled by their governance mechanism. The 10% allocated to the Osmosis Community Pool shall be both the payment for ensuring that the tax is faithfully collected on an ongoing on Osmosis. How this can be accomplished: The creation of a coin/token agnostic & governance controlled burn module that allows for Osmosis DEX to place a % base premium on any coin/token on their DEX, via governance vote. The premium can be placed to the front and back end of swaps on their DEX in order to avoid de-stabilizing their uniquely hard coded liquidity pool structures. The coins collected would then be sent to an Osmosis smart contract that will then send the coins to back to Terra and into the burn wallet and also into the Osmosis Community Pool at 90% to 10% basis as discussed above. Prior to the crash, Terra and Osmosis enjoyed a deep relationship, with Osmosis being Terra’s primary non-CEX, off-chain source of liquidity, which allowed LUNA holders to access deep liquidity pools and sophisticated yield farming strategies. In turn, LUNA provided the Osmosis liquidity providers with a rich stream of swap fees. Our devs were friends and co-mingled. Now that LUNC is emerging from the shadows of the crash, we are once again on the cusp of reigniting our relationship with Osmosis and our devs are now once again forging friendships with one another, coming together as part of a greater collective ecosystem. LUNC Community, we must be willing to work with our counterparts within the greater Cosmos ecosystem to ensure that the tax is supported on as many off-chain platforms as can be reasonably accomplished. Join me in signaling to Osmosis that we wish for them to implement our tax on their own native DEX.

A list of Binance owned wallets has been provided to the community via the above announcement. It was confirmed with Binance that movement to and from Binance wallets will still be taxed. This means deposits and withdrawals are not exempt, but rather only the internal movements between wallets will be exempt for their internal security purposes. This first governance proposal is seeking consensus around this request from Binance. The implementation of this whitelist feature will be parameterized, with the initial list set to the provided Binance list. Thus, if this feature is accepted to be adopted, future changes to this whitelist can be controlled by the community in a governance parameter change proposal.

That is to say, do we collectively wish for Osmosis to support the burn off-chain? What we are asking for from Osmosis: We are signaling to Osmosis that the LUNC community wishes for the burn to be implemented on the Osmosis DEX to both LUNC & USTC. To incentivize Osmosis to support the tax off-chain, we propose that the following burn-revenue share structure: 90% of the collected tax is to be sent back to Terra and into the burn wallet (terra1sk06e3dyexuq4shw77y3dsv480xv42mq73anxu), the remaining 10% shall be sent to the Osmosis Community Pool or a smart contract solely controlled by their governance mechanism. The 10% allocated to the Osmosis Community Pool shall be both the payment for ensuring that the tax is faithfully collected on an ongoing on Osmosis. How this can be accomplished: The creation of a coin/token agnostic & governance controlled burn module that allows for Osmosis DEX to place a % base premium on any coin/token on their DEX, via governance vote. The premium can be placed to the front and back end of swaps on their DEX in order to avoid de-stabilizing their uniquely hard coded liquidity pool structures. The coins collected would then be sent to an Osmosis smart contract that will then send the coins to back to Terra and into the burn wallet and also into the Osmosis Community Pool at 90% to 10% basis as discussed above. Prior to the crash, Terra and Osmosis enjoyed a deep relationship, with Osmosis being Terra’s primary non-CEX, off-chain source of liquidity, which allowed LUNA holders to access deep liquidity pools and sophisticated yield farming strategies. In turn, LUNA provided the Osmosis liquidity providers with a rich stream of swap fees. Our devs were friends and co-mingled. Now that LUNC is emerging from the shadows of the crash, we are once again on the cusp of reigniting our relationship with Osmosis and our devs are now once again forging friendships with one another, coming together as part of a greater collective ecosystem. LUNC Community, we must be willing to work with our counterparts within the greater Cosmos ecosystem to ensure that the tax is supported on as many off-chain platforms as can be reasonably accomplished. Join me in signaling to Osmosis that we wish for them to implement our tax on their own native DEX.

It should be noted that only compute budget would be allocated for this item.\n\nThe link to the agora discussion can be found here:\nhttps://classic-agora.terra.money/t/ustc-test-environment/52031",0.016786900368086204],["Upgrade to v2.1.0\n\nThis proposal seeks community and validator agreement for the v2.1.0 software upgrade which was previously prepared by the L1 Task Force on the classic-terrra repo at https://github.com/classic-terra/core .

After the de-peg event in May, the Terra Classic repo was created, https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core 26, but not actively maintained. Thus, any code changes by active developers in the ecosystem were subject to the approval of a centralized entity, whose focus had shifted to a different blockchain project. Until August 2022, the terra-money repository was still the authoritative repository.\n\nGiven that TFL was no longer actively working on the classic chain, community governance passed proposal 4940 and elected to change the canonical repository to the Terra Rebel’s classic repository, https://github.com/terra-rebels/classic-core 26. This repo was then archived and switched to https://github.com/terra-rebels/classic 11 due to an exploit found in the IBC code, known as Dragonberry.\n\nHowever, at this time, we are facing a similar situation where a group of Terra Classic L1 developers are working on the blockchain, yet do not have write access to the current canonical repository, and are subject to the approval of a centralized entity. Given the decentralized nature of our blockchain, we are proposing that there be no canonical repository for Terra Classic. Thus, there is no one centralized entity or developer group that has default control over the code base. Guardianship of what code runs on the blockchain is solely in the hands of the active validator set.\nIn summary, we believe that this proposal offers two major benefits to the community.

Post concurrence from 7 out of 9 Multisig's on the effort estimates and based on community feedback, Signers will start working on the project\n9. Signers should provide periodic updates in stages to the community members.\n10. If there are any advance payment required, Signers after getting concurrence from TGF should initiate proposal for advance part payment.\n11. At the end of project, signers to submit the efforts made, time spent, expense / cost to TGF and post TGF review, it is initiated for governance voting.\n12.

It is a name forced onto the project when Luna 2.0 was created in an effort to try and take the interest from the original coin to the new.\n\nClearly the coin is no longer a meme coin and with all the changes being made to the blockchain. I think a rebranding reflecting the evolving project is a change that will have maximum impact on social media and will be picked up by all. Many of the changes made so far although much bigger in scale and undertaking are behind the scenes changes and are not always evident to a retail investor. It is a natural progression for the project to push away from its branding of Classic and show the world that it is constantly moving forward.\n\nWhilst I realise that a name change is a relatively minor change, it will not solve all our problems, but it will be a big talking point and will cement home we have taken the destiny of the coin into our own hands as a community and removed the shackles of classic that was forced upon the project.\n\nLuna One (ticker LUNO) has so many pertinent meanings, the rise back to \"one dollar\" it was the first coin it sounds more modern.

This revenue will belong to the protocol and the amount used to refill the pools and/or burn the LUNC supply will be decided with Param Change Proposals via governance.\n\nThe oracle pool contains currently ~280B LUNC tokens ~1B USTC (around 65M$ in total).

These coins will remain the property of the protocol at all times. They never leave the protocol.\n\nThis is a UNISWAP v3 DEX (concentrated liquidity feature) implemented as a cosmos core module listing LUNC/USTC.

The v2.0.0 upgrade is a major blockchain upgrade containing upgrades to Cosmos SDK v0.45.13 and Tendermint v34.24\nGiven a successful first quarter, it is proposed that the L1 Task Force receives a Q2 mandate to continue development on the blockchain. In Q2 the L1 Task Force will focus on extensive testing for the v2.0.0 upgrade and building out the testnet, providing technical advice/development support for 'Ziggy' and deploy v2.1.0, brining the blockchain to parity with other cosmos blockchains. In addition, the L1 Task Force will seek to work with an L2 team* to develop ‘Classic Station’ and provide high-demand features such as on-ramp capability. The main benefit of maintaining an up-to-date forked version of Station includes streamlining the testing and upgrade scheduling process while reducing the burden on other 3rd party organizations.\n\nThe L1 Task Force team members for Q2 are intended to remain the same as they were from February to end of March in Q1, with the exception of Edward Kim who will be making a lateral move to work on AI sidechain development and features for the Luna Classic blockchain.

Some argued that the very premise of a partially-collateralized decentralized stable coin was a pipe dream and [the depegging event was simply evidence of that fact.](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/dark-moon-the-inevitable-collapse-of-luna/)\n\nHowever, with the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank and its relationship with USDC, I think we all now realize the value of having a truly decentralized stable coin, and I believe USTC can still keep that promise.\n\n**Let’s make USTC useful again.**\n\nWhy should LUNC holders care about USTC? Because without USTC, there is nothing to distinguish LUNC from any other meme coin. \n\nOr to put in terms that meme holders will understand: **without restoring the burn mechanism, LUNC will NEVER give you LAMBO.** :sob:\n\nFirst of all, I want to acknowledge upfront that any revitalization plan requires trade offs. I think there was a lot of magical thinking around re-pegging UST to $1 which immediately followed the collapse that has hopefully subsided by now.\n\nHere are the constraints that my plan attempts to satisfy:\n\n1. NO NEW COINS (only pure LUNC/USTC)\n2. Minimal development efforts\n3. Restore USTC as a useful medium for transactions\n4. Provide long-term value for current USTC holders\n5. Burn LUNC :fire: :fire: :fire:\n6. Incentivize/reward LUNC stakers\n7. Restore the original mint/burn mechanism that resulted in the largest decentralized stable coin in history\n\n**Okay so what's the plan?**\n\nThe plan has two parts:\n\n1. Reactivate the mint/burn mechanism and set peg for USTC at 1/100 to the dollar or $0.01\n2. Create a wallet funded by a LUNC/USTC transaction tax which entitles any Terra Classic wallet holding USTC at the time of the mint/burn reactivation to a perpetual dividend in proportion to their holdings.\n\n**Why is this a good idea?**\n\nThere is a fundamental tension which exists between the interests of current USTC holders and current LUNC holders. This tension is destroying the chain’s ability to recover. LUNC holders must offer USTC holders some long-term incentive to realize a 99% haircut on their holdings.\n\nThis new USTC dividend wallet should grow more valuable as the chain grows and transaction volume increases. This gives USTC holders an incentive to support this proposal and be willing to take the haircut.\n\nPart of the magical thinking I referenced above is the idea that USTC in its current form can regain the $1 peg. Unfortunately, this is not realistic as there is no way to reasonably cover its over $10 billion in outstanding liability.\n\nFurthermore, LUNC holders will benefit because my plan ensures the USTC pegging to $0.01 will **burn** :fire: :fire: :fire: LUNC, *not mint.*\n\n**How does that burn guarantee work?**\n\nOnce the plan is adopted, USTC is sure to immediately nosedive to close to the proposed new peg price of $0.01. There needs to be a mechanism in place to prevent USTC falling below $0.01 and starting a new unholy death spiral between LUNC and USTC.\n\nTwo important mechanisms should ensure this doesn’t happen. Firstly. Maintaining USTC’s peg at $0.01 reduces USTC’s outstanding liability to a much more manageable ~$110 million. Secondly, the fund for USTC holders at the time of the re-activation of the burn/mint mechanism should ensure that USTC still trades at a premium prior to reactivation.\n\n**(Value of USTC at re-activation) = $0.01 + estimated value of future wallet fund dividends**\n\nOnce that value is locked in, USTC and LUNC can resume its once powerful relationship and bring utility back to the chain.\n\nHopefully this will set us on a much more sustainable path for future growth and reward both current LUNC and USTC holders in the process.\n\nOn a personal note, I lost a ton of money when UST depegged and still had faith in the networks ability to recover. This was magical thinking. \n\nA year later, I would be willing to realize that haircut if it meant the overall network health could recover, and I was offered some personal financial stake in the recovery of the network.\n\nI would love nothing more than to see beloved dApps like Anchor, Kujira, Stader, etc. return to the chain, and all they have to do is update their USTC related pricing.",0.6386471951190983],["Do kwon get out tera\n\nhe is a fool.  tera can't grow without him",0.16666666666666666],["remove companies and exchanges that have more than 0.5 in luna community voting decisions\n\nremoved the vote validation and voting power.  to the company and exchange which have more than 0.5% sales force and leave the luna community.  because look who are the companies that vote against the luna community.  you vote you won",0.1666595238414724],["Proposal to make Luna Classic ($LUNC) a GAS token on Terra ($LUNA)\n\nTerra was a dual-token network, and it should remain one.

Much of her experience has been shared through her Youtube Channel, Just Crypto, as well as on Twitter. She is also proficient in the crucial crypto skill of meme making.  \n\n## Personal Statement\n\nCrypto is important because it allows for true ownership, transactions without a trusted intermediary, anonymity, transparent verification, equal access, freedom from government control and sound, predictable money. We're on the cusp of creating a new financial system that is more fair, more accessible. Yet we are beset on every side with centralized ponzi schemes, cash grabs disguised as businesses and DeFi reliant on inflationary tokenomics to survive. A decentralized economy needs decentralized money. It also needs to grow up. Kujira brings grown up DeFi and grown up governance to the Web3 economy. The Kujira team has shown resilience through the greatest of storms and is building at a rapid pace with a best in class user experience.

I also worked for a conference company for 5+ years and would converse with companies to bring them to events at varying rates on various packages depending on their needs (group attendance, sponsorship etc). I would also assist startups in arranging meetings with Private Investors and Family Offices. I have also been a part of Kujira since pre-IDO.

After one month of reviewing proposals for recommended options, the community should make a decision on the direction of the ProtoRev account.\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to provide a recommendation around how Osmosis should initially handle the revenue generated by the ProtoRev module.\n\nOnce the ProtoRev module is implemented as part of the v15 upgrade, the community will need to decide how this revenue should be allocated. We recommend that Osmosis wait a minimum of 4 months and let the revenue accrue to a dedicated account controlled by governance. While it should be deployed to the benefit of Osmosis in the future, the community should wait until it has accumulated enough capital to make a material impact whenever it is deployed.\n\n# Background\n\n## ProtoRev Module Design Overview\n\nAs described in the governance forum post about the ProtoRev module, the module will check a set of possible arbitrage routes after every transaction and determine whether a back-running arbitrage opportunity was created by the transaction. The module will then:\n* Determine the most profitable arbitrage opportunity and optimal trade size\n* Leverage the Bank module to flash-loan itself the tokens required to perform the arbitrage trade\n* Conduct the swaps for guaranteed profit\n* Repay the loan by burning the flash-loaned assets\n\nThese transactions will take place after standard user transactions at the end of the block to rebalance the pools and capture the arbitrage profits. The revenue captured by the ProtoRev module will accrue to an account controlled by Osmosis governance. The ProtoRev module will conduct OSMO and ATOM settled arbs initially, so this account will hold a mix of OSMO and ATOM.\n\n## Benefits for Osmosis\n\nThe ProtoRev module is a groundbreaking innovation for AMMs and stands to improve the economic sustainability and UX for Osmosis:\n\n**Economic Sustainability**\nThe ability to capture in-protocol MEV as protocol revenue is one of the largest competitive advantages that Osmosis has over DEX’s built on monolithic chains. These other AMM applications are limited to rent-seeking forms of revenue generation (e.g. Uniswap’s fee switch) because all MEV accrues directly to validators. That’s not to say that Osmosis should not implement a take rate on trading fees, but rather that it’s unlikely to be sustainable as the only form of protocol revenue.\n\nWe have already begun to see compression of DEX fees as evidenced by the introduction of Uniswap’s 5bps and 1bp fee tiers. We have also seen this dynamic play out with traditional exchanges, as Robinhood was able to capture huge amounts of market share from incumbents (e.g. Fidelity, Schwab) by removing trading fees. As more DEXs enter the Cosmos ecosystem, the ability to undercut fees will serve as a strong competitor differentiator for Osmosis. By allowing Osmosis to capture a more sustainable revenue stream in the form of benign MEV, the ProtoRev module greatly improves Osmosis’s positioning as the space becomes more competitive.\n\n**Protocol Health**\nIn addition to capturing protocol revenue that would otherwise be lost to searchers, the ProtoRev module will also improve the UX of Osmosis. Current arbitrage systems run intermittently, allowing price differentials to remain in place for multiple blocks. The ProtoRev module will keep asset prices even across pools for every trade by running cyclical arbitrage at the end of each block to rebalance the pools.\n\n# Revenue Projections\n\nFrom October 1 to December 31st, there has been $176,637.97 extracted from Osmosis liquidity pools in the form of arbitrage transactions. This translates to approximately $1,941 per day. [(Source)](https://satellite.skip.money/)\n\nAs can be seen from the below charts from this period, this extraction varies hugely depending on the market conditions which trigger these transactions during periods of high volatility.\n$30,737 (17.6%) of this MEV was extracted over the two days of October 27th, 2022 to October 28th 2022 (Binance Listing)\n\nThe FTX collapse caused significantly higher volatility and so higher MEV extraction during the second week of November 2022.\n\nDecember 10th 2022 has a spike in price caused by manipulation on Binance due to closed withdrawals/deposits. [(Source)](https://t.ly/llXI)\n\n[USD Captured as MEV on Osmosis 3rd October 2022 - 31st December 2022](https://t.ly/HWk1)\n\n[Price and Volume chart of OSMO in the same period, showing alignment of volatile periods with increase in MEV.](https://t.ly/cvGZ)\n\nDuring a stable bear market, excluding these spikes, we may expect MEV to reach $1,368 per day, of which an estimated 70-80% will be recovered by the ProtoRev module.\n\nFor comparison purposes, during the last bull market, for February 1st 2022 - April 31st 2021, cumulative MEV collected was $1,821,199, or $20,462 per day. This shows that the potential return from the ProtoRev module in arbitrage alone may be a significant part of protocol income in the future. Especially with the addition of links to many more chains since this period than existed on Osmosis at the time, allowing for more opportunities for arbitrage between routes to occur.\n\n# Recommendation\n\nAs the bear market rages on, we want to ensure the MEV revenue generated by the ProtoRev module is utilized in a manner which maximizes its benefits to the Osmosis community. The Osmosis Community Pool at the time of this writing currently holds 63.22M OSMO tokens. This is expected to grow at an accelerated rate as we continue to shift incentives which were previously allocated to incentivizing liquidity pools.\n\nTo this end, MEV revenue should be deployed at times when the contributions can be meaningful in size to the protocol. As discussed, on average we may expect MEV to reach ~$1300 per day which we can expect the ProtoRev module to recover the majority of.\n\nAlthough this creates a positive value accrual mechanism for the Osmosis community, the amounts being generated would not be significant if added to the community pool which currently is receiving 60% of the liquidity incentives. Allowing this revenue to be directed to the community pool would fail to maximize the benefits to the traders, liquidity providers and stakers of Osmosis.\n\nIn the current market conditions, directing this revenue to stakers would not move the needle in terms of value accrual to OSMO. By our estimates, stakers would only see a 0.8% increase in staking yield (e.g. 23.28% to 23.46%) if they were to receive 100% of the ProtoRev module’s revenue. Since Skip will receive 20% of the revenue in Year 1 (as part of the [community approved payment schedule](https://t.ly/EG3f), stakers would only see 0.14% added to their APR. While the community should consider this option in the future as the emission schedule winds down, or if MEV revenue increases, there are likely more impactful ways to deploy this capital in the near term.\n\nAs such, we are proposing the revenue generated from MEV is collected, until the funds can grow to have a meaningful impact towards benefiting the community. We believe it is in the best interest of the community to collect the revenue in an account controlled by governance. Over the next four months, community members should submit proposals with their recommendation on how best to deploy these funds. The community can then vote on the potential options to distribute this revenue. We recommend that the community should conduct reviews on a quarterly basis to evaluate the ongoing impact of deployed capital. Based on the results, adjustments can be made as needed to ensure this protocol income is utilized effectively and proportionately.\n\nBelow are some ideas on how we could deploy MEV revenue in the future:\n\n**UX Benefits**\n* Subsidization of swap fees, gas fees, or bridge / on-ramping fees\n\n**Supplementing / Replacing Costs**\n* Supplement LP yield for high priority (e.g. Superfluid Staking) or under-incentivised pools\n* Supplement staking yield\n\n**Other**\n* Funding growth initiatives or loyalty programs\n* Insurance pool\n* Building a stablecoin reserve\n\n# Conclusion\nThis proposal would allow the revenue captured by the ProtoRev module to accumulate within a module address. This will allow the community to assess the amount of typical value captured by the module as well as forming a reserve of capital. Accumulating a larger reserve will enable this capital to have a more meaningful impact when it is ultimately deployed.\n\nThis Revenue Reserve would be assessed no earlier than 1st June 2023. After reviewing proposals for recommended options, the community should make a decision on the direction of the ProtoRev account.\n\n# Additional Note\nWhile all options should be evaluated during the research phase, we believe that the community pool or DAOs with authorised spends are likely more appropriate sources of funding for any use case that would involve discrete, one-off spend. Unlike the community pool, the ProtoRev account address does not need consent from governance for each deployment of assets to every contract authorised by governance to be able to draw on funding. This enables more flexibility to create an approach that optimizes the streaming of funds to maximize impact.

These cause Liquidity Providers to pay a fee when withdrawing from the pool. Users withdraw their tokens, minus a proportion of the LP shares, for the exit fee. These LP shares are burned, resulting in pro-rata distribution to remaining LPs.\n\nAs a method of retaining liquidity their usefulness is questionable. A liquidity provider who wishes to leave the pool will likely regard a small 0.1% fee as negligible compared to their reasoning for leaving, such as migration to another pool or confirming their current ratio of assets.\n\nA larger fee may be better at retaining liquidity, however, these begin to prevent users from leaving the pool without sacrificing earned rewards and therefore increase the hurdle for users to overcome the sunk cost fallacy on declining pools.\n\nCurrently there is no display of the exit fee on the [Osmosis.zone](http://Osmosis.zone) frontend and so a user may not be aware of this fee when joining a pool, therefore being unable to estimate the time they must provide liquidity for before their returns outweigh the exit fee. If this proposal is rejected then this should be added to make users aware of potential exit fees on pools.\n\nVery few pools have utilised exit fees during the lifetime of Osmosis, the majority of which are abandoned. All pools currently utilising Exit fees are listed below.\n\nThis proposal argues that the option to have exit fees is at best, obsolete, with other methods of liquidity stickiness such as the now default 14 day bonding time, and at worst harmful to the Osmosis liquidity provision experience. Accommodating this setting in frontend displays and integrations causes unnecessary complexity and so this setting should be removed during a future software upgrade.\n\nDuring removal, all pools with Exit Fee settings will have it removed and no future pools will be able to add one.\n\n## Affected pools\n553 - LIKE/OSMO\n596 - BOOT/ATOM\n555 - LIKE/ATOM\n905 - DYS/OSMO\n597 - BOOT/OSMO\n802 - ATOM/stATOM\n654 - CRBRUS/HUAHUA\n595 - BOOT/ATOM\n696 - GLX/OSMO\n551 - LIKE/OSMO\n552 - LIKE/ATOM\n554 - LIKE/ATOM\n652 - CRBRUS/OSMO\n655 - CRBRUS/HUAHUA\n657 - CRBRUS/HUAHUA\n797 - UMEE/HOPE\n\n[Including Liquidity and Exit Fee settings](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/4d2aac4a-1d35-487f-bca2-bc8d6ec994d7.1676301806551)\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9793-remove-exit-fee-option-from-pools](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9793-remove-exit-fee-option-from-pools)",0.015116022612391866],["Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match\n\n## Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match\n\n### Summary\nThis is a signaling proposal to re-include the IST pool OSMO/IST (#837) into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives.

After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST. IST liquidity will be incentivized through the Cosmos ecosystem, with Osmosis being a critical early destination.\nThe authors believe that it would be in the best interests of the community to incentivize an OSMO-IST pool to drive deep eventual liquidity and easy access from any other Osmosis token.\n\n### What is IST?\nIST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric’s unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric’s model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.\n\nFor its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST. Each PSM accepts another Cosmos stablecoin and mints IST in exchange. There are currently six PSM contracts running, accepting DAI, USDC and USDT over both Axelar and Gravity bridges, each with different minting limits. Rationale for the current minting limits was explained by the elected governance committee here: https://community.agoric.com/t/ist-minting-limits-for-inter-protocol-mvp-launch/87/1 \n\nAdditional PSMs may be added by governance to accept new IBC-accessible stablecoins. \nIST’s next iteration will include overcollateralized vaults, which will drive a major unlock for minting capability and allow the token to diversify away from bridge risk and stablecoin centralization risk.\n\nUser Docs: https://docs.inter.trade/ \n\nAnalytics: https://analytics.inter.trade/ \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/inter_protocol\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.com/invite/interprotocol\n",0.11908404534736998],["Signaling Proposal - Define New Stable Asset: IST and incentivize stable swap pool DAI / CMST / IST with OSMO rewards\n\n## Signaling Proposal - Define New Stable Asset: IST and incentivize stable swap pool DAI / CMST / IST with OSMO rewards\n\n## Part 1: Recognize IST as a Stable asset, a Stabletoken\nThis proposal would recognize IST as a Stabletoken asset on Osmosis.\n\n### Details\nStablecoins backed by fiat assets are under regulatory scrutiny.  There are stable assets that are still pegged to fiat currencies, but are backed by on-chain cryptocurrencies instead of off-chain regulated fiat assets.\nThroughout this proposal the distinction between the two are defined as:  \n\n**Stablecoin** - (1) A cryptocurrency designed to maintain parity with another asset, usually an off-chain asset or fiat currency, such as US Dollar.  (2) Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value, unlike most other cryptocurrencies which are known for their volatility. This is achieved by pegging the value of the stablecoin to a stable asset, such as the US dollar. This makes stablecoins useful for transactions and payments, as they provide the benefits of cryptocurrencies (such as fast, secure, and borderless transactions) without the volatility that can make other cryptocurrencies difficult to use as a reliable store of value.\n\n**Stabletoken** - A class of stablecoins that are backed with primarily on-chain cryptocurrency assets rather than off-chain assets.\n\nThe use of Stabletoken is encouraged to differentiate between stable currencies that are backed by off-chain regulated  assets vs on-chain assets.\n\nProposal 233 defined Stablecoins (and therefore the class Stabletokens)  as an asset type to be used in the incentive category structure. Assets defined as Stablecoins/Stabletokens are currently eligible for:\n\nAccess to the Osmo/Stable Category for their incentivized pools\nAccess to the Stable/Stable Category for their incentivized pools\nAutomatic matching of External incentives within the Stable/Stable Category as per Proposal 377 \n\nPart 1 of this proposal established IST as a Stablecoin/Stabletoken asset on Osmosis.\n\n### Voting\n* By voting YES on this proposal, IST will be recognized on Osmosis as a Stabletoken.\n* By voting NO on this proposal, IST's status will remain unchanged\n\n**About IST**  \nIST is currently the largest native Cosmos circulating Stabletoken with over $1.8M minted.\nIt is currently mintable via the Inter Protocol parity stability module from USDC, USDT or DAI and will be mintable later this year from volatile assets, such as ATOM.  Exchanges that list IST include Crescent and Osmosis with more coming online every monthly.  As a native Cosmos Stabletoken, it is not a bridged asset and once minted on the Agoric chain, can be used by any and all of the IBC zones.\n\nWebsite: https://inter.trade/\n\n## Part 2: Enable OSMO incentive for core StableSwap pool DAI / CMST / IST\nPart 2 of this proposal recognzes the StableSwap 3 pool of DAI / CMST / IST as a core StableSwap pool and enables OSMO incentives at the next routine incentives proposal.\nThis is a signaling proposal to include the StableSwap 4 pool DAI / CMST / IST into the set of pools that receive OSMO liquidity incentives by recognising it as a core StableSwap pool.\nAfter this proposal has passed governance, the pool will be added to the regular incentives program of OSMO and receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool. \nThe pool incentivised at this time would be Pool 908 with IST & CMST being native Cosmos stable tokens and DAI & USDC provided via the Axelar bridge and as such are the canonical representations of these on Osmosis according to Proposal 206. \nIf the canonical status of one of these assets is changed then incentives would move at the next routine proposal to the pool containing the new canonical assets, with the highest volume and matching the criteria stated in Proposal 377.\nStable pools are incentivised by the model defined in Proposal 377.

Summary\n\nBabylon proposes a 3-phase integration to allow Osmosis to leverage the security  of the Bitcoin network and enjoy benefits such as fast stake unbonding and extra security for high-valued transactions. This signaling proposal serves a dual purpose: it not only signals the Osmosis community's intent to integrate phase 1 shortly after Babylon mainnet, but also provides a clear roadmap for the integration process. Phases 2 and 3 will be specified and voted for by the community in future governance proposals.\n\nCommonWealth forum post: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9967-babylon-integration-proposal-with-osmosis\n\nWe have created an FAQ based on the feedback we received from the community which can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1NmMZZTtWPJRWJXwPtAWIykAPDmPaZx4OgyL8fS2ik/edit?usp=sharing\n\n1. Overview\n\nThe Babylon project allows PoS chains to leverage Bitcoin security. Babylon uses Bitcoin to timestamp critical PoS consensus data (such as headers with quorum certificate). This secure timestamping resolves a fundamental security threat to PoS chains that allows attackers to fork the chain without being slashed, known as the long-range attack.\nBut Babylon doesn’t just protect against long-range attacks. The same secure timestamping also improves the security dynamics for Cosmos PoS chains. To name a few: It allows for a shorter unbonding period without impacting the PoS chain’s security. It allows Osmosis clients to enjoy additional security for important high-valued transactions. It also allows for easier state sync and snapshot verification for node operators. It can also help with the IBC client initialization and verification, which is particularly important for Osmosis. \n\n2. Additional Context\n\nBabylon has conducted several events around Bitcoin security for Cosmos with Osmosis and Juno among others. There has been strong Cosmos community support for these efforts with 150+ people signing up for these events. Sunny from Osmosis has spoken at these events with great community receptivity from both the Babylon and Osmosis communities.\n3. Summary of the Three Phases of Integration\nBabylon proposes a 3-phase integration to allow Osmosis to leverage the security and availability of the Bitcoin network. At its core, Babylon verifies Osmosis’ critical consensus data (called checkpoints) submitted by IBC relayers and aggregates the checkpoints for secure Bitcoin timestamps.\nThe table below summarizes the integration phases. In particular, Phase-1 integration is permissionless, since it only involves a standard IBC connection without any code changes to Osmosis. Yet it can already unlock Bitcoin security for Osmosis. All the integrations will be thoroughly reviewed and tested on Osmosis testnet first. Separate governance proposals will be submitted for mainnet integrations.\n\nThree Phase Table\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF2xpu0reAbBHfNz4dult8DrPux-mnTZx3qP9SWQsug/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe Babylon integration will not impact the infrastructure and operations of Osmosis validators and relayers. It will provide extra information and tools that help them secure the network. \n\n\n4. More Details about the Integrations \n\nPhase-1: The Oracle\n\nIBC relayer’s client sync functionality will automatically submit Osmosis’ signed headers to Babylon. These headers will enter the Babylon ledger and be verified, and will receive secure BTC timestamps. Then any Babylon node can serve as an oracle for queries about:\nthe BTC-finalized Osmosis headers\nwhether there were long-range attacks to Osmosis\nThis information provides objective trusted heights and headers that allow Osmosis node operators (such as validators) and IBC relayer operators to bootstrap and verify Osmosis full nodes, light clients, and snapshots. It also allows Osmosis’ counterparty chains to verify their Osmosis IBC client.\nBelow is an example API call to a Babylon node for the query: \n>> https://<ip>:<port>/babylon/zoneconcierge/v1/finalized_chain_info/{chain_id} \nThe Babylon team will also maintain an API server and web service for better visualization and usability. For example, Babylon’s web service can display real-time updates of the partner chain’s latest information.\nThe Babylon team will also provide additional standalone tools to verify the correctness of any Babylon nodes. \nPhase-2: On-Chain Automation\nThe Babylon team will work with the community to design and develop an IBC application module that handles BTC timestamps and associated proofs sent by Babylon. Osmosis will import this module to its App struct. The module will work standalone and thus will not require changes to other codes, nor impact existing functionalities.\nCompared to Phase-1 where Osmosis users will need to access Babylon oracle nodes for Osmosis’ BTC timestamp information, this phase will enable the following on-chain automation:\nautomatically decide the latest headers finalized by BTC \nautomatically detect and alert any forking attacks on partner chain observed by Babylon\nThis phase will also be an enabler of Phase-3 integration, which utilizes the on-chain BTC timestamp information.\n\nOsmosis x Babylon Genesis swap\n\nIn order to foster a sense of cohesion and shared purpose between our communities, Babylon will be implementing a strategic initiative during Phase 2 of our project. As part of this initiative, we will be requesting token swap. These funds will be added to Babylon's community pool and will be utilized to support the growth and development of the Babylon partnership with Osmosis.\n\nKey components of this initiative will be the delegation and staking of the acquired OSMO and bootstrapping liquidity pools. This will not only help to secure the network and support the underlying blockchain, but will also provide a way for Osmosis to actively participate in the growth and success of Babylon. By ensuring that the genesis swap is being used to support both ecosystems, we believe that we can effectively promote alignment and a sense of shared ownership among our communities.\n\nOverall, this initiative is a crucial step towards building a strong and united partnership, and we are confident that it will play a key role in the long-term success of Babylon and integrations of bitcoin security on Osmosis. Details of the genesis swap will be included in a future prop (phase2).\n\nBABYLON/OSMO liquidity bootstrapping pool on Osmosis\nBabylon available on Osmosis\nAligned success for both communities \nDiversify both babylon and Osmosis community pool \n\nPhase-3: Unbonding Time Reduction \n\nThe Babylon team and Osmosis team will work together to hook Osmosis’ staking module with the IBC application module imported in Phase-2. The stake unbonding/undelegating request approval conditions will be updated to include the associated Osmosis block’s BTC finalization information provided by the IBC application module.\nThe BTC finalization time will be a configurable parameter. It enables a configurable stake unbonding time that can be as short as 15-30 hours, which is much shorter than the current 14 days.\n(The Babylon team is also researching other use cases of BTC security with the community.)\n5. Pro's of this Proposal\nBetter security for Osmosis \nOsmosis will become BTC secured with BTC-assisted node / light client bootstrapping and verification enabled, which is particularly useful for Osmosis validator and relayer operators\nOptionally, much shorter unbonding time (as short as 15-30 hours, and is configurable by Osmosis) may increase the number of Osmosis community members (especially OSMO stakers such as validators and delegators) because it gives them higher liquidity and can also significantly reduce the “idle” capital that does not earn yield due to the unbonding period.\nBabylon community will engage with Osmosis, increasing usage, community engagement and TVL\nMore institutional players may engage with Osmosis due to increased security of the chain through the Babylon integration increasing TVL\nThe integration will increase censorship resistance of Cosmos zones including Osmosis\n6. Cons of this Proposal\nHaving a steady stream of IBC transactions will somewhat increase the size of osmosis blocks. The additional size per Osmosis block will be in the order of the Osmosis header size.\nThere will be additional development and relaying commitment, but Babylon is partnered with Cosmos’ leading relayers.\n\n\nVoting\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers to show their intent for integrating phase 1 upon Babylon’s mainnet launch and signal support for the direction of Phase 2-3 integrations\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Phase 1 integration or do not support the direction of Phase 2-3 integration.\n\nBy voting ABSTAIN on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice no strong opinion on the matter.\n\nBy voting NOWITHVETO on this proposal, OSMO stakers contribute to a 1/3rd threshold that will cause this proposal to fail, and the deposit to be burned.\n",0.014989304601647121],["Osmosis Proposal Standards\n\nThis proposal intends to supersede [Proposal 199](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/199) by defining a set of standards for putting a proposal into voting period on Osmosis.\n\nProposals that have not met these criteria should be met with `NoWithVeto`.\n\n# Standards\nGovernance proposals must be posted as a draft on Commonwealth for at least three days before being submitted to chain to allow feedback.\n\n## CosmWasm Storecode Proposals\n*`wasm-store`, `migrate-contract`* \n\nCosmWasm StoreCode Proposals must contain the following information at minimum:\n* Git Commit ID or release\n* Version of Compiler used\n* A description of the code's purpose for a layman\n\nStoreCode Proposals must be posted with full text and links to the code to be deployed for a minimum of 7 days before being submitted to chain to allow deeper review.\n\n# Exemptions\n## Expedited Proposals\n*Proposals Utilising the `--expedited` flag implemented in V12* \n\nAny proposal utilising the Expedited status as defined in [Proposal 278](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/278) is exempt from this requirement.\nUse of this mechanism for non-urgent situations should be met with `NoWithVeto`.\nUrgent situations must be clearly communicated as such with a corresponding Commonwealth post.\n\n## Software and IBC Updates\n*Currently `software-upgrade`, `cancel-software-upgrade`, `ibc-upgrade`, `update-client` commands* \n\nSoftware and IBC updates are not required to be posted for review. \nThe coordination of Software Upgrade proposals is typically carried out in more direct channels between Developers and Validators and may be subject to sudden changes in scheduling. \nIBC Maintenance proposals are required when an IBC channel has become stale due to lack of use.

As the intended composability pools are StableSwaps they are far more efficient than Balancer pools at providing the same function and so require approximately 3x less liquidity to facilitate trades at the same slippage. \n\nConversely, with the lower levels of swap fees in these pools a much lower slippage should also be targeted. Converting the 0.2% swap fees to 0.04% results in a proportional target of 0.2% slippage. \n\nWe can therefore target specific liquidity for slippage levels. This is calculated in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UcfBmnf8ZKOWBaqOim5yx2kTDWmE5Vy00NwqnbShPzU/edit#gid=0) and results in $45k of liquidity in a pair being required to cater for OSMO/USDC.grv trades and $62k to cater for OSMO/USDT.grv trades if they were StableSwap pools. This may be excessive as the APR from external Gravity incentives provided in [Proposal 347](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/347) makes these pools attractive and there will be activity from people wanting to join for the rewards rather than using them as a way to utilise Gravity Bridge. A baseline of $45k liquidity from incentives alone will therefore be established. \n\nNow the target Liquidity is established we need to identify an attractive APR for this liquidity level. Comparing alternative stable/stable pools across the Interchain shows that typical yields range from 12% to 28% APR. As additional fees will be generated from swap fees, 12% will be set as a reasonable baseline reward rate. \n\n## Rent vs Buy\nAs the total OSMO spend on incentives is relatively small at the intended liquidity targets, acquiring this liquidity through incentives in the more cost-effective option for approximately 5.5 years before purchasing the liquidity outright became a preferable option.

This is managed by the [txfee](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees) module which specifies a denom to be accepted and an OSMO pool to use as a spot price for the quantity of that denom to accept. Any transaction fees paid in these denoms are collected in the module address and converted into OSMO for distribution to stakers at epoch. \n\nThis whitelist was initially set as all OSMO paired tokens with usable liquidity on 1st December 2021. Since this point there have been many new tokens listed on Osmosis that fees could be paid in, enabling new users to fund the transaction fee for their first trade on the chain. This becomes more important with the minimum fee requirement from [Proposal 354](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/354) implemented in v15. \n\nThis proposal directly adds USDC.axl as a valid fee token to pay transaction fees in. This is prompted by reports of users bridging from Ethereum and being unable to carry out their first transaction, as well as [data provided by Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Playwo/osmosis-fee-currency-overview-possible-additions-b0CBfx) which shows USDC as the most held assets in wallet with no OSMO. \n\nOther assets will be proposed as required or in bulk when the capability to add multiple denoms at the same time exists. \n\n## Test\nThis proposal has been tested on Testnet here: [https://testnet.mintscan.io/osmosis-testnet/proposals/57089](https://testnet.mintscan.io/osmosis-testnet/proposals/57089), adding testnet USDC as a valid fee source and carrying out a transaction here: [https://testnet.mintscan.io/osmosis-testnet/txs/F7311AC7AF48D4CD6E8640532FAF02207274E5F1A84196F9CB1357C537037104](https://testnet.mintscan.io/osmosis-testnet/txs/F7311AC7AF48D4CD6E8640532FAF02207274E5F1A84196F9CB1357C537037104)\n\nCommonwealth Thread: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10478-add-usdc-as-fee-token](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10478-add-usdc-as-fee-token)",0.0013170550871364577],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/USDT\n\nOn passing, this proposal would enable Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/USDT (#831) pool on Osmosis. \n\n## Details\nSuperfluid proposals ask whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance. \n\nThis proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/USDT pool (#831). \n\nIf enabled at the current 50% discount rate, an additional ~88 thousand OSMO can be used to secure the network through staking.\n\n## About USDT\nLaunched in 2014, Tether was the first stablecoin issued and remains the most prevalent stablecoin in use across the crypto ecosystem. \n\nUSDT is currently provided on Osmosis via the Axelar bridge.\n\nWebsite: [https://tether.to/](https://tether.to/)\n\n **Commonwealth Thread**: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10497-enable-superfluid-staking-on-osmousdt](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10497-enable-superfluid-staking-on-osmousdt)",0.00662735584689748],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2023-03-27\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",0.056976318818811045],["Allow Kado Router Contracts to be Uploaded\n\nThis proposal gives the address osmo19vxp8vq8qm368dr026qxh8v82satwaf79y235lfv6wmgpwxx8dtskedaku the ability to upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis without seeking further governance approval for each upload.

In simple words, in an AMM pool, token swaps happen instantly. With StreamSwap, tokens are *streamed* and *swapped* over a fixed period of time.\n\n# Mechanism (short overview)\n\n- StreamSwap swaps require users to create Streams and lock a fixed number of tokens (T1) and swap them for an accepted token (T2) over a fixed-period of time (t)\n    - T1 is added by the Streamer (stream creator) and can NOT be added or removed at any point in time until the end of the Streaming Phase (t)\n    - T2 is the token that subscribers can add or remove at any point in time\n- Bootstrapping Phase — The duration from the stream creation until stream start time is the Bootstrapping Phase. This is when subscribers can use T2 to subscribe. During this phase, no swapping happens.\n- Streaming Phase — The duration from the stream start time to the stream end time is the stream duration (t) during which streaming starts & tokens are swapped.\n    - T1 is streamed to subscribers that subscribed with T2. T2 is streamed to the user the locked T1. Both tokens can be redeemed only at the end of the stream.\n    - The swaps do NOT happen instantly and take place linearly over the duration of the entire stream.\n    - A constant number of T1 are streamed as they are locked and T2 are streamed based on the total time remaining and total unspent T2 tokens\n    - At the end of the Streaming Phase, subscribers can redeem T1 based on their total contribution of T2 and the time at which they subscribed to the stream.\n- Price Discovery — The final price of locked T1 is determined by the total T2 received by the end of the stream.\n\n# **Mechanism (in detail)**\n\nThe mechanism enables communities/DAOs/builders to swap tokens at any stage of a project’s lifecycle — before, during or after the token launch. Of the many use cases, the first use case being explored and focused on is the StreamSwap Protocol for community-driven token launches.\n\n## **1) About**\n\nStreamSwap is the protocol for time-based token swaps on Osmosis. It is developed using CosmWasm smart contracts and will be going through the governance process similar to other smart contract deployments on Osmosis Zone.\n\nThe protocol is built for token swaps and StreamSwap is being utilized initially for **community-driven token launches** as it enables fair price discovery for the token being streamed.\n\n## **2) Stream Creation**\n\nDAOs/Communities/Users can create Streams by:\n\n- locking tokens to stream out (say, FLIX)\n- setting a token to stream in (say, OSMO)\n- setting the stream start time and stream end time\n\n## **3) Phases of a stream**\n\nStreams have two phases:\n\n- Bootstrapping Phase\n- Streaming Phase\n\n## **4) Deposits and Withdrawals**\n- Tokens being streamed out (FLIX in this case), are **locked** during the stream and can NOT be added or removed until the end of the stream.\n- After the stream ends, subscribers can redeem the token being streamed out (FLIX) based on the shares that they receive for the token streamed in\n- Tokens being streamed in (OSMO in this case), can be deposited or withdrawn at any point in time during the stream, giving subscribers the freedom to exit as they see fit.\n\n## **5) Phase 1 — Bootstrapping Phase**\n- Bootstrapping Phase is the period from the “stream creation” time to the “stream start” time.\n- Subscribers can subscribe to the stream by depositing tokens being streamed in (OSMO) and receive shares proportionately. No swaps occur during this phase as the streaming does not start.\n\n## **6) Phase 2 — Streaming Phase**\nIn the Streaming phase, tokens start getting swapped and are streamed at each other.\n- Tokens being streamed out (FLIX) and tokens being streamed in (OSMO) are swapped over the duration of the stream.\n- During the Streaming Phase, tokens being streamed in (OSMO) are spent when they are swapped.

This proposal intends to speed up the reduction in inflation by implementing a single Halvening event at the next software upgrade and signalling approval for an increase of the time between Thirdenings, after the next Thirdening, to two years (730 epochs). \n\nThis would initially reduce the OSMO emitted at each epoch by half, from 547,945 to 273,973 and, after the next thirdening, maintain a lower rate of emissions of 182,649 per epoch for two years. Lowering inflation whilst maintaining a max supply close to the original tokenomic design. \n\n# Effect on Max Supply\nReducing daily emissions while leaving the existing thirdening model in place results in a much flatter inflation curve over time after this initial drop. \n\n[Chart of Inflation Curves](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dd66f5ff-d9db-490a-b986-d369900e3877.1678793221110)\n\nBecause of the reduced daily emissions this reduces the asymptotic max supply to around 780,000,000 OSMO depending on when the reduction is implemented. \n\n[Chart of Max Supply over time](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cf590e55-87a1-44f5-bf48-2b201641b589.1674208175780)\n\nIn order to maintain the maximum supply of around 1 billion, the thirdening length would need to be increased in a future governance proposal to maintain this more moderate rate of emissions for longer. This governance proposal also signals approval for this change, which would be implemented in a future parameter change governance proposal after the next thirdening event has occurred. \n\nThis would result in a slightly lowered Maximum Supply of around 980,000,000 OSMO, varying slightly depending on when the initial reduction is implemented. \n\n[Chart of Max Supply over time with Thirdening Length increase](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/9d5e3131-e2ec-4c4e-81c7-cf2251dec4d6.1679669590844)\n\nFor full modelling of the impact on inflation and emissions over time as well as potential alternatives considered see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m5oj9-gT8xFMUEQy1tO3nC8TR9Tr0WfGlc5DHsFDOGQ)\n# Effect on Rewards\nBy itself, this proposal would proportionately reduce all emissions to Stakers, Liquidity Providers, the Community Pool and Developers by 50% causing a sudden drop in rewards, similar to the smaller drop at each Thirdening event. This may be too large an impact all at once and so this proposal is combined with two other proposals:\n\n## Combined with Adjusting the Ratio of Emissions\nWhen paired with the Proposal to Adjust the Ratio of Emissions, this results in a change in daily emissions of raw OSMO as follows: \n\n* Staking Rewards remain static at 136,986\n* Pool Incentives decrease from 73,973 to 54,795 (-26%)\n* Community Pool decrease from 200,000 to 13,699 (-93%)\n* Developer Rewards decrease in line with inflation 136,986 to 68,493 (-50%)\n\nThis results in no change for staking rewards with varying levels of cuts to all other areas. This also brings an improvement in the Net Yield for Staking and Liquidity rewards, a reversion of the increased growth of the community pool and a cut to the raw OSMO allocated to developer rewards. The latter, being vested, should see a compensatory benefit from the overall reduced inflation. \n\nIn short, the main reduction will be absorbed by the emissions to the community pool to limit the effects on stakers and liquidity providers. \n## Combined with Decreasing the Superfluid Discount\nFurther combining with the Proposal to Decrease the Superfluid Discount to 25%, results in a small cut to staking rewards due to the increased number of OSMO able to be staked while compensating Liquidity Providers with greater rewards from Superfluid Staking. \n\nThis also puts greater emphasis on the Superfluid Staking feature of Osmosis, increasing the share of rewards obtained from it compared to normal liquidity incentives as well as further increasing the security of the network. \n\nTo see or adjust the figures for each of these proposals and see specific impacts interact with this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17T54kCoa2I6BdImY6jDVxfKOyGo4NseiAZD5vbPtaWs/edit#gid=664683755)\n\n# Linked Passing Disclaimer\nThis proposal is being proposed as part of a set of three: \n\n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the current emission rate. \n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the ratio of emissions. \n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the superfluid risk factor. \n\nA proposal from each type is required to pass for any to execute.

This is currently set in the Mint module as: \n* Staking: 25%\n* Pool Incentives: 45%\n* Community Pool: 5%\n* Developer Rewards: 25%\n\nFurther to this, pool incentives have been redirected to the community pool over the last 10 months in order to minimise inflation during the bear market. Because of this the effective emission proportions are currently:\n* Staking: 25%\n* Pool Incentives: 13.5%\n* Community Pool: 36.5%\n* Developer Rewards: 25%\n\nThis proposal aims to solve two common issues raised with Osmosis tokenomics of the net yield from staking rewards and the net yield from larger liquidity pools being negative by adjusting the proportion of emissions received by each. \n\nThe proposed new ratio would be:\n* Staking: 50%\n* Pool Incentives: 20%\n* Community Pool: 5%\n* Developer Rewards: 25%\n\nBy also removing the share of Pool Incentives being redirected to the community pool these are identical to the effective emission proportions\n# Effect on Net Yield\nChanging the emissions in this way causes the Staking Rewards and actual emissions to Liquidity Providers to make up a higher proportion of inflation. Combining regular compounding of rewards with diminishing inflation from a fixed emission schedule, results in a net yield increase when compared to existing inflation as follows:\n* Staking Rewards net yield increases from -3.9% to 26.5%\n* Liquidity Rewards net yield increases from 9.5% to 20.4%\n\nWhile this is beneficial to both stakers and Liquidity Providers, it does not solve the common complaint of the high inflation of Osmosis. Therefore this proposal is combined with two others. \n## Combined with Reducing Emissions\nWhen combined with the proposal to Reduce Emissions this changes the raw OSMO emissions to each route as follows:\n* Staking Rewards remain static at 136,986\n* Liquidity Rewards decrease from 73,973 to 54,795 (-26%)\n* Community Pool decrease from 200,000 to 13,699 (-93%)\n* Developer Rewards decrease from 136,986 to 68,493 (-50%)\n\nThis changes the net yield as follows:\n* Staking Rewards net yield increases from -3.9% to 8.4%\n* Liquidity Rewards net yield decreases from 9.5% to 8.6%\n## Combined with Decreasing the Superfluid Risk Factor\nFurther combining with the Proposal to Decrease the Superfluid Risk Factor to 25%, results in a small cut to staking rewards due to the increased number of OSMO able to be staked while compensating Liquidity Providers with greater rewards from Superfluid Staking, offsetting the reduction in Pool Incentives emissions from this proposals. \n\nThis also puts greater emphasis on the Superfluid Staking feature of Osmosis, increasing the share of rewards obtained from it compared to normal liquidity incentives as well as further increasing the security of the network. \n\nThis proposal in combination with the reduction in Emissions changes the net yield to: \n* Staking Rewards net yield increases from -3.9% to 6.4%\n* Liquidity Rewards net yield increases  from 9.5% to 11.3%\n\nTo see or adjust the figures for each of these proposals and see specific impacts interact with this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17T54kCoa2I6BdImY6jDVxfKOyGo4NseiAZD5vbPtaWs/edit#gid=664683755](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17T54kCoa2I6BdImY6jDVxfKOyGo4NseiAZD5vbPtaWs/edit#gid=664683755)\n# Linked Passing Disclaimer\nThis proposal is being proposed as part of a set of three:\n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the current emission rate.\n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the ratio of emissions.\n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the superfluid risk factor.\n\nA proposal from each type is required to pass for any to execute.

This will allow 75% of OSMO in Superfluid pools to be staked. \n# Details\nSuperfluid staking is a unique feature of Osmosis that allows OSMO locked in liquidity positions the ability to participate in securing the network and voting on proposals. \n\nThis is currently available on most large liquidity pools in Osmosis and causes 37 million, or around 16%, of staked OSMO to come from these positions. \n\nThe mechanism through which this is accomplished is a representative amount of synthetic OSMO being staked on behalf of the locked OSMO. The proportion of this is dictated by a `minimum_risk_factor` parameter that minimises the risk of double counting OSMO when a superfluid-enabled position changes size between the reassessment of its representative OSMO. For a full description of the process see the [module readme](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/superfluid/README.md). \n\nThis has two main functions, it keeps the staking reward earned by the position more uniform by dampening the change in the number of OSMO claiming staking rewards each epoch. More importantly, it increases the cost of voting power attack on the network by discounting the amount of OSMO that an attacker could fake possession of through a double-staking attack. \n\nAs the number of locations that Superfluid Staking is enabled in increases, the less influence a double-staking attack would have as it would cost exponentially more amounts to gain an increasingly smaller share of voting power. With Superfluid staking now active in 23 pools, decreasing this risk factor should be feasible without compromising network security even at a lower level than proposed. \n\nFor a model of this potential attack type see here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eQsf7-6HvdHKbEHOv68SYXZ7\\_U22r56ihZVWqupa0Pk/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eQsf7-6HvdHKbEHOv68SYXZ7_U22r56ihZVWqupa0Pk/edit#gid=0) \n\nThis proposal would cause approximately an additional 19 million OSMO to be staked. This would increase the APR of Superfluid pools by around 2% while dropping the Staking APR by around 1.5%. \n\n\nIn the current scenario where staking net yield is negative and typical Liquidity Rewards are still significantly higher than Staking APR this is not particularly useful for the protocol in itself and so is combined with two other proposals. \n## Combined with Adjusting the Ratio of Emissions\nThis proposal is most effective when combined with the proposed adjustment of the ratio of emissions. This causes a shift in net yield for stakers and liquidity providers, and combined with this proposal, changes the ratio of liquidity rewards that come from Superfluid Staking, placing more emphasis on this core feature. \n\nCombining just these two proposals results in an increase in the proportion of liquidity rewards provided by Superfluid Staking. \n\nAs the adjustment of ratio proposal changes the net yield to be far greater for stakers, the additional OSMO being superfluid staked is far less detrimental to pure rewards and increases the security of Osmosis at a lowered cost. \n## Combined with Reducing Emissions\nReducing emissions is not as attached to this proposal, however, the combination of reducing emissions and changing the ratio results in a change in emissions of raw OSMO as follows:\n* Staking Rewards remain static at 136,986\n* Liquidity Rewards decrease from 73,973 to 54,795 (-26%)\n* Community Pool decrease from 200,000 to 13,699 (-93%)\n* Developer Rewards decrease in line with inflation 136,986 to 68,493 (-50%)\n\nWith an additional 25% of OSMO in superfluid pools being staked, the reduction in raw emissions to liquidity rewards is somewhat compensated for as below:\n\n\n| Liquidity Yields | Current | Proposed | Change |\n| ---| ---| ---| --- |\n| Swap APR (Weighted Avg) | 3.9% | 3.9% | 0% |\n| Incentive APR (Weighted Avg) | 16.4% | 12.1% | -26% |\n| Superfluid APR | 5.5% | 7.6% | 39% |\n| Total APR | 25.7%| 23.6% | -8% |\n\nTo see or adjust the figures for each of these proposals and see specific impacts interact with this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17T54kCoa2I6BdImY6jDVxfKOyGo4NseiAZD5vbPtaWs/edit#gid=664683755](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17T54kCoa2I6BdImY6jDVxfKOyGo4NseiAZD5vbPtaWs/edit#gid=664683755)\n# Linked Passing Disclaimer\nThis proposal is being proposed as part of a set of three:\n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the current emission rate. \n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the ratio of emissions. \n* A proposal that adjusts or confirms the superfluid risk factor. \n\nA proposal from each type is required to pass for any to execute.

Osmosis is equipped with a “tokenfactory” module which allows anyone (human users or smart contracts) to mint native tokens. This is a much desired feature, as native token is superior than CW20 for many reasons which I will not cover here.\n\nGiven that Osmosis currently has a very low gas price, tokenfactory needs a mechanism to deter spamming. This means an attacker creating a massive amount of new tokens that take up nodes’ storage space. It does this by charging a fee, currently set at 10 OSMO, whenever a new token is created. This is known as the `denom_creation_fee` in the code.\n\n## The problem\n\nIt turns out, that this fee approach makes it harder for smart contracts to integrate with tokenfactory, especially ones that need to repeatedly create new tokens. For example,\n\n- A lending protocol that issues tokens representing collateral or debt positions, needs to pay the fee each time a new collateral or debt asset is added.\n\n- A cross-chain transfer protocol that issues voucher tokens, needs to pay the fee the first time a token is transferred.\n\nSuch contracts need to allocate a fee pool for these payments and program relevant payment logics, which in many cases is a non-trivial task.\n\nNote that this complexity has nothing to do with how big the fee is. It is there as long as the fee is non-zero.\n\n## An alternatie solution\n\nEthan Frey proposed an alternative spam-prevention approach in [this Github issue](https://github.com/CosmWasm/token-factory/issues/11). It suggests that, instead of charging a fee, charge a large amount of gas instead.\n\nFrom the perspective of the user who creates a new token, there is no difference from the current approach – they pay the same fee, the only difference being whether it’s a `denom_creation_fee` or a gas fee. However, it makes it much easier for smart contract developers.\n\nThis approach has been [implemented by Juno](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/635) and is expected to be included in its v15 upgrade.\n\n## This proposal\n\nI proposed that Osmosis does the following:\n\n- Introduce the same spam-prevention mechanism, in consistency with Juno’s implementation (most importantly, keep the same protobuf message/query API);\n\n- Set `denom_creation_fee` to zero in the UpgradeHandler of the next chain upgrade.",0.02607058241430175],["Add Stride’s LSTs to Osmosis Frontend\n\nThis is a signaling proposal to request that all Stride's liquid staked tokens (LSTs) be recognized by Osmosis governance and listed on the main Osmosis frontend, so long as the unstaked version of the token is already listed.\n\nThis includes both current and future Stride LSTs.\n\nStride has become a prominent and trusted liquid staking provider in the Cosmos.

The Jackal Protocol will offer 1 million $JKL external incentives over three months. This proposal requests the inclusion of Pool #832 for OSMO incentives for a fixed three-month period relative to the Osmosis incentives allocation process. \n\nBy voting YES, you express your support for enabling matched OSMO incentives on the JKL/OSMO (#832) liquidity pool on Osmosis for a three-month period.\n\n### Advantages for Osmosis:\n\nThe JKL/OSMO liquidity pool has consistently ranked among the top pools in terms of 7-day trading volume and total liquidity for six months. This achievement was made possible despite its limited exposure through the Osmosis Frontier front-end. Ranking within the top 10% of pools in total value locked (TVL) suggests that Osmosis and, ultimately, the Cosmos ecosystem are prepared for a more prominent role for Jackal.\n\nThe JKL/OSMO pool (#832) has remained highly profitable since genesis, supported by external incentives from the Jackal Protocol alone. As the ecosystem's only data storage application-specific blockchain, JKL brings unique value to Osmosis users and the broader Cosmos network. With the launch of cloud storage, it's crucial to ensure that users have a more accessible platform for purchasing and trading $JKL. Offering incentives for $JKL on Osmosis, in addition to the external incentives provided by Jackal, can create a mutually beneficial relationship for both ecosystems.\n\nThe sustained success of the JKL/OSMO liquidity pool reflects the potential for a fruitful, long-term partnership between Osmosis and Jackal Protocol. By matching the incentives provided by Jackal Protocol, Osmosis can further enhance its platform, draw more users, and solidify its position as a reliable and innovative decentralized exchange.\n\n#### What is the Jackal Protocol? \n\nThe Jackal Protocol is a groundbreaking file storage and sharing protocol, leveraging the power of blockchain technology, the Cosmos SDK, and the Tendermint consensus algorithm to ensure utmost security and control for its users. This innovative protocol enables encrypted storage, tied to an on-chain permission management system that grants users ultimate control over their files.

The Stargaze Community would like to extend our help to the Confio Team, who currently has 20-30 people.\n\n## **Cost and Rationale**\n\nThe proposal is for $18,000 in $STARS for three months of public goods funding to the Confio Team. After those 3 months have passed, a renewal of this proposal may take place. Other Cosmos projects have made similar proposals to their community. The amount requested is equivalent in proportion to other community proposals. This helps Confio continue operations and work on Cosmwasm.\n\nThe upside would be getting support from Confio’s invaluable expertise while also helping a project essential to the Cosmos ecosystem.

However, as the Kava network continues to grow, we are witnessing a concentration of power in the hands of a few large validators.\nCurrently, the top 4 validators control more than 44% of the voting power  meaning that any proposal can pass or fail with just their support. In our opinion, this is not a truly decentralized blockchain.\nWe reached out to Kava community on discord about the immense amount control in the hands of a few. We were informed that the top 4 validators do not vote on any proposal. We really appreciate that from the top 4 validators, but we believe in true decentralization. Trusting someone to be responsible has not worked very well lately.\nThis is not true **DECENTRALIZATION** if we just **HOPE** that the largest validators do not vote to harm the network.\n\n**Solution**:\nCurrently, trends suggest that delegators flock to validators offering 0%/unsustainably low commission. This makes it very difficult for validators with a small number of delegators to stay competitive, as validators rely on commissions to cover the expenses of maintaining their nodes.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose setting a minimum validator commission rate of 5%. This will create a more level playing field and help to ensure that smaller and newer validators are able to participate in the network, promoting a more diverse and decentralized network.\nThe top validators continue to accumulate a larger share of Delegations while the bottom 95% of validators are forced to cut costs, reducing the overall security of the network.\n\nLet’s look at a real example of these costs:\nThe minimum hardware costs for a validator are ~$200 per month, while more advanced and secure configurations (ex; Sentry) can cost anywhere between $600-800/month (including maintenance).\nLet’s look at an average validator (Validator at rank #51)\nTotal Stake = 141,737 Kava\nApproximate Staking Reward = 141,737 X 21% = 29,764 Kava\nIf this validator earns 5% commission = 29,764 x 5% = 1,488 Kava = $1,500 = $125 per month\n*Stats as of 2/8/2023**\n\nThis makes it challenging for validators to maintain the minimum server requirements, let alone add additional security features like a Sentry node architecture.\nA more competitive and diverse group of validators will add to the network’s decentralization, increase its’ security, and make it more resistant to malicious actors. As a community, we have a responsibility to take actions that reinforce the security of the Kava network. Setting a minimum commission (similar to those set for other Cosmos IBC networks) is a simple step towards achieving a truly decentralized Kava Network.\n\n**Reference**: Juno implemented a Minimum Validator Commission feature (originally copied from Stargaze).
