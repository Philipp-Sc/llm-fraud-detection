Community management is a critical, complementary aspect of increasing participation in governance.\n* **Announcement channel:** Create a read-only announcement channel in the Cosmos Community Discord, so that new proposals and major discussions can be easily followed.\n* **Tooling friendly posts:** Tag and categorize posts so that they can be easily ingested into existing tooling that validators have setup.\n* **Neutral moderation framework:** Document and follow transparent standards for how the forum is moderated.\n\nAt the end of the period, we will produce a report reflecting on our successes and failures, and recommendations for how the work of maintaining a governance venue can be continuously sustained (e.g., through a DAO). We see this initiative as a process of discovery, where we are learning by doing.\n\nFor more context, you can read through the discussions on this [proposal on the Discourse forum](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-activate-governance-discussions-on-the-discourse-forum-using-community-pool-funds/5833).\n\n## Governance Votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n**YES** - You approve this community spend proposal to deposit 1000 ATOM to a multisig that will spend them to improve governance discussions in the Discourse forum.\n**NO** - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form (please indicate why in the Cosmos Forum).\n**NO WITH VETO** - You are strongly opposed to this change and will exit the network if passed.\n**ABSTAIN** - You are impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\n## Recipient\ncosmos1xf2qwf6g6xvuttpf37xwrgp08qq984244952ze\n## Amount\n1000 ATOM\n\n***Disclosure**: Hypha has an existing contract with the Interchain Foundation focused on the testnet program and improving documentation. This work is beyond the scope of that contract and is focused on engaging the community in governance.*\n\nIPFS pin of proposal on-forum: (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmaq7ftqWccgYCo8U1KZfEnjvjUDzSEGpMxcRy61u8gf2Y)",false],["ClientUpdateProposal\n#64  -  🟢\nUpdate expired client between Cosmoshub and Bostrom\nVoting Start: Wed, 23 Mar 2022 15:34:59 UTC\nVoting End: Wed, 06 Apr 2022 15:34:59 UTC\n👍 96.61%, 👎 0.08%, 🕊️ 3.29%, ❌ 0% \\n\nThis proposal will update the expired client on channel-240 between cosmoshub-4 and the bostrom networks.

The Cosmos Hub was the first lead supporter for Cosmoverse 2021 and we would like to keep it that way for this one as well. Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world.\n\nDescription:\nCosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 27 & 28, 2022.\n\nOur goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.\n\nCosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.\n\nCosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.\n\nWhere do the funds go?\n\nThe sponsorship will help us finance the Cosmoverse conference. \n\nThe main costs include:\n\nConference venue\nF&B (conference + afterparty)\nMarketing leading up to the event\nAudio and visuals\nOfficial afterparty\nLegal costs\nHow does it benefit the ATOM community?\n\nBy allocating 2600 ATOM from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, the Cosmos Hub will become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.\n\nKeynote speech: If this proposal passes, we offer three keynote slots to core Cosmos contributors. We will keep you updated on this topic on the official Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website.\n\nLogo placement: The ATOM logo will be shown as “lead sponsor” on the main conference days. We will make sure everyone at the conference knows that the ATOM community has significantly contributed to covering the conference’s costs and making this a great event.\n\nGeneral Admission Tickets: We will give 15 general admission tickets to the ATOM community. Distribution TBD.\n\nLogo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.\n\nContent distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website\n\nEvent Highlights 2021 and What To Expect\n\nCosmoverse 2021 took place in Lisbon, Portugal. The conference brought the Cosmos community together and kick-started new developments in the interchain! The attendees were provided with food, beverages, and merchandise and were able to listen to keynotes/ panels that were held by Cosmos thought leaders. Cosmoverse is the most community-driven Cosmos conference in the world! It is organized by and for Cosmonauts. \n\nThis means low ticket prices and no VIP areas. If you attend the conference, you have direct access to all speakers and can ask them questions. \n\nCosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia, and will have the same community vibe - but it will be much bigger! \n\nThere will be many Cosmos speakers at the event, two coffee breaks per day including an assortment of food, two 5-star buffet lunches, an NFT room, a public co-working zone, private meeting rooms for sponsors and their teams, and much, much more. We will be able to provide twice as many tickets as the first conference. Medellin is a vibrant city settled in between a beautiful valley in the heart of Colombia. With many activities besides the ones we will be hosting throughout the week. We will ensure that within the Cosmoverse week, attendees will have the possibility to visit side events and meet Cosmonauts from all over the world!\n\nThe Team:\n\nCryptocito: Cryptocito is the most prominent Cosmos YouTuber in the interchain! Who is responsible for bringing all the cosmos together, through outreach, and planning of the event.\n\nBasil Naser: Basil is part of the Cryptocito team. Last year he founded the Cosmoverse conference with Crypotcito. He is responsible for event operations and branding.\n\nFabian Klauder: Fabian is the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES, a Cosmos-focused media company.

These may include decision-making processes and social protocols that have passed governance and thus been accepted as rules.\n\nThe following is factually correct about how ‘NoWithVeto’ currently operates and will continue to operate regardless of this proposal’s outcome: If quorum is met and greater than 1/3 of participating voting power have voted ‘NoWithVeto’, the proposal fails and is considered to be vetoed. In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.\n\n# Discussion\n## Summary of existing definitions\nThis list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.\n\n1. **As a stronger No:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.\n2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.\n3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.\n4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).\n5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.\n6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.\n\n## Censorship\nIt may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3 ⚠️ % of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2 ⚠️  ⚠️ % of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.\n\n## Financial and social cost\n‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2 ⚠️  ⚠️ % of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.\n\nConsequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. \n\nWhile there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.\n\n# Conclusion\nWe are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.\n\nCosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.\n\n# Voting options\nWe propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:\n\n***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***\n\nYour vote on this proposal indicates the following:\n* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.\n* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal. Please indicate why in the  Cosmos Hub Forum post https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898 ⚠️  ⚠️ .\n* **NO WITH VETO** - ¯\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n* **ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/cosmos-hub/proposals/75",false],["*Authors: Lexa Michaelides, Mai Ishikawa Sutton, Sacha Saint-Leger, Sam Hart, Udit Vira*\n\nDownload the full IPFS pin of proposal (including detailed technical and historical context) [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVHVH9WeGy9tTNN9dViqvDn7N79XJJUseKXD1rpyLVckK).\nSee active discussion on the forum [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898).\n\n# Summary\nThis proposal aims to put forward a clear definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ that provides a stand-alone reference for future Cosmos Hub votes.

In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.\n6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.\n\n## Censorship\nIt may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3% of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2% of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.\n\n## Financial and social cost\n‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2% of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.\n\nConsequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. \n\nWhile there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.\n\n# Conclusion\nWe are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.\n\nCosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system.

We examine the technical context and existing discussion on ‘NoWithVeto’, and the range of ways the community understands NoWithVeto. We bridge these ideas into a coherent and thorough definition proposed below.\n\nIf passed, changes will be made to the Cosmos Hub documentation and Cosmos Hub Forum templates to reflect the newly accepted definition.\n\n# Proposed Definition for NoWithVeto\n\n***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***\n\nNote: In this definition we use the term “rules of engagement” to refer to practices adopted by the Cosmos Hub community through governance. These may include decision-making processes and social protocols that have passed governance and thus been accepted as rules.\n\nThe following is factually correct about how ‘NoWithVeto’ currently operates and will continue to operate regardless of this proposal’s outcome: If quorum is met and greater than 1/3 of participating voting power have voted ‘NoWithVeto’, the proposal fails and is considered to be vetoed. In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.\n\n# Discussion\n## Summary of existing definitions\nThis list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.\n\n1. **As a stronger No:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.\n2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.\n3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.\n4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).\n5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing.

This has been reflected in the engineering efforts by various core entities including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems as well as initial users Quicksilver and Neutron. ICS allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain.\nICS is a complex technology that needs to be rigorously tested.

First, it allows for “hub minimalism.” By deploying features on a consumer chain instead of Cosmos Hub, we keep the hub lightweight and reduce the surface area for attacks and vulnerabilities. Second, Interchain Security lowers the barrier for ATOM aligned app chains to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Instead of arranging their own validator set, new app chains can utilize the Cosmos Hub’s existing validator for security. And lastly, Interchain Security accrues value to ATOM and enhances its utility. As new Interchain Secured zones launch, gas fees on these new chains flow back to ATOM stakers through the Hub’s validators.\n## Incentivized Testnet\nFor a successful launch, validators will need to prepare and train for expanding their node operations and governance efforts for every new Interchain Secured chain starting up.

With the creation of the Cosmos Stack (Tendermint, IBC, and SDK) and the development of key technologies for secure economic scaling (Interchain Security and Liquid Staking), the original vision of the Hub has been fulfilled. This document marks the transition to the next phase of the Cosmos Hub as an infrastructure service platform, and a renewed role for ATOM as preferred collateral within the Cosmos Network. It describes two pieces of app-specific functionality, the Interchain Scheduler and Interchain Allocator, which together form a flywheel for accelerating interchain growth. The Interchain Scheduler is a cross-chain block space marketplace, which generates revenues from cross-chain MEV. These revenues are used by the Interchain Allocator to capitalize new Cosmos chains, foster interchain collaboration, and thereby expand the total addressable market of the Scheduler. This paper also describes a new issuance regime optimized for Liquid Staking, where after a 36 month transition period, exponential issuance is reduced to a constant amount of ATOM issued per month.

This document marks the transition to the next phase of the Cosmos Hub as an infrastructure service platform, and a renewed role for ATOM as preferred collateral within the Cosmos Network. It describes two pieces of app-specific functionality, the Interchain Scheduler and Interchain Allocator, which together form a flywheel for accelerating interchain growth. The Interchain Scheduler is a cross-chain block space marketplace, which generates revenues from cross-chain MEV. These revenues are used by the Interchain Allocator to capitalize new Cosmos chains, foster interchain collaboration, and thereby expand the total addressable market of the Scheduler.

The Juno Hacker’s lounge will be a great place for developers/talents to network and connect. In close coordination with the Core-1 team, we will make the best use of the Hacker’s lounge.\n\nDescription:\n\nCosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 26-28, 2022 (3 Day Event)\n\nOur goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.\nWe expect around 1,000 attendees, with the majority coming from Latin American countries - a huge market in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nCosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.\n\nCosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.\n\nWhere do the funds go?\n\n- Conference venue\n- F&B (conference + afterparty)\n- Marketing and communications\n- Production, audio and visuals\n- Operational & logistical costs\nLegal\n\nThe current cost for the 3-day event already exceeds $300k. Receiving support from the Juno community would contribute tremendously to ensuring that Cosmoverse will be a great success.\n\nHow does it benefit the Juno community?\n\nBy allocating 15,000 Juno from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, Juno will become the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum. Besides, the Juno community will have an exclusive 200sqm Hacker’s lounge for all conference days (that no other project has), and can fit 150 people.\n\n- 2 Keynote speeches: If this proposal passes, we offer two keynote slots to the Juno core team (usually it’s only one keynote per project).

It is tightly integrated with Komple Framework releases. \n\n# Community-Centric Marketplace Builder \n\nOur community-centric marketplace builder allows for projects to build and configure their own marketplaces without needing to touch a single line of code. \n\nWe call this tool Marbu. \n\nMarbu allows DAOs, projects and individuals to shape their projects based on their custom needs. \n\nWith the use of modularity and contract interactions made possible by the Komple Framework, all projects within Marbu will have the ability to collaborate, scale up and put creativity first. \n\nWhile having the tools for such things, projects and Juno community will also benefit from the secondary sale fees - extracting the value they are bringing. \n\nSimply, Marbu aims to be the home of NFT based applications on Juno Network. \n\n# Project Timeline \n\nKomple is asking for a total of 320K USD from Juno community.

Accordingly, the dev team will begin working on the implementation.\\nThe proposed mechanism will not reduce or exclude the presence of other incentive programs such as Hack Juno, grants, or governance-approved funding.\\n## Voting\\n* By voting **YES** on this proposal, you agree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented.\\n* By voting **NO** on this proposal, you disagree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented.\\n* By voting **NO WITH VETO**, you disagree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented, and additionally intend to contribute towards proposal rejection and burning of proposal deposit if NoWithVeto votes are greater than a third of voting power.\\n* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you decline to give an opinion on the proposition.",false],["UnknownProposalType\n#55  -  🟢\nUnknownTitle\nVoting Start: Wed, 23 Nov 2022 20:29:47 UTC\nVoting End: Mon, 28 Nov 2022 20:29:47 UTC\n👍 96.06%, 👎 0.29%, 🕊️ 3.62%, ❌ 0.01% \\n\nUnknownDescription\nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/juno/proposals/55",false],["UnknownDescription",false],["UnknownTitle\n\nUnknownDescription",false],["TextProposal\n#57  -  🟢\nImplement Price Oracle on Juno\nVoting Start: Sat, 26 Nov 2022 18:16:57 UTC\nVoting End: Thu, 01 Dec 2022 18:16:57 UTC\n👍 89.53%, 👎 1.55%, 🕊️ 8.88%, ❌ 0.02% \\n\n# Implement Price Oracle on Juno\\n\\nThis is a signaling proposal regarding the implementation of an on-chain Price Oracle to Juno.\\n\\nCommonwealth Proposal and Discussions can be seen  here https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7325-oracle ⚠️  and  here https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7751-implement-price-oracle-on-juno.\\n\\n### ⚠️  Pros\\n\\n- A Price Oracle supports many DeFi use cases that are currently difficult (or impossible) to implement on Juno.

This result is inequitable and contrary to the ethos of Osmosis.\n\nShould this proposal pass, the liquidity rewards will be distributed to applicable recipients from the community pool after a future software upgrade performed by the Osmosis Team. We thank you for your consideration.\n\nNote:\nThis proposal is a revision of proposal #11, which proposed to distribute 20% of the rewards to current LPs. Following discussions with community members (particularly on Discord), a strong opinion was that a 20% concession would set a bad precedent. The issue is that, regardless of what the intention is, rewarding other LPs in this context is essentially vote buying. We strongly believe that proposals for community spending should be free of bribes.",false],["TextProposal\n#13  -  🟢\nSemi-Automatic Incentive Adjustments Model\nVoting Start: Sat, 17 Jul 2021 23:23:49 UTC\nVoting End: Tue, 20 Jul 2021 23:23:49 UTC\n👍 99.03%, 👎 0.39%, 🕊️ 0.52%, ❌ 0.04% \\n\nThis text proposal is a non-binding consensus check around the idea of using the following model to make routine adjustments to liquidity incentives.\\n\\nVoting Yes on this proposal signals a desire to see such adjustments proposed, and an openness (but not a commitment) to agreement on them.

Bug details at the end.\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal suggests doing an emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v6 binary. This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The  v6.0.0 ⚠️  software version https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v6.0.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  is fully state-compatible with `v5.0.0` until the upgrade block `2464000`, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v3 upgrade (prop 17), used when the governance deposit mechanism was broken.\\\\n\\\\nThe proposed upgrade block height of 2464000 is estimated to be at December 20, 2021, 16:00 UTC (Monday).\\\\n\\\\nAll validators, and full node operators should update their software to version `v6.0.0 ⚠️ ` prior to block height 2464000. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\\\\n\\\\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\\\\n\\\\n## Actionable(s)\\\\n\\\\n* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0 ⚠️ ` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0 ⚠️ `, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0 ⚠️ .\\\\n* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\\\\n* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\\\\n\\\\n## Failure case and risks involved\\\\n\\\\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - \"validators\" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis ⚠️ )\\\\n\\\\nNote: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\\\\n\\\\n## Governance procedure\\\\n\\\\n A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\\\\n A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\\\\n\\\\nDeposits are intended to be used by validators here.\\\\n\\\\n- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key. Please do this, even if your validator operator key is behind a multisig. This is a good time to take advantage of authz, to allow easier depositing & voting.\\\\n- Once over 66% of voting power has signalled readiness, this upgrade proposal is considered valid.\\\\n- Should this proposal fail to gather readiness signalling from two-thirds of voting power by December 20th 4AM UTC, the upgrade proposal should be considered failed and validators should revert to the old binary prior to block 2464000.\\\\n\\\\n## Testing methodology\\\\n\\\\nThis upgrade has been tested to be compatible with v5.0.0 until the upgrade height on a testnet. This was done by having a v6.0.0 ⚠️  validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected). The v6.0.0 ⚠️  node could then receive IBC transfers.\\\\n\\\\n## Bug Details\\\\n\\\\nRelevant issue:  osmosis-labs/osmosis #665 https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/665\\\\n\\\\nTL;DR ⚠️  - There was a subtle misconfiguration in the Osmosis app.go ⚠️ .

This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v3 upgrade (prop 17), used when the governance deposit mechanism was broken.\\\\n\\\\nThe proposed upgrade block height of 2464000 is estimated to be at December 20, 2021, 16:00 UTC (Monday).\\\\n\\\\nAll validators, and full node operators should update their software to version `v6.0.0` prior to block height 2464000. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\\\\n\\\\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\\\\n\\\\n## Actionable(s)\\\\n\\\\n* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0`, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0.\\\\n* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\\\\n* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\\\\n\\\\n## Failure case and risks involved\\\\n\\\\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - \"validators\" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis)\\\\n\\\\nNote: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\\\\n\\\\n## Governance procedure\\\\n\\\\n A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\\\\n A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\\\\n\\\\nDeposits are intended to be used by validators here.\\\\n\\\\n- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key. Please do this, even if your validator operator key is behind a multisig. This is a good time to take advantage of authz, to allow easier depositing & voting.\\\\n- Once over 66% of voting power has signalled readiness, this upgrade proposal is considered valid.\\\\n- Should this proposal fail to gather readiness signalling from two-thirds of voting power by December 20th 4AM UTC, the upgrade proposal should be considered failed and validators should revert to the old binary prior to block 2464000.\\\\n\\\\n## Testing methodology\\\\n\\\\nThis upgrade has been tested to be compatible with v5.0.0 until the upgrade height on a testnet. This was done by having a v6.0.0 validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected).

Namely, make external incentive matching follow the same bias factor present in Osmosis. This concretely means that the Osmo-side bonus APY for external incentive ATOM pools will halve. However, the swap fee APY, swap-fee induced osmo APY, plus the actual external incentive APY will remain as before. This a better allocation for incentives that governance has already agreed upon, and it was inconsistent that this was not already being done for external incentive matching.",false],["TextProposal\n#129  -  🟢\nMatch External Incentives to DSM/OSMO and ATOM/DSM pairs\nVoting Start: Sat, 22 Jan 2022 07:24:02 UTC\nVoting End: Tue, 25 Jan 2022 07:24:02 UTC\n👍 95.44%, 👎 1.36%, 🕊️ 3.17%, ❌ 0% \\n\n**Proposal descriptions:**\n\n Pool #618 (ATOM/DSM) https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/618 ⚠️  and  Pool #619 (DSM/OSMO) https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/619 ⚠️  have been live since 13 January 2022 with promising growth in liquidity and transaction volume so far.

continue to be over-matched according to the external incentive dollar value provided according the bias established in proposal 128 and only capped by the 30% global cap established in proposal 127. \\n\\n This proposal asks two questions of Osmosis governance and was combined as they are linked.\\n The external incentive program established in Proposal 47 has resulted in huge amounts of external tokens being distributed to Osmosis Liquidity Providers as rewards. However, the recent external incentives for STARS, HUAHUA and CMDX, as well as the proposed external ROWAN incentives in #132, have been substantially higher than previous ones. Matching these has resulted in a large amount of the daily Osmosis incentive distribution being used for matching purposes and has had proportionately reduced the APR across other pools without matching incentives.\\n A bias to external incentives has been confirmed in Proposal 128. This is not a simple weighting to provide non-Osmosis incentives 50% of the rewards that Osmosis pools do. Instead the weight of non-OSMO pools is decreased by 50% as well as the weight of OSMO pools being raised by 50%.\\n As a result of this, on the next semi-automatic incentives proposal, each  of external incentives on non-OSMO pools will not only be matched by bash.50 in OSMO rewards, but would also result in OSMO pools being matched by .50. (In both instances up to the 30% overall cap coming into effect). \\n\\n This proposal requests that the maximum match for  in external incentives is  in OSMO. \\n\\n These external incentives have also generated a lot of hype around high APRs, partially funded by Osmosis matching these high external incentives on new pools. This may have caused price increases of these tokens as liquidity providers seek to buy in to pools with higher APRs. In turn causing the price to further increase and therefore requiring even more OSMO to match the, now higher, dollar value of external incentives.\\n In order to ensure that the OSMO spent on matching these external incentives is useful for the ecosystem, this proposal requests that a cap on the dollar value of OSMO used for matching be added based on the fees generated by the pool. Fees generated give an indicator of how actively a pool is used and the value that the additional liquidity attracted by this external matching will bring to Osmosis. This cap would be based on the Subsidy Bias model that is in use for normal incentives, promoting the addition of external incentives on OSMO pools and reducing Osmosis' spend on other pools. I.E.  of fees generated in OSMO pools would allow, currently, 3x the dollar amount of OSMO to be available to meet external matching up to the other caps compared to  of fees in a non-OSMO pool.\\n\\n In short this limits the bonus OSMO APR provided by the incentive matching program to the non-matched APR. \\n\\n  Whichever of these caps is hit first would be the maximum dollar amount of OSMO that Osmosis uses to match incentives. \\n\\n Model based on figures from the Semi-Automatic Incentives Proposal #131: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUST7SUkdr3__HgMqfFxItkmTaXhd1Nmsk-Ji0EASNs ⚠️  \\n\\n Commonwealth Thread on fee based cap: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3578-proposal-external-incentive-matching-caps-on-asset-pairs ⚠️  \\n\\n Commonwealth Thread on 1:1 matching: https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposal/discussion/3577-proposal-osmo-bias-on-external-incentives-should-not-overmatch-dollar-value/ ⚠️ \nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/osmosis/proposals/133",false],["Voting YES for this proposal indicates that matching external incentives will no more than double the standard OSMO incentives for a pool and not be matched more than 1:1 in dollar value.\\n\\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that external incentives will continue to be over-matched according to the external incentive dollar value provided according the bias established in proposal 128 and only capped by the 30% global cap established in proposal 127. \\n\\n This proposal asks two questions of Osmosis governance and was combined as they are linked.\\n The external incentive program established in Proposal 47 has resulted in huge amounts of external tokens being distributed to Osmosis Liquidity Providers as rewards.

The wallet will then delegate all funding to Redline validation in exchange for consulting services related to Defi, DAOs,and structuring.  This delegation will hold for a minimum of 6 months.  At the end of 6 months the two working groups will assess if we need to increase, decrease or undelegate funding.  Any funds not used for delegations to Redline will be sent directly back to the community pool.  When services are no longer needed or wanted, this funding will return directly back to the community pool.  This is a no loss scenario for the community pool, as the requested funds will never be spent or leave the multi-sig wallet except to be returned to the community pool. \n\n The members of the OSL and OMM have vetted Redline and its services and their current engagements with many reputable teams and projects. At a high level Redline will be providing key services and recommendations to reduce major bottlenecks related to structuring recommendations, support, and logistical help. In fact they have already completed bodies of work. Given our previous unsuccessful efforts to solicit these services from various other vendors, Redline has already delivered better than expected results in a timely manner \n\n This approach will be the first example of community funded consultation for community funded initiatives.  The delegation will ensure the two groups can confidently engage with adequate consulting teams necessary for them to have maximum impact with the funding allocated to them.  This service can be used by other working groups in Osmosis and is not exclusive to Support and Marketing.

The CHEQ community has added CHEQ external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ (pool #617) and would request the support of the Osmosis community to add OSMO incentives to pool 617.\n\nA previous version of this proposal was submitted with a mismatched title with the feedback provided by the Osmosis community that this should be corrected and resubmitted: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/144\n\n**Proposal Discussion on Commonwealth**: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3671-incentivize-atomcheq-pool-617\n\n**Learn more about cheqd**:\n - Telegram: https://t.me/cheqd \n - Twitter: https://twitter.com/cheqd_io \n - Website: https://www.cheqd.io \n Medium blog: https://blog.cheqd.io \n - Product Roadmap for 2022: https://cheqd.link/product-vision-2022",false],["TextProposal\n#152  -  🟢\nReducing the Impact of Volume Manipulation\nVoting Start: Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:22:33 UTC\nVoting End: Sun, 20 Feb 2022 18:22:33 UTC\n👍 34.43%, 👎 2.82%, 🕊️ 62.7%, ❌ 0.03% \\n\nVoting YES for this proposal indicates acceptance of measures to restrict volume manipulation on Osmosis as well as the use of the linked new Master Incentive sheet. \\n\\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that volume manipulation should not be restricted by Osmosis governance and/or disapproval of the new linked Master incentive sheet. \\n\\n Background \\n\\n Osmosis determines how much it it spends on a pool's incentives based on the swap fees generated in order to encourage liquidity to the most useful pool. \\n Wash Trading is the practice of swapping tokens within a pool for the sole purpose of artificially increasing the volume traded within that pool. \\n Wash Trading is therefore a dishonest way of increasing the incentives allocated to a pool which does not need additional liquidity to cater for genuine traders. \\n\\n Proposal \\n\\n This proposal has 3 linked parts. \\n\\n 1.

A \"superfluid discount factor\" parameter exists for the superfluid module to ensure stability in the early rollout of superfluid staking, the superfluid discount factor parameter is set to 50% in this upgrade. This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.\\n\\nThe user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.\\n\\nHere is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:\\n\\n#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing\\n*Condition*\\n- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.\\n- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.\\n- Suppose you have designated validator \"Dogemosis\" as your superfluid validator.\\n- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%\\n\\n*Result*\\n- Your delegation to \"Dogemosis\" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.\\n- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.\\n- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ⚠️  ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares. In essence, effective slashing rate increases to the lower the risk factor is set to.\\n\\n#### On Changes to the delegation amount depending on changes in spot price\\nLets now suppose the spot price in the pool changes during this epoch to be 1 ATOM = 1 OSMO, and your LP share changes to being `(75 OSMO, 75 ATOM)`. Upon the next epoch, the effective staked OSMO amount will be calculated as `75 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 67.5 ⚠️  OSMO` to reflect the change in the underlying OSMO amount of the LP token.\\n\\nAs the amount of OSMO backing the LP share increased (hence increasing the effective superfluid staked amount), the staking rewards will also increase.\nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/osmosis/proposals/157",false],["# Osmosis Carbon Upgrade\\n\\nThis proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the [v7.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `3401000`, which is estimated to occur on February 28, UTC 8:00PM.

This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.\\n\\nThe user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.\\n\\nHere is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:\\n\\n#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing\\n*Condition*\\n- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.\\n- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.\\n- Suppose you have designated validator \"Dogemosis\" as your superfluid validator.\\n- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%\\n\\n*Result*\\n- Your delegation to \"Dogemosis\" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.\\n- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.\\n- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares. In essence, effective slashing rate increases to the lower the risk factor is set to.\\n\\n#### On Changes to the delegation amount depending on changes in spot price\\nLets now suppose the spot price in the pool changes during this epoch to be 1 ATOM = 1 OSMO, and your LP share changes to being `(75 OSMO, 75 ATOM)`. Upon the next epoch, the effective staked OSMO amount will be calculated as `75 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 67.5 OSMO` to reflect the change in the underlying OSMO amount of the LP token.\\n\\nAs the amount of OSMO backing the LP share increased (hence increasing the effective superfluid staked amount), the staking rewards will also increase.",false],["Osmosis v7 Carbon Upgrade\n\n# Osmosis Carbon Upgrade\\n\\nThis proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the [v7.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `3401000`, which is estimated to occur on February 28, UTC 8:00PM. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \\n\\n## Upgrade features\\n\\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\\n* Superfluid Staking\\n* Permissioned CosmWasm\\n* IAVL improvements (improved epoch times)\\n* UX improvements around LP bonding\\n\\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v7.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\\n\\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\\n\\nAll nodes will require 64GB of memory. This must consist of a **minimum** of 32GB of RAM, while the remaining 32GB can be swap. For best results, use 64GB of physical memory. Note that this is **double the recommendation for the Boron upgrade**. Also note that the inclusion of wasm means that nodes must use amd64 to run.\\n\\nPlease refer to the following setup instructions on how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md).\\n\\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you should install the v1.0.0 release of cosmovisor) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v7.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin/`.\\n\\nIf you do not wish to use cosmovisor, be prepared to upgrade at around 8:00PM UTC, February 28th if this proposal passes.\\n\\nThe Osmosis blockchain will halt when network reaches the halt height. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v7.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\\n\\n## Details of upgrade time\\n\\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `3401000`, anticipated to be at `Monday February 28th 8:00PM UTC`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.46 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\\n\\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 120 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\\n\\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\\n\\n### Testing your upgrade setup\\n\\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\\n\\n\\n### Superfluid delegation \\n\\nIn this upgrade\"s superfluid module, you can stake LP shares for specific governance-approved pools.

Due to Osmosis paying for liquidity based on fees, any fees generated by trading in this pool would result in Osmosis paying to incentivize liquidity that is not needed due to the unbonded protocol liquidity. This instead can act as a source of both tokens to seed other, incentivized pools, to increase liquidity and so stability of both NCT and REGEN across Osmosis as a whole through arbitrage.\nAs an added benefit, based on average swap fees, around 5,400 NCT would be acquired by this community pool held liquidity per year.

(#662) pool on Osmosis.\n\nBy voting **NO** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the CRBRUS/OSMO (#662) pool on Osmosis.\n\n**Details**\nThis is a signaling proposal to include the **CRBRUS/OSMO** (#662) pool into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. This proposal results from the community lobbying to submit a proposal to have incentives added to the pool to help develop liquidity. In addition, the community feels that the upcoming airdrop to OSMO stakers will help generate further liquidity in the pool by having incentives and incentivizing those who provide liquidity. After this proposal has passed governance, this CRBRUS pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.\n\n**Current External Incentives**\nCerberus stakers have already voted on a proposal for external incentives on pool #662.

Other partnerships are currently in the works to expand the use-case of Cerberus as a utility token on other networks.\n\nWebsite: https://cerberus.zone/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CerberusZone\nTelegram: https://t.me/cerberuszonegroup\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/u95WW9SKda\nMedium: https://medium.com/@cerberus_zone\n\n",false],["TextProposal\n#205  -  🟢\nCanonical Ethereum Bridge Provider: Approval Voting Procedures & Reciprocal Expectations for Bridge Provision\nVoting Start: Wed, 20 Apr 2022 20:02:06 UTC\nVoting End: Mon, 25 Apr 2022 20:02:06 UTC\n👍 99.37%, 👎 0.27%, 🕊️ 0.33%, ❌ 0.01% \\n\nVoting YES to this Proposal means that you assent to using the following procedures to vote for a Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider (BSP) for app.osmosis.zone ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ , a relationship whose initial, mutable expectations are outlined below.\\n\\nVoting NO means you do not assent to these procedures and expectations. VETO and ABSTAIN have their normal functions.\\n\\nLIMITATION OF SCOPE: A YES vote assents to these procedures ONLY for the series of five Osmosis governance proposals outlined below. To guard against malicious or confusing proposals, only proposals made by osmo19mywfjzj324w5ukf7ss6jak0dg9hnljfp0rfx4 will be considered under these rules. Future use of these (or similar) procedures must be separately approved by governance.\\n\\nAPPROVAL VOTING PROCEDURES: Five Osmosis Governance Proposals will be proposed under these rules, one each for the four bridge service providers being voted upon: 1) Axelar, 2) Gravity Bridge, 3) Nomad, and 4) Wormhole, as well as 5) a “do nothing” proposal.\\n\\nWINNER: The Bridge Service Provider (BSP) proposal (or “do nothing”) from this set that receives the highest total amount of YES voting power at the end of the collective voting period will win, provided that QUORUM is reached and a RUN-OFF is not activated. That BSP will enter into a relationship with Osmosis DAO whose initial parameters are outlined below.\\n\\nNO, NO WITH VETO, and ABSTAIN votes will have NO EFFECT on the tally of yes voting power for the approval voting results. In other words, a bridge could win the approval vote even if it has more NO/VETO vote power than YES, as long as it has the most YES voting power among the BSP proposals.\\n\\nQUORUM: As long as the total YES voting power received across the 5 approval voting proposals is equivalent to regular Osmosis quorum (20% of total Osmosis voting power), quorum will be considered to have been reached.\\n\\nRUN-OFF: At the end of the collective voting period, any BSP or “do nothing” proposal that has received within 15% of the leading proposal’s total will be entered into a run-off governed by these same rules and expectations, except that the run-off result will be final, with no further run-offs. This 15% will be measured as a percentage of the total voting power available on Osmosis for this set of proposals (NOT 15% of the top vote-getter’s YES voting power).\\nFor example, assuming 122M total staked OSMO available to vote, the 15% run-off spread is 18.3M. Therefore, if Bridge X gets 53M YES voting power, Bridge Y gets 35M, and Bridge Z gets 25M, Bridges X and Y will be entered into a run-off.\\n\\nBRIDGE SERVICE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP EXPECTATIONS:\\nThe Osmosis DAO is asking Osmosis Labs to integrate the BSP into app.osmosis.zone ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  to provide canonical, unprefixed bridged assets from Ethereum. The implementation details will be left to Osmosis Labs and the chosen BSP, but the general shape of the initial expectations is as follows. These expectations are subject to change as circumstance, future governance, and social consensus dictate.\\n\\nFrom Osmosis, the BSP can expect:\\nDefault Asset List – the Ethereum assets bridged by the selected provider will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  default asset list – i.e. their bridged ETH and ERC-20 assets will be ETH, USDC, etc., all other bridges' assets would be bridge1ETH, bridge2USDC, and the like. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions. In the near future, we expect custom token lists to become the norm in Cosmos, as they are on Ethereum, so that users can search for and import tokens that they want to interact with.\\nOsmosis Incentives – the DAO commits to prioritizing the assets of the canonical bridge, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools–under the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.\\nIntegration – Osmosis expects to work closely with the BSP. At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).\\n\\nFrom the BSP, Osmosis can expect:\\nIntegration / Availability – the BSP will help optimize integrations in a timely manner in accordance with Osmosis’ stated goals of achieving deposits and withdrawals from the app.osmosis.zone ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  UI and Keplr Wallet (without pass-through to the bridge UI).\\nLiquidity Mining Incentives – if a project’s proposal included the promise of incentives (e.g. Axelar, at least 1% of Axelar tokens to be used for incentives on Osmosis).\\n\\nRevocability / At-will / Permissionless: As noted, these expectations are preliminary and subject to change as the DAO, developers, and the bridge team see fit. Osmosis DAO and the BSP will be working with each other for their mutual benefit, without contractual promise or obligation. It will be up to the BSP team to maintain a good relationship with Osmosis Labs regarding the front-end implementation details. Osmosis DAO empowers Osmosis Labs to change BSPs if in their estimation, the relationship has become unworkable, or the technical landscape suggests a superior solution, subject to ratification by the DAO.\\nShould the arrangement become unworkable for either party for whatever reason, the arrangement can be changed or terminated without notice. Any damages for bad behavior (broken promises, bridge failures) will be to reputation alone.

End: Sun, 08 May 2022 16:13:29 UTC\n👍 93.43%, 👎 0.35%, 🕊️ 6.2%, ❌ 0% \\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/USDC (#678) pool on Osmosis.\\n\\n By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/USDC (#678) pool on Osmosis.\\n\\n Details\\n This is a signalling proposal to

In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools–under the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.\\n\\nCommonwealth Thread: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/5099-approve-axelar-via-moonbeam-as-the-canonical-polkadot-bridge",false],["UnknownProposalType\n#250  -  🟢\nUnknownTitle\nVoting Start: Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:59:44 UTC\nVoting End: Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:59:44 UTC\n👍 89.82%, 👎 0.43%, 🕊️ 9.68%, ❌ 0.05% \\n\nUnknownDescription\nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/osmosis/proposals/250",false],["UnknownDescription",false],["UnknownTitle\n\nUnknownDescription",false],["CommunityPoolSpendProposal\n#251  -  🟢\nOsmosis Ministry of Marketing Funding Round: June - November 2022\nVoting Start: Wed, 01 Jun 2022 06:51:45 UTC\nVoting End: Mon, 06 Jun 2022 06:51:45 UTC\n👍 45.71%, 👎 8.25%, 🕊️ 45.94%, ❌ 0.09% \\n\nThis proposal is for funding the Osmosis Ministry of Marketing for the on-chain funding period of June 2022 - November 2022. \n\nThe full proposal can be found here: https://osmosis-dao.gitbook.io/osmosis-ministry-of-marketing-second-funding-round/ ⚠️  \n\nCommonwealth post here: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/5033-2nd-funding-round-for-omm ⚠️ \n\nTransparency report here:\nhttps://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4710-transparency-report-for-first-6-months-of-omm ⚠️  \nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/osmosis/proposals/251",false],["This proposal is for funding the Osmosis Ministry of Marketing for the on-chain funding period of June 2022 - November 2022. \n\nThe full proposal can be found here: https://osmosis-dao.gitbook.io/osmosis-ministry-of-marketing-second-funding-round/ \n\nCommonwealth post here: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/5033-2nd-funding-round-for-omm\n\nTransparency report here:\nhttps://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4710-transparency-report-for-first-6-months-of-omm ",false],["Osmosis Ministry of Marketing Funding Round: June - November 2022\n\nThis proposal is for funding the Osmosis Ministry of Marketing for the on-chain funding period of June 2022 - November 2022. \n\nThe full proposal can be found here: https://osmosis-dao.gitbook.io/osmosis-ministry-of-marketing-second-funding-round/ \n\nCommonwealth post here: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/5033-2nd-funding-round-for-omm\n\nTransparency report here:\nhttps://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4710-transparency-report-for-first-6-months-of-omm ",false],["SoftwareUpgradeProposal\n#252  -  🟢\nOsmosis v9 Nitrogen Upgrade\nVoting Start: Wed, 01 Jun 2022 21:00:48 UTC\nVoting End: Mon, 06 Jun 2022 21:00:48 UTC\n👍 99.52%, 👎 0%, 🕊️ 0.46%, ❌ 0% \\n\n## Osmosis Nitrogen Upgrade\\n\\nThis is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v9.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 4707300, which is estimated to occur on Tuesday June 7th, UTC 16:00.

This is hard to see at first glance due to the market conditions but becomes much more obvious when viewing liquidity in terms of token amounts rather than value locked.\\n\\n WETH Token Liquidity https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/839d69c5-aa82-4ede-a02c-d43711abde7f.1656416646064\\n ⚠️  WBTC Token Liquidity https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/8e602367-a368-49a4-a127-aa81b4586ad0.1656416653281\\n ⚠️  ATOM Token Liquidity https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fcd8f808-8161-4616-b66a-2536514f0ead.1656416664670\\n ⚠️  USDC Liquidity https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/053acb34-3552-4275-af7e-3d46f25c5585.1656416675731\\nATOM ⚠️  and USDC liquidity have been hit during this period by being an offramp for Terra and part of the loss due to exploited funds but have not seen a significant change in rate of growth due to the incentive spend change.\\n\\nThis raises the question of how much we are overpaying liquidity providers to bring their liquidity to Osmosis.  This overpayment contributes to the inflation of the Osmosis token and, if it is not required, then these tokens could be used either during the next hype period to attract new users, to pay for more teams to develop additional utilities for the Osmosis ecosystem or be used to provide incentives to other protocols building on Osmosis.\\n\\nIn the following model, we can see the estimated APR that a user would obtain if they were to stake the two separate halves of the liquidity pool on their own networks and how that compares with providing liquidity.

This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the STRD/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives.

This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the stOSMO/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.\n\nstOSMO/OSMO (#833) is currently incentivized with STRD from the Stride Foundation, at a rate of 10,000 STRD per day. The Stride Foundation will continue incentivizing this pool for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf approved, OSMO incentives to the stOSMO pool would increase liquidity depth, allowing the pool to function as a stable oracle for the price of stOSMO and absorb stOSMO liquidations. If liquidity is deep enough, stOSMO will likely be a collateral option for these coming Osmosis applications: Mars, Membrane, Margined, and Levana.
