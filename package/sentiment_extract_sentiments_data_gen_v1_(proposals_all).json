We will develop and document governance features and practices, and then communicate these to the broader Cosmos community.\n\n_Future_\nAt the end of Q1, we‚Äôll publish recommendations for the future of the Cosmos GWG, and ideally we‚Äôll be prepared to submit a proposal based upon those recommendations for Q2 2020. We plan to continue our work in blockchain governance, regardless of whether the Hub passes our proposals.\n\n-=-=-\n\nCosmos forum: https://forum.cosmos.network/c/governance\nCosmos GWG Telegram channel: https://t.me/hubgov\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CosmosGov",false],["CommunityPoolSpendProposal\n#25  -  üü¢\nCosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades\nVoting Start: Tue, 12 May 2020 21:34:51 UTC\nVoting End: Tue, 26 May 2020 21:34:51 UTC\nüëç 99.99%, üëé 0%, üïäÔ∏è 0%, ‚ùå 0% \\n\nCosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades\n\nCommunity-spend proposal submitted by Ethan Frey (https://github.com/ethanfrey ‚ö†Ô∏è ) of Confio UO (http://confio.tech/ ‚ö†Ô∏è ) and CosmWasm (https://www.cosmwasm.com ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è )\n\n-=-=-\n\nFull proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è \nForum Post: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-cosmwasm-on-cosmos-hub/3629 ‚ö†Ô∏è \n\n-=-=-\n\nAmount to spend from the community pool: 25000 ATOMs\n\nTimeline: 2-4 months from approval\n\nDeliverables:\n1.

In the battle to build and ship IBC this central vision has remained unchanged, but with so much focus on the need to build out other zones with real economies to support this network (the CosmosSDK is the result of this effort), the idea of the hub as an Interchain Router hasn't been discussed in a serious context for quite a while.\n\nThis is understandable: Cosmos needed so many other pieces to come together before the Hub had a chance to even start performing this function. Those other zones have been created, they each have products and economies. The bootstrapping era of IBC is well underway.\n\nThese new zones joining are noticing a problem: they need to maintain a large amount of infrastructure (archive nodes and relayers for each counterparty chain) to connect with all the chains in the ecosystem, a number that is continuing to increase quickly.\n\nLuckly this problem has been anticipated and IBC architected to accomodate multi-hop transactions. However, a packet forwarding/routing feature was not in the initial IBC release. This proposal aims to fix this for the Hub.\n\nThis is a proposal to include a new feature to IBC on the Hub that allows for multi-hop packet routing for ICS20 transfers. By appending an intermediate address, and the port/channel identifiers for the final destination, clients will be able to outline more than one transfer at a time.\n\nStrangelove Ventures has delivered an  IBC Middleware module https: //github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/373 that will allow the hub to play the role of IBC Router that was always envisioned for it. Passing of this propsal will begin the era of the Hub offering interchain services to other chains and profiting from those relationships.\n\nTo pay the hub validators and stakers, this proposal implements a governance configurable fee (which we propose should be initially set to 0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è  to encourage adoption) that will be taken out of each packet and given to the community pool. The community pool will then periodically trade these fees for ATOM and distribute them to staked holders. The exact distribution method of these fees is left TBD in this proposal as it is not initially required and can be implemented in a future governance proposal. One way to do this would be using the  Groups module https: //docs.cosmos.network/master/architecture/adr-042-group-module.html, Community spend proposals and the Gravity DEX.\n\nA vote YES on this proposal indicates that this feature should be included in the next hub upgrade.

It means there is no record of discussion that voters can confidently point to for context, potentially leading to governance decisions becoming delegitimized by stakeholders.\n\nThe requested amount will be sent to a multisig comprising individuals (members listed below) who can ensure that the tokens are spent judiciously. We believe stewardship of the forum requires:\n\n* **Moderation**: Format, edit, and categorize posts; Standardize titles and tags; Monitor and approve new posts; Archive posts.\n* **Facilitation**: Ask clarifying questions in post threads; Summarize discussions; Provide historical precedence to discussions.\n* **Engagement**: Circulate important posts on other social channels to increase community participation; Solicit input from key stakeholders.\n* **Guidance**: Orient and assist newcomers; Guide proposers through governance process; Answer questions regarding the forum or Cosmos ecosystem.\nThe work to steward the forum will be carried out by members of  Hypha Worker Co-op https://hypha.coop/ ‚ö†Ô∏è  and individuals selected from the community to carry out scoped tasks in exchange for ATOM from this budget.\n## Multisig Members\n* Hypha: Mai Ishikawa Sutton (Hypha Co-op)\n* Validator: Daniel Hwang (Stakefish)\n* Cosmos Hub developer: Lauren Gallinaro (Interchain Berlin)\n\nWe feel the membership of the multisig should be rotated following the six-month pilot period to preserve insight from the distinct specializations (i.e., Cosmos Hub validators and developers).\n## Timeline and Deliverables\nWe estimate the total work to take 250-300 hours over six months where we hope to produce:\n* **Moving summaries:** Provide succinct summaries of the proposals and include all publicly stated reasons why various entities are choosing to vote for/against a given proposal. These summaries will be written objectively, not siding with any one entity.\n* **Validator platforms:** Create a section of the Forum where we collate all validators' visions for Cosmos Hub governance to allow them to state their positions publicly. We will work with the smaller validators to ensure they are equally represented.\n* **Regular check-ins with the Cosmonaut DAO:** Collaborate with the future Cosmonaut DAO to ensure maximal accessibility and engagement.

In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.\n\n# Discussion\n## Summary of existing definitions\nThis list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.\n\n1. **As a stronger No:** ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.\n2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.\n3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‚ÄòYes‚Äô supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.\n4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer‚Äôs deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).\n5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô provides an accountable ‚Äúin-protocol‚Äù method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.\n6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.\n\n## Censorship\nIt may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3 ‚ö†Ô∏è % of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2 ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è % of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.\n\n## Financial and social cost\n‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2 ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è % of the voting power. An overuse of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.\n\nConsequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô beyond representing a particularly strong ‚ÄòNo‚Äô vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‚ÄòNo‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô aside from reputational cost. \n\nWhile there is no financial cost to casting a ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô vote instead of ‚ÄòNo‚Äô, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn‚Äôt private, ‚ÄòYes‚Äô voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who‚Äôve revealed their ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.\n\n# Conclusion\nWe are proposing that ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô is not ‚Äúa stronger No‚Äù but neither is it a ‚Äúsignal for exit.‚Äù Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.\n\nCosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system.

This has been reflected in the engineering efforts by various core entities including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems as well as initial users Quicksilver and Neutron. ICS allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain.\nICS is a complex technology that needs to be rigorously tested. To ensure successful rollout, we are launching an incentivized public testnet where Cosmos Hub validators can participate and build confidence around this technology. Game of Chains will build on the Cosmos Hub‚Äôs legacy of running successful adversarial testnet programs in the past including  Game of Zones https://github.com/cosmosdevs/GameOfZones ‚ö†Ô∏è  and  Game of Stakes https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/ ‚ö†Ô∏è .\nWe believe the community will see ICS as a valuable addition to Cosmos Hub for three core reasons. First, it allows for ‚Äúhub minimalism.‚Äù By deploying features on a consumer chain instead of Cosmos Hub, we keep the hub lightweight and reduce the surface area for attacks and vulnerabilities. Second, Interchain Security lowers the barrier for ATOM aligned app chains to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Instead of arranging their own validator set, new app chains can utilize the Cosmos Hub‚Äôs existing validator for security. And lastly, Interchain Security accrues value to ATOM and enhances its utility. As new Interchain Secured zones launch, gas fees on these new chains flow back to ATOM stakers through the Hub‚Äôs validators.\n## Incentivized Testnet\nFor a successful launch, validators will need to prepare and train for expanding their node operations and governance efforts for every new Interchain Secured chain starting up. We are proposing an incentivized public testnet program that will serve the dual purposes of (1) testing Interchain Security in mainnet-like conditions and (2) providing Cosmos Hub validators the opportunity to build confidence around running the Interchain Security protocol.\nIn order to prevent delays and adequately prepare for launch, we believe it is critical for all Cosmos Hub validators to participate in this public testnet.

This has been reflected in the engineering efforts by various core entities including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems as well as initial users Quicksilver and Neutron. ICS allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain.\nICS is a complex technology that needs to be rigorously tested.

First, it allows for ‚Äúhub minimalism.‚Äù By deploying features on a consumer chain instead of Cosmos Hub, we keep the hub lightweight and reduce the surface area for attacks and vulnerabilities. Second, Interchain Security lowers the barrier for ATOM aligned app chains to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem.

Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWe believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.\n\nThis report will be delivered to you via this forum.

Our members are crypto-native companies and firms that provide industry-specific expertise (legal, consulting, marketing, etc.)\n\nFounded in France in 2020, Adan has over [195 members 6](https://adan.eu/en/association/members) in France and Europe across several industry verticals, including DeFi, payments, market making, custody, data analysis, and security, and is the largest crypto trade organization in Europe.\n\nAdan interacts with all stakeholders with interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.\n\nOur unique positioning allows us to rally decentralized DeFi actors and more traditional listed companies and corporations.\n\n- [Adan Website](https://adan.eu)\n- [Adan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adan_asso)\n- [Adan on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/adaneu/)\n\n### Mission\n\n- Educate about crypto and help create better narratives around this technology and industry\n- Foster an environment favorable to the growth of the industry\n- Accompany the implementation of French and European regulatory frameworks adapted to the specificities of the sector\n- Build constructive relations between the industry and public institutions\n\n### Team\n\n- Faustine Fleuret: President & CEO | [Twitter 8](https://twitter.com/faufleuret) / [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faustine-fleuret-640b67a4/)\n- M√©lodie Ambroise: Head of Strategy & Institutional Relations | [Twitter 3](https://twitter.com/mambroise23) / [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m%C3%A9lodie-ambroise/)\n- Jules Dubourg: Administrative & Financial Manager | [Twitter 1](https://twitter.com/Jules_Dubourg) / [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jules-dubourg/)\n- Hugo Bordet: Regulatory Affairs Manager | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HugoBordet1) / [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-bordet-598241152/)\n- Dorian Ravaute: Fiscal Affairs Officer |  [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorianravaute/)\n\n### Funding\n\nAdan is a membership organization and is funded primarily through annual fees.\n\nBeing aware that our missions concern not only the Cosmos community but the whole crypto ecosystem, we will ask for grants from other blockchains. Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.\n\nFinally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.\n\n### Governance\n\nMembers define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.\n\nSee our website for more information about Adan's governance and [Board of Directors 3](https://adan.eu/en/association/governance).\n\nAdan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).\n\n### Works & Publications\n\nAdan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.\n\nAdan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.\n\nIn just two short years, Adan has produced an astounding amount of writing and [publications](https://adan.eu/en/publications) to support its mission:\n\n- [A crypto-euro issued by an American giant, or how Europe is delegating its monetary sovereignty](https://adan.eu/en/tribune-les-echos-crypto-euro-en)\n- [EU framework for crypto-asset markets: the French Presidency ends with political deals on MiCA and TFR](https://adan.eu/en/press-release-policy-agreements-mica)\n- [Adan's Response to IOSCO's Retail Market Conduct Report](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/en/response-report-iosco-retail-market)\n- [Adoption of TFR in the European Parliament: the fight against financial crime should not be a fight against crypto-assets](https://adan.eu/en/press/tfr-travel-rule-vote-european-parliament-europeen-econ-libe)\n- [MiCA vote in the European Parliament: A step forward or backward for the crypto sector?](https://adan.eu/en/press-release/european-parliament-mica-compromise-crypto)\n- [Adan responds to the EBA consultation on its draft guidelines for remote onboarding customer solutions 1](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/response-guidelines-eba-onboarding-solutions)\n- [Ban of Proof-of-Work protocols: wrong answer to real global environmental challenges](https://adan.eu/en/position/pow-bitcoin-ban-eu-inappropriate-answer)\n- [Adan's position on FATF's updated guidance for a risk-based approach 1](https://adan.eu/en/position/fatf-updated-guidance-vasp)\n\n## Proposal details\n\nThe crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.\n\nTo this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:\n\n- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.\n- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.\n- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.\n- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).\n\nTo overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:\n\n- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda\n- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups\n- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)\n- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests\n\nGiven the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWe believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.\n\nThis report will be delivered to you via this forum. It will consist of different sections, such as :\n\n- actions carried out in the last months;\n- missions to be carried out in the coming months;\n- distribution of the remaining allocation.\n\n## Funding Amount\n\nTotal amount requested: 8,000 ATOM\n\nThis corresponds to roughly 100,000 EUR and covers gross salary, recruitment costs, and travel expenses for half a year.\n\n## Receipient\n\ncosmos1kdff80vxuj0zmmjauymzjs40hsfkuya79s8tm0\n\n## IPFS\n\nQmR1q2i48EJqaZSXxgggE8VaPKsZFtozVBPHKejMpJAYXx\n\n## Governance Discussion\n\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-adan-non-profit-fighting-for-sound-crypto-regulation/7416\n\n## Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n- YES - You agree that persuading regulators to adopt sound and proportional regulation is important and thus wish to fund Adan's work\n- NO - You don't agree that persuading regulators is important and thus do not agree to fund Adan's work\n- NO WITH VETO - A 'NoWithVeto' vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

Passing this proposal will transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to cyber Congress multisig (https://www.mintscan.io/account/cosmos1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqv2tkd9a).\n\nFull Proposal-Manifest text: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUYDQt9tqLQJwxnUck7dQY3XmZA3tDtpFh3Hchkg7oH46\n\nor at https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff\n\nThe software we offer resembles a decentralized google (https://github.com/cybercongress):\n- A protocol spec and the rationale behind it\n- go-cyber: our implementation using cosmos-sdk\n- cyber.page: PoC reference web interface\n- launch-kit: useful tools for launching cosmos-sdk based chains\n- cyberindex: GraphQL middleware for cyber\n- euler Foundation: mainnet predecessor of cyber Foundation: the DAO, which will handle all the donated ETH\n- documentation and various side tools\n\nCyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics core of the Internet. It does so by opening up access to evergrowing semantics core taught to it by the users.\n\nEconomics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.\n\nYou already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.\n\nWith the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.\n\nCosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.\n\nA good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn‚Äôt (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn‚Äôt solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (—Å) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).\n\nThe solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.\n\nThis means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.\n\nIf this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will open another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in Game of Links (https://cyber.page/gol/) or Takeoff https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff independently. If you have question you can ask them either on Cyber topic on Cosmos forum (https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cyber-a-decentralized-google-for-provable-and-relevant-answers) or Cyber forum (https://ai.cybercongress.ai).\n\nProposal results: https://www.mintscan.io/proposals/26",false],["CommunityPoolSpendProposal\n#52  -  üî¥\nATOM ü§ù Osmosis:  Allocate Community Pool to ATOM Liquidity Incentives\nVoting Start: Sun, 11 Jul 2021 21:10:26 UTC\nVoting End: Sun, 25 Jul 2021 21:10:26 UTC\nüëç 34.16%, üëé 63.21%, üïäÔ∏è 2.31%, ‚ùå 0.3% \\n\nATOMs should be the base money of Cosmos, just like ETH is the base money of the entire Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.

Allowing unsustainably low commission rates promotes spam and will not motivate validators to create innovative solutions for delegators, potentially stagnating the development of the Cosmos Network. \n\nHaving a 5% minimum commission ensures that validators are incentivized to innovate to acquire delegators.

Though the full implications are unclear, there is likely irreversible damage to Terra's user and developer base.\n\nThe Juno Network consists of a strong community of passionate users and developers, and like Terra shares the mindset that the true value of a network lies in the protocols and applications built upon it. This proposal is an endeavor to enable Terra developers to continue building and innovating. Furthermore, this aims to be a lifeline for their existing users to continue to benefit from these developers‚Äô platforms.\n\nSeveral Terra projects have reached out and expressed interest in migrating to and developing on Juno Network. It is expected that many more innovative projects and teams will follow with the passing of this proposal. \n\n## Background\n\nOn May 9th, 2022 the Terra chain appears to have suffered a financial attack that resulted in the insolvency of the network, and a crash in both UST and LUNA. \n\nThe combined market cap of LUNA/UST prior to the attack was in excess of 39.1 billion dollars. There are many hugely successful CosmWasm applications on Terra. These applications and protocols will need a home going forward. \n\nJuno, as a firmly established CosmWasm chain, can provide a platform and considerable community support for these developers to continue building their projects - a new home. \n\nThis will also benefit Juno by bringing in a wave of new users, developers and applications.\n\n## Proposed Use of Funds\n\nThe Community Fund contains roughly 16,248,583 JUNO, or approximately $75,880,883 in USD equivalent / ‚Ç¨72,845,647 in EUR equivalent at the time of writing.\n\nThis proposal would allocate a total of 1,000,000 JUNO (700,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool & 300,000 JUNO from the Juno Development Fund) to a Terra Developer Fund Multi-sig for project migration and continued development in the Juno ecosystem. It is worth approximately $4,670,000 in USD equivalent / ‚Ç¨4,483,647 EUR equivalent at the time of writing.\n\nVia governance, the funding could be further expanded with additional disbursements, if development accelerates, or returned back to the respective community and developer fund pools from the Multi-sig, if development wanes.

It is tightly integrated with Komple Framework releases. \n\n# Community-Centric Marketplace Builder \n\nOur community-centric marketplace builder allows for projects to build and configure their own marketplaces without needing to touch a single line of code. \n\nWe call this tool Marbu. \n\nMarbu allows DAOs, projects and individuals to shape their projects based on their custom needs. \n\nWith the use of modularity and contract interactions made possible by the Komple Framework, all projects within Marbu will have the ability to collaborate, scale up and put creativity first. \n\nWhile having the tools for such things, projects and Juno community will also benefit from the secondary sale fees - extracting the value they are bringing. \n\nSimply, Marbu aims to be the home of NFT based applications on Juno Network. \n\n# Project Timeline \n\nKomple is asking for a total of 320K USD from Juno community.

Many major DeFi protocols depend upon decentralized price feeds to function correctly. This is a rapid solution to provide that functionality.\\n- Currently, projects on Juno wanting to access price feeds have to pay excessive fees to access these feeds, which can be prohibitive for a start-up.\\n- Implementing a Price Oracle on Juno natively would give Juno (and the community) control over this public good.\\n- Even if better solutions come along, this is a rapidly implementable stop-gap solution that can be deployed. Future oracles and providers may improve upon this service.\\n- Juno would be the first *permissionless* CosmWasm chain with an on-chain Price Oracle, which is a valid differentiator for builders seeking to deploy DeFi protocols in a permissionless environment.\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n- Validators will have to run additional software to ensure the price oracle is decentralized.

The timing of this upgrade is crucial to properly execute the  Proposal 32 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32 ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  airdrop clawback. This clawback should happen right at the Airdrop end date of December 15th 5PM UTC, thus this upgrade must execute before it. \\n\\nThe upgrade block height `2383300` is estimated to be at December 14th, UTC 2:30PM. Block times have high variance, so please be monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \\n\\n## Upgrade features\\n\\nThis upgrade adds features such as:\\n\\n- Upgrade Cosmos-SDK to  SDK v0.44 https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3 ‚ö†Ô∏è  from SDK v0.42 For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see its  changelog https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21 ‚ö†Ô∏è . Noteable highlights include:\\n    -  Authz https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec ‚ö†Ô∏è  - Allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). \\n- New modules:\\n    -  Bech32IBC https://github.com/osmosis-labs/bech32-ibc ‚ö†Ô∏è  - Allows auto-routing of send msgs to addresses on other chains, once configured by governance. Allows you to do a bank send on Osmosis to a cosmos1... address, and it is automatically sent to the corresponding Cosmos Hub address over IBC. This is a big step in enabling more seemless IBC UX.\\n    -  TxFees https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees ‚ö†Ô∏è  - Enables validators to easily accept txfees in multiple assets, whitelisted by governance, by declaring minimum fees in OSMO.  Alternative fee assets are converted to their OSMO value, using the spot price on their primary OSMO base pair pool.  This upgrade pre-whitelists all the assets currently supported on the Osmosis frontend with an OSMO basepair pool.\\n- Implements  Proposal 32 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32 ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  - Clawback of unclaimed Osmo and Ion on airdrop end date. (December 15th, 5PM UTC)\\n- Upgrade IBC from a standalone module in the SDK to  IBC v2 https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è . This improves the utility of Ethereum Bridges and Cosmwasm bridges.\\n- Blocking  OFAC banned ETH addresses https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sanctions/1.0/sdn_advanced.xml ‚ö†Ô∏è  \\n- Numerous minor bug fixes, gas fixes, and significant speedups.\\n\\nSee more in the  changelog https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md\\n\\n## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Getting prepared for the upgrade\\n\\nAll nodes will require 32GB of memory. Swap can be used to achieve this, but getting nodes with 32GB RAM is _significantly_ preferred. Furthermore, NVMe SSDs significantly improve the speed of execution.\\n\\nPlease follow the setup instructions here for how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade:  Upgrade Guide https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.x/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v5/guide.md.\\n\\nNamely ‚ö†Ô∏è , configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you have to install cosmovisor from the SDK v0.42.9 branch) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd`  `v5.0.0` https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin/`.\\n\\nIf you do not want to use cosmovisor due to cosmovisor reliability issues, please be prepared to upgrade at around 2:30PM UTC, December 14th if this proposal passes.\\n\\n## Details of upgrade time\\n\\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the Osmosis blockchain will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v5.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\\n\\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `2383300`, anticipated to be at `Wednesday December 14th 2:30PM UTC (9:30AM EST)`.

The timing of this upgrade is crucial to properly execute the [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) airdrop clawback. This clawback should happen right at the Airdrop end date of December 15th 5PM UTC, thus this upgrade must execute before it. \\n\\nThe upgrade block height `2383300` is estimated to be at December 14th, UTC 2:30PM. Block times have high variance, so please be monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \\n\\n## Upgrade features\\n\\nThis upgrade adds features such as:\\n\\n- Upgrade Cosmos-SDK to [SDK v0.44](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) from SDK v0.42 For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see its [changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21). Noteable highlights include:\\n    - [Authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) - Allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). \\n- New modules:\\n    - [Bech32IBC](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/bech32-ibc) - Allows auto-routing of send msgs to addresses on other chains, once configured by governance. Allows you to do a bank send on Osmosis to a cosmos1... address, and it is automatically sent to the corresponding Cosmos Hub address over IBC. This is a big step in enabling more seemless IBC UX.\\n    - [TxFees](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees) - Enables validators to easily accept txfees in multiple assets, whitelisted by governance, by declaring minimum fees in OSMO.  Alternative fee assets are converted to their OSMO value, using the spot price on their primary OSMO base pair pool.  This upgrade pre-whitelists all the assets currently supported on the Osmosis frontend with an OSMO basepair pool.\\n- Implements [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) - Clawback of unclaimed Osmo and Ion on airdrop end date. (December 15th, 5PM UTC)\\n- Upgrade IBC from a standalone module in the SDK to [IBC v2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). This improves the utility of Ethereum Bridges and Cosmwasm bridges.\\n- Blocking [OFAC banned ETH addresses](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sanctions/1.0/sdn_advanced.xml) \\n- Numerous minor bug fixes, gas fixes, and significant speedups.\\n\\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\\n\\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\\n\\nAll nodes will require 32GB of memory. Swap can be used to achieve this, but getting nodes with 32GB RAM is _significantly_ preferred. Furthermore, NVMe SSDs significantly improve the speed of execution.\\n\\nPlease follow the setup instructions here for how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.x/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v5/guide.md).\\n\\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you have to install cosmovisor from the SDK v0.42.9 branch) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v5.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin/`.\\n\\nIf you do not want to use cosmovisor due to cosmovisor reliability issues, please be prepared to upgrade at around 2:30PM UTC, December 14th if this proposal passes.\\n\\n## Details of upgrade time\\n\\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the Osmosis blockchain will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v5.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\\n\\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `2383300`, anticipated to be at `Wednesday December 14th 2:30PM UTC (9:30AM EST)`.

Bug details at the end.\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal suggests doing an emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v6 binary. This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The  v6.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è  software version https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v6.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  is fully state-compatible with `v5.0.0` until the upgrade block `2464000`, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v3 upgrade (prop 17), used when the governance deposit mechanism was broken.\\\\n\\\\nThe proposed upgrade block height of 2464000 is estimated to be at December 20, 2021, 16:00 UTC (Monday).\\\\n\\\\nAll validators, and full node operators should update their software to version `v6.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è ` prior to block height 2464000. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\\\\n\\\\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\\\\n\\\\n## Actionable(s)\\\\n\\\\n* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è ` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è `, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è .\\\\n* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\\\\n* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\\\\n\\\\n## Failure case and risks involved\\\\n\\\\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - \"validators\" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis ‚ö†Ô∏è )\\\\n\\\\nNote: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\\\\n\\\\n## Governance procedure\\\\n\\\\n A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\\\\n A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\\\\n\\\\nDeposits are intended to be used by validators here.\\\\n\\\\n- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key. Please do this, even if your validator operator key is behind a multisig. This is a good time to take advantage of authz, to allow easier depositing & voting.\\\\n- Once over 66% of voting power has signalled readiness, this upgrade proposal is considered valid.\\\\n- Should this proposal fail to gather readiness signalling from two-thirds of voting power by December 20th 4AM UTC, the upgrade proposal should be considered failed and validators should revert to the old binary prior to block 2464000.\\\\n\\\\n## Testing methodology\\\\n\\\\nThis upgrade has been tested to be compatible with v5.0.0 until the upgrade height on a testnet. This was done by having a v6.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è  validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected). The v6.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è  node could then receive IBC transfers.\\\\n\\\\n## Bug Details\\\\n\\\\nRelevant issue:  osmosis-labs/osmosis #665 https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/665\\\\n\\\\nTL;DR ‚ö†Ô∏è  - There was a subtle misconfiguration in the Osmosis app.go ‚ö†Ô∏è .

After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\\\\n\\\\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\\\\n\\\\n## Actionable(s)\\\\n\\\\n* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0`, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0.\\\\n* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\\\\n* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\\\\n\\\\n## Failure case and risks involved\\\\n\\\\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - \"validators\" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis)\\\\n\\\\nNote: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\\\\n\\\\n## Governance procedure\\\\n\\\\n A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\\\\n A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\\\\n\\\\nDeposits are intended to be used by validators here.\\\\n\\\\n- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key.

This was done by having a v6.0.0 validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected). The v6.0.0 node could then receive IBC transfers.\\\\n\\\\n## Bug Details\\\\n\\\\nRelevant issue: [osmosis-labs/osmosis #665](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/665)\\\\n\\\\nTL;DR - There was a subtle misconfiguration in the Osmosis app.go.

1:1 Caps\nVoting Start: Thu, 27 Jan 2022 18:44:37 UTC\nVoting End: Sun, 30 Jan 2022 18:44:37 UTC\nüëç 51.96%, üëé 0.95%, üïäÔ∏è 46.94%, ‚ùå 0.14% \\n\nVoting YES for this proposal indicates that matching external incentives will no more than double the standard OSMO incentives for a pool and not be matched more than 1:1 in dollar value.\\n\\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that external incentives will continue to be over-matched according to the external incentive dollar value provided according the bias established in proposal 128 and only capped by the 30% global cap established in proposal 127. \\n\\n This proposal asks two questions of Osmosis governance and was combined as they are linked.\\n The external incentive program established in Proposal 47 has resulted in huge amounts of external tokens being distributed to Osmosis Liquidity Providers as rewards. However, the recent external incentives for STARS, HUAHUA and CMDX, as well as the proposed external ROWAN incentives in #132, have been substantially higher than previous ones. Matching these has resulted in a large amount of the daily Osmosis incentive distribution being used for matching purposes and has had proportionately reduced the APR across other pools without matching incentives.\\n A bias to external incentives has been confirmed in Proposal 128. This is not a simple weighting to provide non-Osmosis incentives 50% of the rewards that Osmosis pools do. Instead the weight of non-OSMO pools is decreased by 50% as well as the weight of OSMO pools being raised by 50%.\\n As a result of this, on the next semi-automatic incentives proposal, each  of external incentives on non-OSMO pools will not only be matched by bash.50 in OSMO rewards, but would also result in OSMO pools being matched by .50. (In both instances up to the 30% overall cap coming into effect). \\n\\n This proposal requests that the maximum match for  in external incentives is  in OSMO. \\n\\n These external incentives have also generated a lot of hype around high APRs, partially funded by Osmosis matching these high external incentives on new pools. This may have caused price increases of these tokens as liquidity providers seek to buy in to pools with higher APRs. In turn causing the price to further increase and therefore requiring even more OSMO to match the, now higher, dollar value of external incentives.\\n In order to ensure that the OSMO spent on matching these external incentives is useful for the ecosystem, this proposal requests that a cap on the dollar value of OSMO used for matching be added based on the fees generated by the pool.

My name is Anthony Rosa, and I am the project lead at Moultrie Audits. Centralized entities like Tether are holding firm to protect censorship resistance (https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1562468486886346753?s=20&t=R3Gc5J6rUnSfOzeYxNZyuw). There are many aspects to this conversation, and it is encouraged to read through the associated commonwealth threads (linked below) prior to voting. The blocked.go file prevents users from withdrawing to the contained blocked addresses, and the file comments state ‚Äúwe block all OFAC-blocked ETH addresses from receiving tokens.‚Äù If we accept as a community that we should censor addresses the government deems illegitimate, our entire purpose becomes questionable.\\n\\n # Reasons To Delete blocked.go\\n\\nWhy have a blockchain if the service retains the censorship restrictions of Web2? How can we claim to be decentralized while preventing users from accessing a service through a central repository subject to revision by the government? Why wouldn‚Äôt this set a censorship precedent?

(Columbus-5), hereinafter called ‚Äúlegacy Terra‚Äù, to re-enable IBC functionality to Osmosis and Juno.\n\nThe IBC channels 1, 20, and 49 (corresponding to Osmosis, Juno, and Crescent, respectively) were set to be ‚ÄúCLOSED‚Äù state as part of the v0.5.20 upgrade of Terra core software

liquidity pool (#617).\n - By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to the ATOM:CHEQ liquidity pool on Osmosis\n - By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to adding OSMO incentives to the ATOM:CHEQ liquidity pool on Osmosis.\n\n**Details**This is a signalling proposal to include the ATOM:CHEQ pair into the set of assets which receive OSMO liquidity incentives, which has been requested by the CHEQ community who are eager to provide liquidity.\n\nThe benefit to the Osmosis community from cheqd.io ‚ö†Ô∏è  is: The team are experts in digital identity, specifically self-sovereign identity (SSI) where the individual holds their own data, following the \"Hold your own keys\" mantra.

Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \\n\\n## Upgrade features\\n\\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\\n* Superfluid Staking\\n* Permissioned CosmWasm\\n* IAVL improvements (improved epoch times)\\n* UX improvements around LP bonding\\n\\nSee more in the  changelog https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v7.0.0/CHANGELOG.md\\n\\n## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Getting prepared for the upgrade\\n\\nAll nodes will require 64GB of memory. This must consist of a **minimum** of 32GB of RAM, while the remaining 32GB can be swap. For best results, use 64GB of physical memory.

A \"superfluid discount factor\" parameter exists for the superfluid module to ensure stability in the early rollout of superfluid staking, the superfluid discount factor parameter is set to 50% in this upgrade. This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.\\n\\nThe user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.\\n\\nHere is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:\\n\\n#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing\\n*Condition*\\n- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.\\n- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.\\n- Suppose you have designated validator \"Dogemosis\" as your superfluid validator.\\n- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%\\n\\n*Result*\\n- Your delegation to \"Dogemosis\" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.\\n- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.\\n- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ‚ö†Ô∏è  ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares. In essence, effective slashing rate increases to the lower the risk factor is set to.\\n\\n#### On Changes to the delegation amount depending on changes in spot price\\nLets now suppose the spot price in the pool changes during this epoch to be 1 ATOM = 1 OSMO, and your LP share changes to being `(75 OSMO, 75 ATOM)`. Upon the next epoch, the effective staked OSMO amount will be calculated as `75 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 67.5 ‚ö†Ô∏è  OSMO` to reflect the change in the underlying OSMO amount of the LP token.\\n\\nAs the amount of OSMO backing the LP share increased (hence increasing the effective superfluid staked amount), the staking rewards will also increase.\nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/osmosis/proposals/157",false],["# Osmosis Carbon Upgrade\\n\\nThis proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the [v7.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `3401000`, which is estimated to occur on February 28, UTC 8:00PM.

This spend is being requested early as the cost of a Carbon Credit has recently been lower than usual and so Osmosis will be able to purchase this liquidity at a reduced rate in preparation for a coordinated launch.\n\nBenefits to Osmosis\n The spend would be retained in the community pool as protocol owned liquidity and so no value should be lost from this proposal.\nSwap fees in this pool, at Osmosis average, would generate around $54,000 in revenue each year for the protocol.\n Retiring a portion of this revenue each year will ensure that Osmosis remains carbon neutral permanently.\n Through encouraging use of the Regen Network, the value of Osmosis protocol owned liquidity will increase to cater for projects yet to be connected via IBC. \n\nMethod\nThese funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of \n   Cory Levinson (Regen Network)\n   Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)\n    Nos Node (Osmosis Validator)\n\nThe $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase the NCT.\nThe NCT and any remaining $OSMO will then be returned to the multisig address on Osmosis.\n200 $OSMO will then be used to establish NCT/REGEN and a OSMO/NCT pool on Osmosis. These costs are paid into the community pool.\nAll of the $NCT will then be paired with $REGEN in a ratio to maintain the purchase price of $NCT.\nThe GAMM tokens for NCT/REGEN will then be returned, unbonded, to the Osmosis Community Pool, along with any remaining $OSMO tokens.\nAny remaining REGEN will be loaded as external incentives on the OSMO/NCT pool over a 90 day period, start time to be determined when NCT on Regen is fully live.\n\nDiscussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3936-proposal-osmosis-carbon-market-with-regen-network",false],["ParameterChangeProposal\n#183  -  üü¢\nIncrease Voting Period to 5 days\nVoting Start: Fri, 25 Mar 2022 16:24:55 UTC\nVoting End: Mon, 28 Mar 2022 16:24:55 UTC\nüëç 97.79%, üëé 1.94%, üïäÔ∏è 0.23%, ‚ùå 0.02% \\n\nVoting Yes to this proposal raises the governance parameter Voting_Period to five days./n/nVoting No to this proposal causes the governance parameter Voting_Period to remain at three days./n/nBackground/nThree day voting periods have enabled rapid change, something integral to the experimental spirit of Osmosis.

This proposal results from the community lobbying to submit a proposal to have incentives added to the pool to help develop liquidity. In addition, the community feels that the upcoming airdrop to OSMO stakers will help generate further liquidity in the pool by having incentives and incentivizing those who provide liquidity. After this proposal has passed governance, this CRBRUS pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.\n\n**Current External Incentives**\nCerberus stakers have already voted on a proposal for external incentives on pool #662.

Other partnerships are currently in the works to expand the use-case of Cerberus as a utility token on other networks.\n\nWebsite: https://cerberus.zone/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CerberusZone\nTelegram: https://t.me/cerberuszonegroup\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/u95WW9SKda\nMedium: https://medium.com/@cerberus_zone\n\n",false],["TextProposal\n#205  -  üü¢\nCanonical Ethereum Bridge Provider: Approval Voting Procedures & Reciprocal Expectations for Bridge Provision\nVoting Start: Wed, 20 Apr 2022 20:02:06 UTC\nVoting End: Mon, 25 Apr 2022 20:02:06 UTC\nüëç 99.37%, üëé 0.27%, üïäÔ∏è 0.33%, ‚ùå 0.01% \\n\nVoting YES to this Proposal means that you assent to using the following procedures to vote for a Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider (BSP) for app.osmosis.zone ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è , a relationship whose initial, mutable expectations are outlined below.\\n\\nVoting NO means you do not assent to these procedures and expectations. VETO and ABSTAIN have their normal functions.\\n\\nLIMITATION OF SCOPE: A YES vote assents to these procedures ONLY for the series of five Osmosis governance proposals outlined below. To guard against malicious or confusing proposals, only proposals made by osmo19mywfjzj324w5ukf7ss6jak0dg9hnljfp0rfx4 will be considered under these rules. Future use of these (or similar) procedures must be separately approved by governance.\\n\\nAPPROVAL VOTING PROCEDURES: Five Osmosis Governance Proposals will be proposed under these rules, one each for the four bridge service providers being voted upon: 1) Axelar, 2) Gravity Bridge, 3) Nomad, and 4) Wormhole, as well as 5) a ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù proposal.\\n\\nWINNER: The Bridge Service Provider (BSP) proposal (or ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù) from this set that receives the highest total amount of YES voting power at the end of the collective voting period will win, provided that QUORUM is reached and a RUN-OFF is not activated. That BSP will enter into a relationship with Osmosis DAO whose initial parameters are outlined below.\\n\\nNO, NO WITH VETO, and ABSTAIN votes will have NO EFFECT on the tally of yes voting power for the approval voting results. In other words, a bridge could win the approval vote even if it has more NO/VETO vote power than YES, as long as it has the most YES voting power among the BSP proposals.\\n\\nQUORUM: As long as the total YES voting power received across the 5 approval voting proposals is equivalent to regular Osmosis quorum (20% of total Osmosis voting power), quorum will be considered to have been reached.\\n\\nRUN-OFF: At the end of the collective voting period, any BSP or ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù proposal that has received within 15% of the leading proposal‚Äôs total will be entered into a run-off governed by these same rules and expectations, except that the run-off result will be final, with no further run-offs. This 15% will be measured as a percentage of the total voting power available on Osmosis for this set of proposals (NOT 15% of the top vote-getter‚Äôs YES voting power).\\nFor example, assuming 122M total staked OSMO available to vote, the 15% run-off spread is 18.3M. Therefore, if Bridge X gets 53M YES voting power, Bridge Y gets 35M, and Bridge Z gets 25M, Bridges X and Y will be entered into a run-off.\\n\\nBRIDGE SERVICE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP EXPECTATIONS:\\nThe Osmosis DAO is asking Osmosis Labs to integrate the BSP into app.osmosis.zone ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  to provide canonical, unprefixed bridged assets from Ethereum. The implementation details will be left to Osmosis Labs and the chosen BSP, but the general shape of the initial expectations is as follows. These expectations are subject to change as circumstance, future governance, and social consensus dictate.\\n\\nFrom Osmosis, the BSP can expect:\\nDefault Asset List ‚Äì the Ethereum assets bridged by the selected provider will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  default asset list ‚Äì i.e. their bridged ETH and ERC-20 assets will be ETH, USDC, etc., all other bridges' assets would be bridge1ETH, bridge2USDC, and the like. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions. In the near future, we expect custom token lists to become the norm in Cosmos, as they are on Ethereum, so that users can search for and import tokens that they want to interact with.\\nOsmosis Incentives ‚Äì the DAO commits to prioritizing the assets of the canonical bridge, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools‚Äìunder the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.\\nIntegration ‚Äì Osmosis expects to work closely with the BSP. At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).\\n\\nFrom the BSP, Osmosis can expect:\\nIntegration / Availability ‚Äì the BSP will help optimize integrations in a timely manner in accordance with Osmosis‚Äô stated goals of achieving deposits and withdrawals from the app.osmosis.zone ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è  UI and Keplr Wallet (without pass-through to the bridge UI).\\nLiquidity Mining Incentives ‚Äì if a project‚Äôs proposal included the promise of incentives (e.g. Axelar, at least 1% of Axelar tokens to be used for incentives on Osmosis).\\n\\nRevocability / At-will / Permissionless: As noted, these expectations are preliminary and subject to change as the DAO, developers, and the bridge team see fit. Osmosis DAO and the BSP will be working with each other for their mutual benefit, without contractual promise or obligation. It will be up to the BSP team to maintain a good relationship with Osmosis Labs regarding the front-end implementation details. Osmosis DAO empowers Osmosis Labs to change BSPs if in their estimation, the relationship has become unworkable, or the technical landscape suggests a superior solution, subject to ratification by the DAO.\\nShould the arrangement become unworkable for either party for whatever reason, the arrangement can be changed or terminated without notice. Any damages for bad behavior (broken promises, bridge failures) will be to reputation alone.

These incentives are crucial to help shift Osmosis liquidity away from Terra-based assets towards Ethereum-based stablecoins and major assets. However, these proposals are normal incentive adjustment proposals that go through the normal 5 day voting process (meaning they won't go into effect for 6 epochs).\\n \\n Because of the extremely volatile market conditions around Terra, we propose that we accelerate this process by using an 'emergency software upgrade' under special fast-voting rules to allow the incentives to shift faster than the normal 5 day voting period.\\n \\n The 'fast-voting process' would take the form of being enacted as soon as 2/3 of *total chain voting power* votes Yes on this proposal. At that time, if >2/3 of total voting power has voted Yes on each of #222, #223, and #224, then those proposals will be enabled during the upgrade process.  For example, if and once this proposal receives 66.6 ‚ö†Ô∏è % of voting power as Yes, if proposals #222 and #224 have >2/3 voting power, they would both be enacted during the upgrade process.\\n \\n The process of upgrade would involve a height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary, similar to the v6.0 upgrade. Validators/node operators can change the binary during v7 operations, if the fork is approved. The v8.0 software version will be fully state-compatible with *v8.0* until the divergence block.\\n \\n No upgrade timeline or software patch should be released until 67% of governance approval has voted yes on this proposal.

There is currently no governance adjustable parameter to implement this fee, so this proposal will be implemented in a subsequent software upgrade.\\n\\nFurther, to the extent that fees need to be priced via the Transaction Fee Module in another asset, the transaction fee module should be amended to utilize Osmosis Time Weighted Average Pricing over at least a 24 hour period instead of the currently utilized spot pricing to ensure that validators are fairly compensated no matter which asset is used for fees\\n\\nFull discussion on this proposal can be found here: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level)",false],["UnknownProposalType\n#355  -  üü¢\nUnknownTitle\nVoting Start: Fri, 04 Nov 2022 21:57:39 UTC\nVoting End: Wed, 09 Nov 2022 21:57:39 UTC\nüëç 99.22%, üëé 0.04%, üïäÔ∏è 0.7%, ‚ùå 0.02% \\n\nUnknownDescription\nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/osmosis/proposals/355",false],["UnknownDescription",false],["UnknownTitle\n\nUnknownDescription",false],["UpdatePoolIncentivesProposal\n#356  -  üü¢\nRegular Incentive adjustment for 2022-11-07\nVoting Start: Mon, 07 Nov 2022 15:24:12 UTC\nVoting End: Sat, 12 Nov 2022 15:24:12 UTC\nüëç 94.67%, üëé 0%, üïäÔ∏è 5.31%, ‚ùå 0% \\n\n\" Link to sheet displaying this proposal https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing\\n ‚ö†Ô∏è  Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing\\n ‚ö†Ô∏è  Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives ‚ö†Ô∏è \"\nhttps://wallet.keplr.app/chains/osmosis/proposals/356",false],["\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",false],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-11-07\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",false],["ClientUpdateProposal\n#357  -  üü¢\nUpdate IBC Client for Cerberus\nVoting Start: Tue, 08 Nov 2022 14:12:33 UTC\nVoting End: Sun, 13 Nov 2022 14:12:33 UTC\nüëç 86%, üëé 0.04%, üïäÔ∏è 13.95%, ‚ùå 0% \\n\nThe Cerberus chain spent 1.5 ‚ö†Ô∏è  weeks in halt due to the upcoming Dragonberry patch.

After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST.  IST liquidity will be incentivized through the Cosmos ecosystem, with Osmosis being a critical early destination.\\n\\n The authors believe that it would be in the best interests of the community to incentivize an OSMO-IST pool to drive deep eventual liquidity and easy access from any other Osmosis token \\n\\n Additionally, it is requested that IST be enabled and listed as an asset on app.osmosis.zone. The OSMO/IST pool should be listed as well in the main app.\\n\\n ## What is IST?\\n\\n IST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric‚Äôs unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric‚Äôs model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.\\n\\n For its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST.
