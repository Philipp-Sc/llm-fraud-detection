Don't Burn Deposits for Rejected Governance Proposals Unless Vetoed

The Cosmos Hub's state machine handles spam prevention of governance proposals by means of a deposit system. A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders’ time having to review the proposal).

In the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.

We instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If >33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors.  This proposal does not make any change to the current behavior for proposals that fail to meet quorum; if a proposal fails to meet quorum its deposit will be burned.

Notification for Security Critical Hard Fork at Block 482100

As described by user @Jessysaurusrex on Cosmos Forum in https://forum.cosmos.network/t/critical-cosmossdk-security-advisory/2211 ⚠️ , All in Bits has learned of a critical security vulnerability in the codebase for the Cosmos Hub.  We deem the issue to be of high severity, as if exploited it can potentially degrade the security model of the chain's Proof of Stake system.  This vulnerability CANNOT lead to the theft of Atoms or creation of Atoms out of thin air. 

 All in Bits has released a source code patch, Gaia v0.34.6, that closes the exploitable code path starting at block 482100. 

 The proposed upgrade code Git hash is:  80234baf91a15dd9a7df8dca38677b66b8d148c1 

 As a proof of stake, we are putting some collateral behind this legitimacy of this bug and patch and encourage others familiar with the report to do so as well.  If the disclosed bug turns out to be fabricated or malicious in some way, we urge the Cosmos Hub governance to slash these Atoms by voting NoWithVeto on this proposal. 

 We encourage validators and all users to upgrade their nodes to Gaia v0.34.6 before block 482100.  In the absence of another public bulletin board, we request validators to please vote Yes on this proposal AFTER they have upgraded their nodes to v0.34.6, as a method of signalling the readiness of the network for the upgrade.

Increase Max Validator Set Size to 125

Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRhQycV19QiTQGLuPzPHfJwCioj1wDeHHtZvxiHegTFDd ⚠️  

This proposal supercedes proposal number 9, which contains conflicting numbers in the title and body. 

In the Cosmos Hub, the total number of active validators is currently capped at 100, ordered by total delegated Atoms. This number was originally proposed in the Cosmos whitepaper section titled  Limitations on the Number of Validators https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#limitations-on-the-number-of-validators ⚠️  4. This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet.  

However, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of <7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set.  

In the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases. Future increases to the validator set size will be originated through governance.

Are Validators Charging 0% Commission Harmful to the Success of the Cosmos Hub?

This governance proposal is intended to act purely as a signalling proposal.  Throughout this history of the Cosmos Hub, there has been much debate about the impact that validators charging 0% commission has on the Cosmos Hub, particularly with respect to the decentralization of the Cosmos Hub and the sustainability for validator operations. 

 Discussion around this topic has taken place in many places including numerous threads on the Cosmos Forum, public Telegram channels, and in-person meetups.  Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. 

 There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission.  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 ⚠️  

 This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum.  It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. 

 We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here:  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 ⚠️  

 Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. 

 The question on this proposal is “Are validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?”.  A Yes vote is stating that they ARE harmful to the network's success, and a No vote is a statement that they are NOT harmful.

https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/rc1/v0.36.0/CHANGELOG.md

-=-=-

If approved, and assuming that testing is successful, there will be a second proposal called Cosmos Hub 3 Upgrade Proposal B. Cosmos Hub 3 Upgrade Proposal B should specify 1) the software hash; 2) the block height state export from cosmoshub-2; 3) the genesis time; 4) instructions for generating the new genesis file.

We are proposing to use this code https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v2.0.0 ⚠️  to upgrade the Cosmos Hub. We are proposing to export the ledger’s state at Block Height 1,933,000, which we expect to occur on September 24, 2019 at or around 1:53 pm UTC. Please note that there will likely be a variance from this target time, due to changes in block time (https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-hub-3-upgrade-proposal-d/2675/18?u=gavin ⚠️ ). We are proposing to launch Cosmos Hub 3 at 60 minutes after Block Height 1,933,000.

Full proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSMGEoY2dfxADPfgoAsJxjjC6hwpSNx1dXAqePiCEMCbY ⚠️ 

-=-=-

Amount to spend from the community pool: 5250 ATOMs

Timeline: Q1 2020

Deliverables:
1. A governance working group community & charter
2. A template for community spend proposals
3. A best-practices document for community spend proposals
4. An educational wiki for the Cosmos Hub parameters
5. A best-practices document for parameter changes
6. Monthly governance working group community calls (three)
7. Monthly GWG articles (three)
8. One Q2 2020 GWG recommendations article

Milestones:
By end of Month 1, the Cosmos Governance Working Group (GWG) should have been initiated and led by Gavin Birch of Figment Networks.
By end of Month 2, Gavin Birch is to have initiated and led GWG’s education, best practices, and Q2 recommendations.
By end of Month 3, Gavin Birch is to have led and published initial governance education, best practices, and Q2 recommendations.

Detailed milestones and funding:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFEvMSLbiHoVAYqBq8lo3qQw3KtPMEqDFz47ESf6HEg/edit?usp=sharing ⚠️ 

Beyond the milestones, Gavin will lead the GWG to engage in and answer governance-related questions on the Cosmos Discourse forum, Twitter, the private Cosmos VIP Telegram channel, and the Cosmos subreddit. The GWG will engage with stake-holders to lower the barriers to governance participation with the aim of empowering the Cosmos Hub’s stakeholders. The GWG will use this engagement to guide recommendations for future GWG planning.

Read more about the our efforts to launch the Cosmos GWG here: https://figment.network ⚠️ /resources/introducing-the-cosmos-governance-working-group/

-=-=-

_Problem_
Perhaps the most difficult barrier to effective governance is that it demands one of our most valuable and scarce resources: our attention. Stakeholders may be disadvantaged by informational or resource-based asymmetries, while other entities may exploit these same asymmetries to capture value controlled by the Cosmos Hub’s governance mechanisms.

We’re concerned that without establishing community standards, processes, and driving decentralized delegator-based participation, the Cosmos Hub governance mechanism could be co-opted by a centralized power. As governance functionality develops, potential participants will need to understand how to assess proposals by knowing what to pay attention to.

_Solution_
We’re forming a focused, diverse group that’s capable of assessing and synthesizing the key parts of a proposal so that the voting community can get a fair summary of what they need to know before voting.

Our solution is to initiate a Cosmos governance working group that develops decentralized community governance efforts alongside the Hub’s development. We will develop and document governance features and practices, and then communicate these to the broader Cosmos community.

_Future_
At the end of Q1, we’ll publish recommendations for the future of the Cosmos GWG, and ideally we’ll be prepared to submit a proposal based upon those recommendations for Q2 2020. We plan to continue our work in blockchain governance, regardless of whether the Hub passes our proposals.

CosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades

Community-spend proposal submitted by Ethan Frey (https://github.com/ethanfrey ⚠️ ) of Confio UO (http://confio.tech/ ⚠️ ) and CosmWasm (https://www.cosmwasm.com ⚠️  ⚠️ )

-=-=-

Full proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC ⚠️  ⚠️ 
Forum Post: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-cosmwasm-on-cosmos-hub/3629 ⚠️ 

-=-=-

Amount to spend from the community pool: 25000 ATOMs

Timeline: 2-4 months from approval

Deliverables:
1. Adding governance control to all aspects of the CosmWasm contract lifecycle to make it compatible with the hub. Allowing governance to control code upload, contract instantiation, upgrades, and destruction (if needed).
2. Adding ability to upgrade contracts along with migrations (also allowing orderly shutdowns). This controlled by a governance vote.
3. Launch a testnet with working version of this code (Cosmos SDK 0.38 ⚠️  or 0.39 ⚠️ ) to enable all interested parties to trial the process and provide feedback.
4. Provide sample contracts to demo on the testnet, along with some migration scenarios

Within 2 months, the working code and binaries should be delivered and open for public review. Within 4 months, these binaries will be used on a testnet, with sufficient staking tokens given to all active voters on the Cosmos Hub, and we will go through a few governance voting cycles to trial contract deployment and migrations (with a shorter voting cycles, eg. 3 days)

Detailed milestones in the full proposal:
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC ⚠️  ⚠️ 

Beyond the milestones, CosmWasm will enhance documentation of the platform and offer technical support on our Telegram channel.

_Problem_
With the upcoming launch of IBC, the hub will need to adapt more rapidly to the needs of the ecosystem, while also limiting chain restarts, which may be detrimental to IBC connections. In particular support for relaying Dynamic IBC Protocols and Rented Security, using ATOMs as collateral for smaller zones, would greatly benefit from CosmWasm's flexibility.

_Solution_
We’re adding some key features to CosmWasm to convert it from a permissionless, immutable smart contract platform to a permissioned platform with governance control for upgrading or shutting down contracts. This is a key requirement to be able to integrate CosmWasm to the Cosmos Hub with minimal disruption.

_Future_
We will continue development of CosmWasm, especially adding IBC integration as well as working towards a stable 1.0 ⚠️  release that can be audited and safely deployed (Q3/Q4 2020).

"CosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades

Community-spend proposal submitted by Ethan Frey (https://github.com/ethanfrey) of Confio UO (http://confio.tech/) and CosmWasm (https://www.cosmwasm.com)

-=-=-

Full proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC
Forum Post: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-cosmwasm-on-cosmos-hub/3629

-=-=-

Amount to spend from the community pool: 25000 ATOMs

Timeline: 2-4 months from approval

Deliverables:
1. Adding governance control to all aspects of the CosmWasm contract lifecycle to make it compatible with the hub. Allowing governance to control code upload, contract instantiation, upgrades, and destruction (if needed).
2. Adding ability to upgrade contracts along with migrations (also allowing orderly shutdowns). This controlled by a governance vote.
3. Launch a testnet with working version of this code (Cosmos SDK 0.38 or 0.39) to enable all interested parties to trial the process and provide feedback.
4. Provide sample contracts to demo on the testnet, along with some migration scenarios

Within 2 months, the working code and binaries should be delivered and open for public review. Within 4 months, these binaries will be used on a testnet, with sufficient staking tokens given to all active voters on the Cosmos Hub, and we will go through a few governance voting cycles to trial contract deployment and migrations (with a shorter voting cycles, eg. 3 days)

Detailed milestones in the full proposal:

Stargate is our name for the process of ensuring that the widely integrated public network known as the Cosmos Hub is able to execute the cosmoshub-3 -> cosmoshub-4 upgrade with the minimum disruption to its existing ecosystem. This upgrade will also realize the Internet of Blockchains vision from the Cosmos whitepaper.
Integrations from ecosystem partners are at risk of breaking changes due to the Stargate changes. These changes drive the need for substantial resource and time requirements to ensure successful migration. Stargate represents a unique set of circumstances and is not intended to set precedent for future upgrades which are expected to be less dramatic.
There is a widespread consensus from many Cosmos stakeholders that these changes to core software components will enhance the performance and composability of the software and the value of the Cosmos Hub in a world of many blockchains.
A Yes result on this proposal provides a clear signal that the Cosmos Hub accepts and understands the Stargate process and is prepared to approve an upgrade with proposed changes if the plan below is executed successfully.
A No result would force a reconsideration of the tradeoffs in the Alternatives section and the forming a new plan to deliver IBC.

While the current inflation rate is set at 7%, the effective inflation rate is more like ~6.29 ⚠️ %.

Governance Split Votes

In the Cosmos Hub governance system, each address can only cast a vote for one option (Yes/No/Abstain/NoWithVeto) which uses their full voting power behind that choice.

This proposal proposes an upgrade to the Cosmos Hub governance module that would allow a staker to optionally split their votes into several voting options. For example, a single address could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No. Clients may opt into supporting this feature, as the existing UX of voting for a single option is preserved.

This is beneficial because oftentimes the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company or organization that owns an address might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power.

Another example use case is exchanges and custodians. Many custodians and exchanges custody multiple customers’ ATOMs in the same address and use this address to stake on behalf of them. However, because of this, it makes it infeasible to do 'passthrough voting' and give their customers voting rights over their tokens, if different customers have different voting preferences. With this new proposal, custodians can use split votes to accurately reflect the preferences of their customers in on-chain governance.

The technical architecture for this feature can be seen in ADR 037 to the Cosmos SDK: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-037-gov-split-vote.md ⚠️  

Acceptance of this governance proposal is signalling approval to adopt this feature in a future upgrade of the Cosmos Hub.

Delay of Hub Stargate Upgrade for approximately 2 weeks

The Stargate team is recommending that the Cosmos Hub reschedule the next upgrade to a new commit hash. The new commit hash is expected to be available on Tuesday Jan 26th with a new upgrade proposal immediately after.

This governance proposal will signal that  proposal 35 https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/35 ⚠️  will not be executed. The Hub governance will vote on the forthcoming proposal aiming for a final upgrade. The earliest target date would be February 11th. Given that Lunar New Year is on Feb 12th. The next best date is Feb 18th 06:00UTC.

We are recommending the delay for the following reasons.

* Bugs have been identified in the Proposal 29 implementation.  They are resolved in this pull request Additional review of prop 29 and migration testing by zmanian · Pull Request #559 · cosmos/gaia · GitHub https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/559 ⚠️ 
* A balance validation regression was identified during Prop 29 code review.  x/bank: balance and metadata validation by fedekunze · Pull Request #8417 · cosmos/cosmos-sdk · GitHub https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8417 ⚠️ 
* The IBC Go To Market Working Group has  identified Ledger hardware wallet https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/8266 ⚠️  support as a necessary feature for the initial launch of IBC on the Hub. We have an opportunity to provide this support in this upgrade. The SDK believes this can be quickly remediated in the time available with merged PRs on Monday.
* The number of Stargate related support requests from integrators has increased significantly since the governance proposal went live but some teams have already announced a period of reduced $ATOM support while they upgrade like <https://twitter.com/Ledger_Support/status/1352247403605356551?s=20 ⚠️ >. The additional time should minimize the disruption for $ATOM holders. Thank so much to the $IRIS team whom is fielding a similar request volume among our non-English community.

Enable IBC transfers

👍 99.99%, 👎 0%, 🕊️ 0%, ❌ 0% \n
The Proposal enables transferring and receiving assets using the ICS20 standard on the Cosmos Hub. If this proposal passes, there will be IBC assets available in the Bank module of the Hub and ATOM will be available on Zones connected over IBC.
 Iqlusion believes that the IBC software is sufficiently stable for small amounts of value transfer. We expect there to be issues with stuck funds and UX confusion but overcoming these issues will only happen once IBC is live.
 Security Model
 Tendermint full nodes produce agreement under the assumption that at most ⅓ of the voting power held by validators is Byzantine.
 IBC
IBC is a protocol for authenticated message passing between heterogeneous sovereign blockchains. IBC requires trusting that chains on both sides of the connections operate within their security model.
 Incentive Security Extensions
 IBC has a facility to support freezing connections once a violation of the security model has occurred. The set of criteria for detecting such attacks continues to evolve and is a constant focus of research.

Inflation Rate Change Correction

The purpose of changing the network’s inflation rate is to protect it from unbonding shocks that threaten to compromise the security of the network. When the bonded ratio gets below the goal bonded ratio (currently at 66% on the hub) the inflation rate & effective yield of staked atoms goes up in order to incentivize holders to bond new ATOM’s, providing additional security to the network. Inversely, if we regain a desired amount of staked tokens, the yield will drop, decreasing effective yields for all delegators. Ideally the inflation rate starts changing fast, optimizing network security over monetary hardness. To figure out what an appropriate selection for the cosmos hub would be, I created excel sheets to run through all the different scenarios to find what value made the inflation rate react in an optimal manner. I came to the conclusion that 1 (AKA 100% per year is the maximum slope of the inflation curve) gave the most ideal characteristics, with the added benefit of simplifying the equation. I’ll give some examples on how it would react. Since unbonding is what we are protecting against, I will look at flash unbonds while the inflation rate is at the floor due to that being the #1 time of vulnerability.

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt the Gravity DEX protocol on the Cosmos Hub. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding the Gravity DEX protocol on the Cosmos Hub.\n\n### Background\n\nIn July 2020, the Iqlusion team developed ATOM 2021 to drive the direction of the Cosmos Hub after the completion of the Cosmos whitepaper and IBC. It became clear that providing liquidity to new IBC connected zones was core the Hub's mission. \n\nTendermint ( https://tendermint.com ⚠️  https://tendermint.com ⚠️ /) and B-Harvest ( https://bharvest.io ⚠️  https://bharvest.io ⚠️ /)  joined forces to produce and develop a Liquidity Module ( https://github.com/tendermint/liquidity ⚠️ ). In 2021 March, they submitted a signal governance proposal to ask the Atom delegator community about Gravity DEX (Liquidity Module) adoption on the Cosmos Hub. Prop38 was very well approved by the community ( https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/38 ⚠️ ).\n\nThis proposal completes the first leg of ATOM 2021 and achieves the goals of the signaling proposal by bringing an IBC compatible DEX to the Hub.\n\n### Ready for Production\n\nWith continuous quality improvement of the codebase, very wide test coverage, a codebase audit from Least Authority and Simply VC, and subsequent follow-up codebase strengthening, along with extensive simulation processes, we are now very confident to be ready for production utilization of the Gravity DEX (Liquidity Module) on the Cosmos Hub. The Gaia branch for the new release with Gravity DEX feature can be found  here https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v5.0.0 ⚠️ ). Please also check out the  github repository https://github.com/b-harvest/gravity-dex-upgrade-test ⚠️  for the launch testing of Gaia with Gravity DEX.\n\n### On-Chain Upgrade Process\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. And then, all validators and node operators have to substitute the existing state machine binary to the new binary with the Gravity DEX feature. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\n\n### Potential Risk Factors\n\nAlthough Tendermint executed very extensive testing and simulation, and conducted in-depth audits, and followed up with the corresponding codebase improvement, there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new Gravity DEX feature. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately, and use the fixed state machine program provided by Tendermint.

⚛️  Add IBC Router to Hub ⚛️

The Hub has long been envisioned as a central point in the IBC architecture. In the battle to build and ship IBC this central vision has remained unchanged, but with so much focus on the need to build out other zones with real economies to support this network (the CosmosSDK is the result of this effort), the idea of the hub as an Interchain Router hasn't been discussed in a serious context for quite a while.

This is understandable: Cosmos needed so many other pieces to come together before the Hub had a chance to even start performing this function. Those other zones have been created, they each have products and economies. The bootstrapping era of IBC is well underway.

These new zones joining are noticing a problem: they need to maintain a large amount of infrastructure (archive nodes and relayers for each counterparty chain) to connect with all the chains in the ecosystem, a number that is continuing to increase quickly.

Luckly this problem has been anticipated and IBC architected to accomodate multi-hop transactions. However, a packet forwarding/routing feature was not in the initial IBC release. This proposal aims to fix this for the Hub.

This is a proposal to include a new feature to IBC on the Hub that allows for multi-hop packet routing for ICS20 transfers. By appending an intermediate address, and the port/channel identifiers for the final destination, clients will be able to outline more than one transfer at a time.

Strangelove Ventures has delivered an  IBC Middleware module https: //github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/373 that will allow the hub to play the role of IBC Router that was always envisioned for it. Passing of this propsal will begin the era of the Hub offering interchain services to other chains and profiting from those relationships.

To pay the hub validators and stakers, this proposal implements a governance configurable fee (which we propose should be initially set to 0.0 ⚠️  to encourage adoption) that will be taken out of each packet and given to the community pool. The community pool will then periodically trade these fees for ATOM and distribute them to staked holders. The exact distribution method of these fees is left TBD in this proposal as it is not initially required and can be implemented in a future governance proposal. One way to do this would be using the  Groups module https: //docs.cosmos.network/master/architecture/adr-042-group-module.html, Community spend proposals and the Gravity DEX.

A vote YES on this proposal indicates that this feature should be included in the next hub upgrade. We (as the Hub) believe that time is critical right now and we cannot wait to begin providing this service to other chains. A NO vote indicates that this shouldn't be included in the next upgrade.

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt gaia v6.0.0 which includes a number of updates, fixes and new modules. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.

### Background

Since the last upgrade at height 6910000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint. The following updates are included in gaia v6.0.0:
 * Bump  Cosmos-SDK https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️  to  v0.44.3 https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /releases/tag/v0.44.3 which notably includes fixes for the vesting accounts and two new modules outlined below. For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see the  CHANGELOG.md ⚠️  ⚠️  https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md ⚠️  ⚠️ #v0443---2021-10-21
     * Add the  authz https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec module to the Cosmos Hub. `x/authz` is an implementation of a Cosmos SDK module, per  ADR 30 https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /blob/v0.44.3/docs/architecture/adr-030-authz-module.md, that allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). Authorizations must be granted for a particular Msg service method one by one using an implementation of the `Authorization` interface.
     * Add the  feegrant https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /tree/v0.44.3/x/feegrant/spec module to the Cosmos Hub. This module allows accounts to grant fee allowances and to use fees from their accounts. Grantees can execute any transaction without the need to maintain sufficient fees.
     * **NOTICE** It's imortant to highlight  PR #10041 https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /pull/10041 which impacts **WALLETS AND EXCHANGES**.

These changes have been extensively tested by various Cosmos Core Contributor teams including  Hypha Co-Op https://hypha.coop/ ⚠️ ,  Informal Systems Co-Op https://informal.systems/ ⚠️ ,  Interchain GmbH https://interchain.berlin/ ⚠️ ,  Regen Network https://regen.network/ ⚠️ ,  Strangelove Ventures https://strangelove.ventures/ ⚠️ ,  Tendermint Inc https://tendermint.com/ ⚠️  and more. The release candidate for this update was run as a local testnet and a public testnet with a successful upgrade; documentation can be found  here https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test ⚠️ .

### On-Chain Upgrade Process

When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on  Cosmovisor https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /tree/master/cosmovisor to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Instructions specific to the upgrade can be found  here https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/gaia-tutorials/upgrade-node.md ⚠️ . To test a simulated local upgrade please see the  local testnet documentation https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test ⚠️ /blob/master/local-testnet/README.md. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.

"This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt gaia v6.0.0 which includes a number of updates, fixes and new modules. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.

### Background

Since the last upgrade at height 6910000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint. The following updates are included in gaia v6.0.0:
 * Bump [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.44.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) which notably includes fixes for the vesting accounts and two new modules outlined below. For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21)
     * Add the [authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. `x/authz` is an implementation of a Cosmos SDK module, per [ADR 30](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.3/docs/architecture/adr-030-authz-module.md), that allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). Authorizations must be granted for a particular Msg service method one by one using an implementation of the `Authorization` interface.
     * Add the [feegrant](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/feegrant/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. This module allows accounts to grant fee allowances and to use fees from their accounts. Grantees can execute any transaction without the need to maintain sufficient fees.

## Summary
Proposal to request for 1000 ATOM from the community spending pool to be sent to a multisig who will put funds towards stewardship of the Discourse forum to make it an authoritative record of governance decisions as well as a vibrant space to draft and discuss proposals.
## Details
We are requesting 1000 ATOM from the community spending pool to activate and steward the Cosmos Hub (Discourse) forum for the next six months.

Off-chain governance conversations are currently highly fragmented, with no shared public venue for discussing proposals as they proceed through the process of being drafted and voted on. It means there is no record of discussion that voters can confidently point to for context, potentially leading to governance decisions becoming delegitimized by stakeholders.

The requested amount will be sent to a multisig comprising individuals (members listed below) who can ensure that the tokens are spent judiciously. We believe stewardship of the forum requires:

* **Moderation**: Format, edit, and categorize posts; Standardize titles and tags; Monitor and approve new posts; Archive posts.
* **Facilitation**: Ask clarifying questions in post threads; Summarize discussions; Provide historical precedence to discussions.
* **Engagement**: Circulate important posts on other social channels to increase community participation; Solicit input from key stakeholders.
* **Guidance**: Orient and assist newcomers; Guide proposers through governance process; Answer questions regarding the forum or Cosmos ecosystem.
The work to steward the forum will be carried out by members of  Hypha Worker Co-op https://hypha.coop/ ⚠️  and individuals selected from the community to carry out scoped tasks in exchange for ATOM from this budget.
## Multisig Members
* Hypha: Mai Ishikawa Sutton (Hypha Co-op)
* Validator: Daniel Hwang (Stakefish)
* Cosmos Hub developer: Lauren Gallinaro (Interchain Berlin)

We feel the membership of the multisig should be rotated following the six-month pilot period to preserve insight from the distinct specializations (i.e., Cosmos Hub validators and developers).
## Timeline and Deliverables
We estimate the total work to take 250-300 hours over six months where we hope to produce:
* **Moving summaries:** Provide succinct summaries of the proposals and include all publicly stated reasons why various entities are choosing to vote for/against a given proposal. These summaries will be written objectively, not siding with any one entity.
* **Validator platforms:** Create a section of the Forum where we collate all validators' visions for Cosmos Hub governance to allow them to state their positions publicly. We will work with the smaller validators to ensure they are equally represented.
* **Regular check-ins with the Cosmonaut DAO:** Collaborate with the future Cosmonaut DAO to ensure maximal accessibility and engagement. Community management is a critical, complementary aspect of increasing participation in governance.
* **Announcement channel:** Create a read-only announcement channel in the Cosmos Community Discord, so that new proposals and major discussions can be easily followed.
* **Tooling friendly posts:** Tag and categorize posts so that they can be easily ingested into existing tooling that validators have setup.
* **Neutral moderation framework:** Document and follow transparent standards for how the forum is moderated.

At the end of the period, we will produce a report reflecting on our successes and failures, and recommendations for how the work of maintaining a governance venue can be continuously sustained (e.g., through a DAO). We see this initiative as a process of discovery, where we are learning by doing.

For more context, you can read through the discussions on this  proposal on the Discourse forum https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-activate-governance-discussions-on-the-discourse-forum-using-community-pool-funds/5833 ⚠️ .

## Governance Votes
The following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:
**YES** - You approve this community spend proposal to deposit 1000 ATOM to a multisig that will spend them to improve governance discussions in the Discourse forum.
**NO** - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form (please indicate why in the Cosmos Forum).

Update expired client between Cosmoshub and Bostrom

This proposal will update the expired client on channel-240 between cosmoshub-4 and the bostrom networks. In turn, this will let users transfer  from bostrom, and to transfer  from cosmoshub back to bostrom.\n\nBy voting **YES**, the Cosmoshub stakers, voice their support to unfreeze IBC channel-240 between Cosmoshub and Bostrom.\n\nBy voting **NO**, the Cosmoshub stakers voice their dissent to unfreeze IBC channel-240 between Cosmoshub and Bostrom network.\n\n**Details:**\n\nMost IBC connections between Bostrom and other Cosmos chains have been relayed, to a large extent, only by the Bro_n_Bro validator.\n\nOriginally, channel-240 was created with a very short trusting period of 2 days.

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt gaia v7.0.0 which includes a number of updates and fixes. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these 

For instructions on performing the upgrade see https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/upgrade-node.html ⚠️  ⚠️ 

# Background

Since the last v6-Vega upgrade at height 86950000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint.

This is a proposal to adopt the first release for the  v7-Theta https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.md#v7-theta-upgrade-expected-q2-2022 ⚠️  upgrade the `cosmoshub-4` mainnet.

It contains the following changes:

- (gaia) bump  cosmos-sdk https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️  to  v0.45.1 https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /releases/tag/v0.45.1. See  CHANGELOG.md ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk ⚠️ /blob/v0.45.1/CHANGELOG.md ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ #v0451---2022-02-03 for details.
- (gaia) bump  ibc-go https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go ⚠️  module to  v3.0.0 https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go ⚠️ /releases/tag/v3.0.0. See  CHANGELOG.md ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go ⚠️ /blob/v3.0.0/CHANGELOG.md ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ #v300---2022-03-15 for details.
- (gaia) add  interhcian account https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go ⚠️ /tree/main/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts module (interhchain-account module is part of ibc-go module).
- (gaia) bump  liquidity github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity/x/liquidity ⚠️  module to  v1.5.0 https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.5.0 ⚠️ . See  CHANGELOG.md ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/blob/v1.5.0/CHANGELOG.md ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ #v150---20220223 for details.
- (gaia) bump  packet-forward-middleware https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware ⚠️  module to  v2.1.1 https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware ⚠️ /releases/tag/v2.1.1.
- (gaia) add migration logs for upgrade process.

# On-Chain Upgrade Process
When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on Cosmovisor to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. To test a simulated local upgrade please see the local testnet documentation. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.

For full instructions please see https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/upgrade-node.html ⚠️  ⚠️ 
### Potential Risk Factors

Although very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the  Cosmos Developer Discord https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork ⚠️  to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v6.0.x).

Upon passing of this proposal, only withdrawal of assets from LP will be available on Gravity DEX operating on Cosmos Hub. Other activities such as swap and deposit will be disabled. 
 We advise former Gravity DEX users to withdraw coins from LP and return assets to each original chain. Withdrawal of LP from Gravity DEX is also available on Crescent. The IBC relayer service from Cosmos Hub to other chains will be provided by Crescent Team until the end of June, so there might be no operating IBC relayers after end of June.

Make Cosmos Hub the Lead Sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022

Summary:
If this proposal passes, 2600 ATOM will be allocated to the Cosmoverse team - making the ATOM community the lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022. The Cosmos Hub was the first lead supporter for Cosmoverse 2021 and we would like to keep it that way for this one as well. Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world.

Description:
Cosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 27 & 28, 2022.

Our goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.

Cosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

Where do the funds go?

The sponsorship will help us finance the Cosmoverse conference. 

The main costs include:

Conference venue
F&B (conference + afterparty)
Marketing leading up to the event
Audio and visuals
Official afterparty
Legal costs
How does it benefit the ATOM community?

By allocating 2600 ATOM from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, the Cosmos Hub will become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.

Keynote speech: If this proposal passes, we offer three keynote slots to core Cosmos contributors. We will keep you updated on this topic on the official Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website.

Logo placement: The ATOM logo will be shown as “lead sponsor” on the main conference days. We will make sure everyone at the conference knows that the ATOM community has significantly contributed to covering the conference’s costs and making this a great event.

General Admission Tickets: We will give 15 general admission tickets to the ATOM community. Distribution TBD.

Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.

Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

Event Highlights 2021 and What To Expect

Cosmoverse 2021 took place in Lisbon, Portugal. The conference brought the Cosmos community together and kick-started new developments in the interchain! The attendees were provided with food, beverages, and merchandise and were able to listen to keynotes/ panels that were held by Cosmos thought leaders. Cosmoverse is the most community-driven Cosmos conference in the world! It is organized by and for Cosmonauts. 

This means low ticket prices and no VIP areas. If you attend the conference, you have direct access to all speakers and can ask them questions. 

Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia, and will have the same community vibe - but it will be much bigger! 

There will be many Cosmos speakers at the event, two coffee breaks per day including an assortment of food, two 5-star buffet lunches, an NFT room, a public co-working zone, private meeting rooms for sponsors and their teams, and much, much more. We will be able to provide twice as many tickets as the first conference. Medellin is a vibrant city settled in between a beautiful valley in the heart of Colombia. With many activities besides the ones we will be hosting throughout the week. We will ensure that within the Cosmoverse week, attendees will have the possibility to visit side events and meet Cosmonauts from all over the world!

The Team:

Cryptocito: Cryptocito is the most prominent Cosmos YouTuber in the interchain! Who is responsible for bringing all the cosmos together, through outreach, and planning of the event.

Basil Naser: Basil is part of the Cryptocito team. Last year he founded the Cosmoverse conference with Crypotcito. He is responsible for event operations and branding.

Fabian Klauder: Fabian is the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES, a Cosmos-focused media company. He is responsible for the financing of the event.

Juri Maibaum: Juri the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES and host of the company’s podcast and YouTube show called “This Week In Cosmos”. He is responsible for outreach and bringing cosmos projects to the conference.
For Updates
We have 5 months to plan this one (for Cosmoverse 1.0 ⚠️  we only had 5 weeks) - so you know it will be epic.

You decide:

By voting “Yes” you believe that the ATOM community should become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

By voting “No” you think that the ATOM community should not become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

Make Cosmos Hub the Lead Sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022

Summary:
If this proposal passes, 2600 ATOM will be allocated to the Cosmoverse team - making the ATOM community the lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022. The Cosmos Hub was the first lead supporter for Cosmoverse 2021 and we would like to keep it that way for this one as well. Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world.

Description:
Cosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 27 & 28, 2022.

Our goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.

Cosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

Where do the funds go?

The sponsorship will help us finance the Cosmoverse conference. 

The main costs include:

Conference venue
F&B (conference + afterparty)
Marketing leading up to the event
Audio and visuals
Official afterparty
Legal costs
How does it benefit the ATOM community?

By allocating 2600 ATOM from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, the Cosmos Hub will become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.

Keynote speech: If this proposal passes, we offer three keynote slots to core Cosmos contributors. We will keep you updated on this topic on the official Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website.

Logo placement: The ATOM logo will be shown as “lead sponsor” on the main conference days. We will make sure everyone at the conference knows that the ATOM community has significantly contributed to covering the conference’s costs and making this a great event.

General Admission Tickets: We will give 15 general admission tickets to the ATOM community. Distribution TBD.

Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.

Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

Event Highlights 2021 and What To Expect

Cosmoverse 2021 took place in Lisbon, Portugal. The conference brought the Cosmos community together and kick-started new developments in the interchain! The attendees were provided with food, beverages, and merchandise and were able to listen to keynotes/ panels that were held by Cosmos thought leaders. Cosmoverse is the most community-driven Cosmos conference in the world! It is organized by and for Cosmonauts. 

This means low ticket prices and no VIP areas. If you attend the conference, you have direct access to all speakers and can ask them questions. 

Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia, and will have the same community vibe - but it will be much bigger! 

There will be many Cosmos speakers at the event, two coffee breaks per day including an assortment of food, two 5-star buffet lunches, an NFT room, a public co-working zone, private meeting rooms for sponsors and their teams, and much, much more. We will be able to provide twice as many tickets as the first conference. Medellin is a vibrant city settled in between a beautiful valley in the heart of Colombia. With many activities besides the ones we will be hosting throughout the week. We will ensure that within the Cosmoverse week, attendees will have the possibility to visit side events and meet Cosmonauts from all over the world!

The Team:

Cryptocito: Cryptocito is the most prominent Cosmos YouTuber in the interchain! Who is responsible for bringing all the cosmos together, through outreach, and planning of the event.

Basil Naser: Basil is part of the Cryptocito team. Last year he founded the Cosmoverse conference with Crypotcito. He is responsible for event operations and branding.

Fabian Klauder: Fabian is the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES, a Cosmos-focused media company. He is responsible for the financing of the event.

Juri Maibaum: Juri the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES and host of the company’s podcast and YouTube show called “This Week In Cosmos”. He is responsible for outreach and bringing cosmos projects to the conference.

See active discussion on the forum  here https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898 ⚠️  ⚠️ .

# Summary
This proposal aims to put forward a clear definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ that provides a stand-alone reference for future Cosmos Hub votes. We examine the technical context and existing discussion on ‘NoWithVeto’, and the range of ways the community understands NoWithVeto. We bridge these ideas into a coherent and thorough definition proposed below.

If passed, changes will be made to the Cosmos Hub documentation and Cosmos Hub Forum templates to reflect the newly accepted definition.

# Proposed Definition for NoWithVeto

***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***

Note: In this definition we use the term “rules of engagement” to refer to practices adopted by the Cosmos Hub community through governance. These may include decision-making processes and social protocols that have passed governance and thus been accepted as rules.

The following is factually correct about how ‘NoWithVeto’ currently operates and will continue to operate regardless of this proposal’s outcome: If quorum is met and greater than 1/3 of participating voting power have voted ‘NoWithVeto’, the proposal fails and is considered to be vetoed. In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.

# Discussion
## Summary of existing definitions
This list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.

1. **As a stronger No:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.
2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.
3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.
4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).
5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.
6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.

## Censorship
It may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3 ⚠️ % of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2 ⚠️  ⚠️ % of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.

## Financial and social cost
‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2 ⚠️  ⚠️ % of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.

Consequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. 

While there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.

# Conclusion
We are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.

Cosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.

# Voting options
We propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:

***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***

Your vote on this proposal indicates the following:
* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.
* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal. Please indicate why in the  Cosmos Hub Forum post https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898 ⚠️  ⚠️ .
* **NO WITH VETO** - ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.
* **ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.
4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).
5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.
6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.

## Censorship
It may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3% of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2% of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.

## Financial and social cost
‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2% of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.

Consequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. 

While there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.

# Conclusion
We are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.

Cosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.

# Voting options
We propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:

***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***

Your vote on this proposal indicates the following:
* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.
* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal. Please indicate why in the [Cosmos Hub Forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898).
* **NO WITH VETO** - ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.
* **ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.",0,title_and_description

Fund incentives for the Interchain Security Incentivized testnet – Game of Chains – from the Community Pool
Voting Start: Wed, 05 Oct 2022 14:34:40 UTC
Voting End: Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:34:40 UTC
👍 96.61%, 👎 0.03%, 🕊️ 3.32%, ❌ 0.02% \n
## Summary
This community pool spend proposal seeks approval to fund **20K ATOM** worth of incentives for the incentivized Interchain Security testnet – Game of Chains – coming to the Cosmos Hub, expected in November 2022.
## Background
Interchain Security (ICS) is a Cosmos SDK capability that has captured the mindshare of the Cosmos Ecosystem for well over the last year. This has been reflected in the engineering efforts by various core entities including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems as well as initial users Quicksilver and Neutron. ICS allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain.
ICS is a complex technology that needs to be rigorously tested. To ensure successful rollout, we are launching an incentivized public testnet where Cosmos Hub validators can participate and build confidence around this technology. Game of Chains will build on the Cosmos Hub’s legacy of running successful adversarial testnet programs in the past including  Game of Zones https://github.com/cosmosdevs/GameOfZones ⚠️  and  Game of Stakes https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/ ⚠️ .
We believe the community will see ICS as a valuable addition to Cosmos Hub for three core reasons. First, it allows for “hub minimalism.” By deploying features on a consumer chain instead of Cosmos Hub, we keep the hub lightweight and reduce the surface area for attacks and vulnerabilities. Second, Interchain Security lowers the barrier for ATOM aligned app chains to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Instead of arranging their own validator set, new app chains can utilize the Cosmos Hub’s existing validator for security. And lastly, Interchain Security accrues value to ATOM and enhances its utility. As new Interchain Secured zones launch, gas fees on these new chains flow back to ATOM stakers through the Hub’s validators.
## Incentivized Testnet
For a successful launch, validators will need to prepare and train for expanding their node operations and governance efforts for every new Interchain Secured chain starting up. We are proposing an incentivized public testnet program that will serve the dual purposes of (1) testing Interchain Security in mainnet-like conditions and (2) providing Cosmos Hub validators the opportunity to build confidence around running the Interchain Security protocol.
In order to prevent delays and adequately prepare for launch, we believe it is critical for all Cosmos Hub validators to participate in this public testnet. For this reason, we’re seeking community approval for 20K ATOM (approximately USD 300k) withdrawn for the community pool to reward validators participating in the Cosmos Hub testnet.
* From this prize pool, 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for Cosmos Hub validators who complete Interchain Security testnet milestones. These milestones will be published at the launch of the testnet.
* The remaining 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for bonuses to validators who help identify bugs or performance issues or help develop new tools and monitoring solutions at the discretion of the jury
* Funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig committee
* Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool

# Adan: non-profit fighting for sound crypto regulation

## Summary

- Adan is a non-profit organization representing the crypto-asset industry in Europe
- Since 2020, Adan has worked relentlessly to fight disproportional and overreaching regulations which threaten the crypto industry's ability to innovate
- We seek 8,000 ATOMS in funding to hire a European Affairs Officer as we ramp up operations in Brussels

## About Adan

Adan is a non-profit trade organization representing the crypto-asset industry. Our members are crypto-native companies and firms that provide industry-specific expertise (legal, consulting, marketing, etc.)

Founded in France in 2020, Adan has over  195 members 6 https://adan.eu ⚠️ /en/association/members ⚠️  in France and Europe across several industry verticals, including DeFi, payments, market making, custody, data analysis, and security, and is the largest crypto trade organization in Europe.

Adan interacts with all stakeholders with interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.

Our unique positioning allows us to rally decentralized DeFi actors and more traditional listed companies and corporations.

-  Adan on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/adaneu/ ⚠️ 

### Mission

- Educate about crypto and help create better narratives around this technology and industry
- Foster an environment favorable to the growth of the industry
- Accompany the implementation of French and European regulatory frameworks adapted to the specificities of the sector
- Build constructive relations between the industry and public institutions

### Funding

Adan is a membership organization and is funded primarily through annual fees.

Being aware that our missions concern not only the Cosmos community but the whole crypto ecosystem, we will ask for grants from other blockchains. Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.

Finally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.

### Governance

Members define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.

See our website for more information about Adan's governance and  Board of Directors 3 https://adan.eu ⚠️ /en/association/governance.

Adan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).

### Works & Publications

Adan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.

Adan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.

In just two short years, Adan has produced an astounding amount of writing and  publications https://adan.eu ⚠️ /en/publications to support its mission:

-  A crypto-euro issued by an American giant, or how Europe is delegating its monetary sovereignty https://adan.eu ⚠️ /en/tribune-les-echos-crypto-euro-en

## Proposal details

The crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.

To this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:

- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.
- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.
- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.
- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).

To overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:

- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda
- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups
- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)
- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests

Given the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.

## Deliverables

We believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.

This report will be delivered to you via this forum. It will consist of different sections, such as :

- actions carried out in the last months;
- missions to be carried out in the coming months;
- distribution of the remaining allocation.

## Funding Amount

Total amount requested: 8,000 ATOM

This corresponds to roughly 100,000 EUR and covers gross salary, recruitment costs, and travel expenses for half a year.

## Governance Discussion

https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-adan-non-profit-fighting-for-sound-crypto-regulation/7416 ⚠️ 

## Governance votes

The following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:

- YES - You agree that persuading regulators to adopt sound and proportional regulation is important and thus wish to fund Adan's work
- NO - You don't agree that persuading regulators is important and thus do not agree to fund Adan's work
- NO WITH VETO - A 'NoWithVeto' vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of 'NoWithVeto' votes is greater than a third of the total votes, the proposal is rejected, and the deposits are burned.
- ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to the quorum but formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

## Proposal details

The crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.

To this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:

- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.
- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.
- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.
- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).

To overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:

- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda
- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups
- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)
- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests

Given the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.

## Deliverables

We believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.

This report will be delivered to you via this forum. It will consist of different sections, such as :

- actions carried out in the last months;
- missions to be carried out in the coming months;
- distribution of the remaining allocation.

## Funding Amount

Total amount requested: 8,000 ATOM

This corresponds to roughly 100,000 EUR and covers gross salary, recruitment costs, and travel expenses for half a year.

- NO - You don't agree that persuading regulators is important and thus do not agree to fund Adan's work
- NO WITH VETO - A 'NoWithVeto' vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of 'NoWithVeto' votes is greater than a third of the total votes, the proposal is rejected, and the deposits are burned.

"Adan: non-profit fighting for sound crypto regulation

# Adan: non-profit fighting for sound crypto regulation

## Summary

- Adan is a non-profit organization representing the crypto-asset industry in Europe
- Since 2020, Adan has worked relentlessly to fight disproportional and overreaching regulations which threaten the crypto industry's ability to innovate
- We seek 8,000 ATOMS in funding to hire a European Affairs Officer as we ramp up operations in Brussels

## About Adan

Adan is a non-profit trade organization representing the crypto-asset industry. Our members are crypto-native companies and firms that provide industry-specific expertise (legal, consulting, marketing, etc.)

Founded in France in 2020, Adan has over [195 members 6](https://adan.eu/en/association/members) in France and Europe across several industry verticals, including DeFi, payments, market making, custody, data analysis, and security, and is the largest crypto trade organization in Europe.

Adan interacts with all stakeholders with interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.

Our unique positioning allows us to rally decentralized DeFi actors and more traditional listed companies and corporations.

- [Adan on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/adaneu/)

### Mission

- Educate about crypto and help create better narratives around this technology and industry
- Foster an environment favorable to the growth of the industry
- Accompany the implementation of French and European regulatory frameworks adapted to the specificities of the sector
- Build constructive relations between the industry and public institutions

### Team

- Faustine Fleuret: President & CEO | [Twitter 8](https://twitter.com/faufleuret) / [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faustine-fleuret-640b67a4/)
- Mélodie Ambroise: Head of Strategy & Institutional Relations | [Twitter 3](https://twitter.com/mambroise23) / [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m%C3%A9lodie-ambroise/)

- Dorian Ravaute: Fiscal Affairs Officer |  [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorianravaute/)

### Funding

Adan is a membership organization and is funded primarily through annual fees.

Being aware that our missions concern not only the Cosmos community but the whole crypto ecosystem, we will ask for grants from other blockchains. Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.

Finally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.

### Governance

Members define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.

See our website for more information about Adan's governance and [Board of Directors 3](https://adan.eu/en/association/governance).

Adan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).

### Works & Publications

Adan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.

Adan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.

Takeoff Proposal from Cyber to Cosmos
Voting Start: Thu, 21 May 2020 18:00:11 UTC

👍 24.42%, 👎 45.68%, 🕊️ 29.87%, ❌ 0.01% \n
cyber Congress (https://cybercongress.ai ⚠️ ) developed Cyber (https://github.com/cybercongress ⚠️ /go-cyber ⚠️ ): a software for replacing existing internet behemoth monopolies, such as Google, which exploited outdated internet protocols using the common patterns of our semantic interaction. These corps lock the information, produced by the users, from search, social and commercial knowledge graphs in private databases, and then sell this knowledge back as advertisement. They stand as an insurmountable wall between content creators and consumers extracting an overwhelming majority of the created value.

We propose ATOM holders to invest 10,000 ATOM from the community pool into the Takeoff of Cyber. In exchange, at the end of its donation round (https://cyber.page ⚠️ /gol/takeoff ⚠️  ⚠️ ), and when an IBC connection will become possible, cyber Congress will transfer CYB tokens back to the community pool. Passing this proposal will transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to cyber Congress multisig (https://www.mintscan.io/account/cosmos1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqv2tkd9a ⚠️ ).

Full Proposal-Manifest text: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUYDQt9tqLQJwxnUck7dQY3XmZA3tDtpFh3Hchkg7oH46 ⚠️ 

or at https://cyber.page ⚠️ /gol/takeoff ⚠️  ⚠️ 

The software we offer resembles a decentralized google (https://github.com/cybercongress ⚠️ ):
- A protocol spec and the rationale behind it
- go-cyber: our implementation using cosmos-sdk
- cyber.page ⚠️ : PoC reference web interface
- launch-kit: useful tools for launching cosmos-sdk based chains
- cyberindex: GraphQL middleware for cyber
- euler Foundation: mainnet predecessor of cyber Foundation: the DAO, which will handle all the donated ETH
- documentation and various side tools

Cyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics core of the Internet. It does so by opening up access to evergrowing semantics core taught to it by the users.

Economics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.

You already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.

With the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.

Cosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.

A good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (с) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).

The solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.

This means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.

If this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will open another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in Game of Links (https://cyber.page ⚠️ /gol/) or Takeoff https://cyber.page ⚠️ /gol/takeoff ⚠️  ⚠️  independently. If you have question you can ask them either on Cyber topic on Cosmos forum (https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cyber-a-decentralized-google-for-provable-and-relevant-answers ⚠️ ) or Cyber forum (https://ai.cybercongress.ai ⚠️ ).

This means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.

If this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will open another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in Game of Links (https://cyber.page/gol/) or Takeoff https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff independently. If you have question you can ask them either on Cyber topic on Cosmos forum (https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cyber-a-decentralized-google-for-provable-and-relevant-answers) or Cyber forum (https://ai.cybercongress.ai).

"Takeoff Proposal from Cyber to Cosmos

cyber Congress (https://cybercongress.ai) developed Cyber (https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): a software for replacing existing internet behemoth monopolies, such as Google, which exploited outdated internet protocols using the common patterns of our semantic interaction. These corps lock the information, produced by the users, from search, social and commercial knowledge graphs in private databases, and then sell this knowledge back as advertisement. They stand as an insurmountable wall between content creators and consumers extracting an overwhelming majority of the created value.

We propose ATOM holders to invest 10,000 ATOM from the community pool into the Takeoff of Cyber. In exchange, at the end of its donation round (https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff), and when an IBC connection will become possible, cyber Congress will transfer CYB tokens back to the community pool. Passing this proposal will transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to cyber Congress multisig (https://www.mintscan.io/account/cosmos1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqv2tkd9a).

Full Proposal-Manifest text: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUYDQt9tqLQJwxnUck7dQY3XmZA3tDtpFh3Hchkg7oH46

or at https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff

The software we offer resembles a decentralized google (https://github.com/cybercongress):
- A protocol spec and the rationale behind it
- go-cyber: our implementation using cosmos-sdk
- cyber.page: PoC reference web interface
- launch-kit: useful tools for launching cosmos-sdk based chains
- cyberindex: GraphQL middleware for cyber
- euler Foundation: mainnet predecessor of cyber Foundation: the DAO, which will handle all the donated ETH
- documentation and various side tools

Cyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics core of the Internet. It does so by opening up access to evergrowing semantics core taught to it by the users.

Economics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.

You already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.

With the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.

Cosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.

A good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (с) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).

The solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.

ATOM 🤝 Osmosis:  Allocate Community Pool to ATOM Liquidity Incentives

ATOMs should be the base money of Cosmos, just like ETH is the base money of the entire Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. ATOM is currently well positioned to play this role among Cosmos assets because it has the highest market cap, most liquidity, largest brand, and many integrations with fiat onramps. ATOM is the gateway to Cosmos.

In the Cosmos Hub Port City vision, ATOMs are pitched as equity in the Cosmos Hub.  However, this alone is insufficient to establish ATOM as the base currency of the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Instead, the ATOM community must work to actively promote the use of ATOMs throughout the Cosmos ecosystem, rather than passively relying on the Hub's reputation to create ATOM's value.

In order to cement the role of ATOMs in Cosmos DeFi, the Cosmos Hub should leverage its community pool to help align incentives with other protocols within the Cosmos ecosystem. We propose beginning this initiative by using the community pool ATOMs to incentivize deep ATOM base pair liquidity pools on the Osmosis Network.

Osmosis is the first IBC-enabled DeFi application. Within its 3 weeks of existence, it has already 100x’d the number of IBC transactions ever created, demonstrating the power of IBC and the ability of the Cosmos SDK to bootstrap DeFi protocols with $100M+ TVL in a short period of time. Since its announcement Osmosis has helped bring renewed attention and interest to Cosmos from the crypto community at large and kickstarted the era of Cosmos DeFi.

Osmosis has already helped in establishing ATOM as the Schelling Point of the Cosmos ecosystem.  The genesis distribution of OSMO was primarily based on an airdrop to ATOM holders specifically, acknowledging the importance of ATOM to all future projects within the Cosmos. Furthermore, the Osmosis LP rewards currently incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs of the platform.

Osmosis has the ability to incentivize AMM liquidity, a feature not available on any other IBC-enabled DEX. Osmosis already uses its own native OSMO liquidity rewards to incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs, leading to ~2.2 ⚠️  million ATOMs already providing liquidity on the platform.

In addition to these native OSMO LP Rewards, the platform also includes a feature called “external incentives” that allows anyone to permissionlessly add additional incentives in any token to the LPs of any AMM pools they wish. You can read more about this mechanism here: https://medium.com/osmosis/osmosis-liquidity-mining-101-2fa58d0e9d4d#f413 ⚠️  . Pools containing Cosmos assets such as AKT and XPRT are already planned to receive incentives from their respective community pools and/or foundations.

We propose the Cosmos Hub dedicate 100,000 ATOMs from its Community Pool to be allocated towards liquidity incentives on Osmosis over the next 3 months. This community fund proposal will transfer 100,000 ATOMs to a multisig group who will then allocate the ATOMs to bonded liquidity gauges on Osmosis on a biweekly basis, according to direction given by Cosmos Hub governance.  For simplicity, we propose setting the liquidity incentives to initially point to Osmosis Pool #1, the ATOM/OSMO pool, which is the pool with by far the highest TVL and Volume. Cosmos Hub governance can then use Text Proposals to further direct the multisig members to reallocate incentives to new pools.

The multisig will consist of a 2/3 key holder set consisting of the following individuals whom have all agreed to participate in this process shall this proposal pass:

- Zaki Manian
- Federico Kunze
- Marko Baricevic

This is one small step for the Hub, but one giant leap for ATOM-aligned.

Lowering Liquidity Pool Creation Fee

Although the Gravity DEX launch on Cosmos Hub is technically successful, there exists several necessary ingredient to achieve significant user-base growth.

It includes of course, “farming incentives” for liquidity providers, but also the high pool creation fee disturbs quick adoption of pools with new tokens. The pool creation fee was introduced to prevent possible spamming attack to create tons of meaningless pools which will cause performance burden on Cosmos Hub.

Currently the fee(`PoolCreationFee`) is 40 Atoms, which is almost $1,600 as now. It was suggested when the Atom price is under $10, but now we have more reasons to make it significantly lower so that we can promote quicker new token introduction to the Gravity DEX.

Therefore we suggest 5 Atoms for pool creation fee, which is equivalent to about $200. We think that it is still very conservative amount for spamming prevention. Also we can suggest to adjust the fee amount again when it is necessary.

I propose changing the Evmos coin's symbol from EVMOS to EVM because it is shorter and more memorable.

Correspondingly, the coin's basic unit used in source codes is to be renamed to `uevm`.

The following table summarizes the proposed naming convention. A few other chains are included for comparison.

# Include CosmWasm in Rho Upgrade

## Summary

Signaling proposal to include CosmWasm on the Cosmos Hub in v8-Rho upgrade targeting Q2 2022. Further details and discussion at  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243 ⚠️  ⚠️ .

## Details

This is a signaling proposal to include CosmWasm in the v8-Rho upgrade. The Cosmos Hub team at Interchain GmbH has done technical feasibility research by speaking with CosmWasm core contributors and validators to understand the burden of integration and believe it is technically feasible with resources in Interchain GmbH and Lido as well as regular advice meetings from Confio.

The instance of CosmWasm included on the Cosmos Hub will be governance gated and use Cosmos SDK v0.46.x. The governance feature set created by Confio, funded by  Prop 25 https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/25 ⚠️ , works so that all of the wasmd Message types can be executed by the chain’s governance module. These messages all otherwise have configurations so that they can be executed by one account, any account, or no accounts. Each message type should be set to “no account” so that it is only possible to execute messages with Governance. One alternative possibility that needs further review is whether to allow “one account” and designate it as the new governance module account to take advantage of the new features in the governance module coming in v8-Rho.

CosmWasm on the hub comes with benefits and drawbacks that deserve serious attention. A summary and background of the topic has been posted to  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243 ⚠️  ⚠️  where further discussion is taking place. Please visit and take these into consideration when voting.

## Require a minimum 5% commission for all validator nodes

## Require a minimum 5% commission for all validator nodes.

### Reasoning: Competition drives innovation. Innovation drives sustainability and token value.
We should build a community where validators truly innovate and create value for delegators, rather than relying on their 0% commission to attract delegators. Allowing unsustainably low commission rates promotes spam and will not motivate validators to create innovative solutions for delegators, potentially stagnating the development of the Cosmos Network. 

Having a 5% minimum commission ensures that validators are incentivized to innovate to acquire delegators. This will also encourage greater decentralization on the Cosmos Network as validators compete for delegators based on merit (rather than 0% commissions). Additionally, it is necessary to provide proper incentives to validators for their work running and securing the Cosmos Network, especially during crypto winters. 

If this proposal is approved, the Cosmos Network would be updated so that:
1.  Existing validator nodes with commission rates set to less than 5% will have their commission automatically updated to 5%
2.  New validator nodes will have a floor commission rate of 5% 

### Vote: 
Yes – If you want to add a 5% minimum commission to encourage validators to innovate and add value for delegators, promote decentralization, and adequately compensate validators for their role in securing the network
No - If you want to leave Cosmos without a minimum commission amount

ATOM 2.0: A new vision for Cosmos Hub

👍 47.51%, 👎 1.82%, 🕊️ 13.27%, ❌ 37.39% \n
## Summary\nWe propose a new Cosmos Hub vision document, a counterpart to the 2017 paper which focused primarily on the network of IBC-connected chains. With the creation of the Cosmos Stack (Tendermint, IBC, and SDK) and the development of key technologies for secure economic scaling (Interchain Security and Liquid Staking), the original vision of the Hub has been fulfilled. This document marks the transition to the next phase of the Cosmos Hub as an infrastructure service platform, and a renewed role for ATOM as preferred collateral within the Cosmos Network. It describes two pieces of app-specific functionality, the Interchain Scheduler and Interchain Allocator, which together form a flywheel for accelerating interchain growth. The Interchain Scheduler is a cross-chain block space marketplace, which generates revenues from cross-chain MEV. These revenues are used by the Interchain Allocator to capitalize new Cosmos chains, foster interchain collaboration, and thereby expand the total addressable market of the Scheduler. This paper also describes a new issuance regime optimized for Liquid Staking, where after a 36 month transition period, exponential issuance is reduced to a constant amount of ATOM issued per month. To administer the proposed plan, the paper describes the formation of Cosmos Councils, domain-specialized entities that carry out development and operations. Cosmos Councils together form the Cosmos Assembly, a body that is accountable to ATOM holders, responsible for setting yearly goals, resourcing, and administering work undertaken on behalf of Cosmos Hub.\n\nWe have included the paper below in its entirety for the community’s consideration.\n\n The Cosmos Hub v1.2 https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdC3YuZBUq5b9mEr3bKTDRq4XLcxafe3LHqDNFUgUoa61\n\n\n## ⚠️  Authors\n- Sam Hart, Interchain GmbH\n- Zaki Manian, Iqlusion\n- Ethan Buchman, Informal Systems\n- Max Einhorn, Iqlusion\n- Jehan Tremback, Informal Systems\n- Youssef Amrani, Cosmos Contributor\n- David Feiock, Galileo\n- Jack Zampolin, Strangelove\n- Udit Vira, Hypha Worker Co-op\n- Sacha Saint-Leger, Hypha Worker Co-op\n- Kristi Poldsam, Iqlusion\n- Jelena Djuric, Informal Systems\n\n\n## Governance Votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n- YES - You approve of and wish to ratify the contents of the proposed paper\n- NO - You don’t approve of the contents of paper.

ATOM2.0 will split the community in half
Voting Start: Fri, 11 Nov 2022 18:02:10 UTC
Voting End: Fri, 25 Nov 2022 18:02:10 UTC
👍 1.87%, 👎 29.16%, 🕊️ 49.36%, ❌ 19.59% \n
## The community is split, 50% 50% if ATOM2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  passes it will lead to a community split or a fork.

If we count only stakers direct vote on ATOM2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  we get this distribution: 
Yes 12,964,821 ATOM
No 279,703 ATOM
NWV 11,830,808 ATOM 
Abstain 520361 ATOM
Clearly the proposal is extremely controversial, stakers are split 50% 50%, its also not popular as the majority of those 30k addresses are actually just bots using low balances and dust to influence perception of voters (snapshot as of Saturday) 
Seems like some external factors are influencing validators neutral representation of delegators.
If the vote were to be unbiased the validator vote would represent the same distribution as the stakers vote, so why we ask why the validator vote is skewed towards yes.
This justifies no with veto as a way for validators to protect the real interests of delegators, 50% of the delegator voting power is in disagreement its not a small minority.

## ATOM2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  treasury allocation described by Zaki and Youssef

Dilute 44m ATOMs and split:

- Consumer chains 10%

- The other 90% (risky speculative bets)
1 Invest in Cosmos early ventures
2 LP positions 
3 token swaps
4 Lending
5 incentives to boost adoption of ATOM backed stable-coins 

Explain to us why this is not worse than Alameda, dilute other peoples capital and gamble with it.

If the 90% used for gambling were to be removed then we would be left with a 4/5m ATOMs needed to fund consumer chains a more reasonable target which would be easily funded without the need for dilution but rather through a higher community pool tax (the tax shouldn't be in perpetuity and we should target a test amount for the first year not the full 4m).

The part of the proposal about speculating with stakers capital on LPing, loans, etc.. should be removed or Cosmos will just end up being the Do Kwon/ Luna/SBF/Alameda/FTX/Su Zhu of next cycle.

ATOM 2 is just gambling:
- 50% of LP positions are at a loss https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09192 ⚠️ 
- 90% of LP tokens eventually become rugpulls https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07220 ⚠️ 
- VCs don't make money, 50% don't return 1x https://medium.com/the-mission/the-meeting-that-showed-me-the-truth-about-vcs-and-how-they-don-t-make-money-ab72b52b50cd ⚠️ 
- Staking derivatives have extremely low profitability which doesn't justify the enormous risk and centralization pressure they impose on the hub, Eth staking derivatives cannot beat the yield of US treasuries, ETH/stETH is nominally at a loss and yielding less then 3%, ATOM staking derivatives have 3k daily volume which will translate in ridiculously low APR
- Liabilities are not revenue https://pastebin.com/fVQ81d7H ⚠️  FTT is a liability, when GAAP is applied. See current systemic risk. 

Not one of ATOM2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  proposers has ever managed any money, nor they have consulted any money manager, they have zero history of AUM peformance.


## The ICF is behind ATOM2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ 

ATOM 2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  is a proposal by the ICF, no matter how much they deny, 2 ICF members (one senior) are cosigners (Ethan and Sam) we find it also very telling that they planned re-delegations at the same time as the ATOM2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  vote, they will surely use those to reward compliant validators after the vote.
After ATOM 2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  gets implemented it will strengthen the case for ATOM to become a security as the treasury will be profit seeking and revenue sharing and ICF might be regarded as the issuing party as they are the main entity behind the ATOM2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  paper and were one of the biggest entities during the ICO genesis allocation.
Usually dilution is seen as the last alternative for financing and it’s a sign of a failing firm that can not gather funding in other ways, it’s the last chance, when you have no other option left, is the ICF solvent? 

Why does a centralized council need to be created when the community pool works just fine? See Evmos for example. 
Anything in Atom 2.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  can be done slowly, while Cosmos reaps the reward of ICS, while 90% of chains like Solana fail, Cosmos took the turtle approach and got rewarded by being one of the best performers in the last year, now ICS is about to launch. Let’s see how it develops before committing to a highly risky plan, and please lets not split the community, lets abandon controversial changes.

# Juno Moneta Upgrade Proposal\n\nThis on-chain upgrade governance proposal, more commonly called Moneta, is to adopt junod v2.0.x. This will enable CosmWasm Smart Contracts on the Juno Mainnet, and will also add a number of updates, fixes and new modules.\n\n# Background\n\nSince our genesis on October 1st there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint. The following updates are included in junod v2.0.x:\n\n* Adds wasmd and cosmwasm\n* Fixes a bug with pinning contracts\n* Enforces a minimum validator commission\n* Ensures that new validators joining the set have to adhere to this\n* Includes a wasmvm security patch\n* Includes increase to cosmwasm default compile costs\n* Version bump to 44.5 ⚠️  SDK\n* Adds IBC proposal handler\n* Enable Authz and Feegrant modules\n\n# Validator Minimum Gas Price\n\nWith smart contracts enabled, it is even more important to set a minimum gas price for your node and validators. We suggest to set it at 0.025ujuno. This setting can be changed inside .juno/config/app.toml.\n\n# Note\n\nThis is an experimental release, we strongly encourage all the community test the new feature as best they can before deploying sensitive dApps. \n\n# On-Chain Upgrade Process\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of Juno will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. \n\nCosmovisor is a tool that can help you with this process. There is a guide for setting it up  in the Juno docs https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/setting-up-cosmovisor.\n\nValidators ⚠️  can coordinate with each other on Discord in advance of the release. As the target block is more than 5 days away, changes in average block speed might change the target time.\n\nWe are aiming for 1600UTC on the 15th of December, but be aware that this block could arrive +/- 2 hours or more.\n

👍 85.93%, 👎 8.18%, 🕊️ 5.84%, ❌ 0.03% \n
After the successful mainnet launch and Moneta upgrade, Juno has become a critical part of the Cosmos ecosystem. In order to double down on Juno's presence in the ecosystem, being a natively integrated chain on Keplr Wallet is one of the best ways to increase the reach of Juno protocol to hundreds of thousands of interchain-native users.

Therefore, the Keplr development team requests an allocation of $360K (based on JUNO priced as $10.37 ⚠️  30d historical average daily close price according to Coingecko) from the Juno community pool for development, operations, and infrastructure for Keplr Wallet native integration.

The specific details are the following:

- Deliverable #1: Keplr extension native integration
- Juno listed as a native chain on Keplr extension
- Node operation support
- Provide Staking & Governance interface, infrastructure operations

- Deliverable #2: Keplr mobile support
- Juno listed as a native chain on Keplr mobile
- Node operation support
- Provide Staking & Governance interface

Details:

Keplr will guarantee a minimum of 12 months of native integration support for Juno on Keplr Extension and Mobile. Payment will be under 1-year linear vesting.

By listing Juno on Keplr wallet, the team expects the enriching impact of Juno on the Cosmos ecosystem and helping users to easily use JUNO for staking and governance.

# Interchain DEX liquidity kickstarter

The JunoSwap Core development team requests 2,999,205 JUNO 
in order to kickstart liquidity incentives on the Interchain DEX. 
The following pairs will be incentivized:

* JUNO/ATOM
* JUNO/RAW
* JUNO/UST

This is beneficial in order to increase early liquidity (attract LPs)
and most importantly to ensure that price slippage is reduced.

This proposal, if passed, would distribute the requested funds to a multi-sig managed by 
Jake Hartnell (Core-1 & stargaze), The Frey (Core-2 & Needlecast) & Dimi (Core-1 & stakefish) 
which will deploy the funds to the above mentioned pools on a monthly basis, starting once the external incentive contract is completed & tested extensively. 
Should the contract for whatever reason not be production ready, all funds would be returned to the community pool.

The prop #14 incentive program will last for 365 days.

* JUNO/ATOM = 3287 JUNO/day
* JUNO/RAW = 3287 JUNO/day
* JUNO/UST = 1643 JUNO/day

**Important:**

* These incentives will go live upon completion of the external incentive contract.
* Retroactive rewards will not go into effect for this proposal.
* Retroactive rewards may come via $RAW & the JunoSwap DAO.

# Correcting the gamed stakedrop - Proposed by Core-1 after numerous discussions with the community.\n\nBy voting yes on this proposal you agree to reduce the gamed whale address to 50k  (Whalecap that was originally set per entity prior to genesis).\n\n**Note:** The facts are that the Juno genesis stakedrop was gamed by a single entity. Willingly or unwillingly is not relevant to this matter.\nThe whale gamer poses a growing risk to the network and the stakedrop error may be corrected. \nGamed funds were consolidated into 1 address right after genesis which proves that 1 entity had custody over all addresses (linked below). \nThis considerably broke the stakedrop rules of having a max 50k ATOM : 50k JUNO per entity. \nAt the time of the genesis stakedrop there was no way for Core-1 to pro-actively counter act this behavior. \nIf this information would have been known prior to launch, 51/52 of those addresses would have been removed entirely.\n\n## Risks of doing nothing\n\n* High risk to on-chain governance (already has half of quorum)\n* Potential of buying validators with delegations in order to bribe them away from acting\n* Whale gamer can single handedly wipe out the entire DEX liquidity in 10 min or less (Should his funds be unbonded)\n* Fear in the community on a daily basis\n\n## Order of operations\n\n1. Upgrade \n2. Remove funds from whale gamer acct https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8\n3 ⚠️ . Send funds to the Juno community pool\n4.

# Community Spend Proposal for Creation of Terra Developer Fund

In the last few days, the Terra CosmWasm-based smart contract network has suffered a potentially catastrophic attack. Though the full implications are unclear, there is likely irreversible damage to Terra's user and developer base.

The Juno Network consists of a strong community of passionate users and developers, and like Terra shares the mindset that the true value of a network lies in the protocols and applications built upon it. This proposal is an endeavor to enable Terra developers to continue building and innovating. Furthermore, this aims to be a lifeline for their existing users to continue to benefit from these developers’ platforms.

Several Terra projects have reached out and expressed interest in migrating to and developing on Juno Network. It is expected that many more innovative projects and teams will follow with the passing of this proposal. 

## Background

On May 9th, 2022 the Terra chain appears to have suffered a financial attack that resulted in the insolvency of the network, and a crash in both UST and LUNA. 

The combined market cap of LUNA/UST prior to the attack was in excess of 39.1 ⚠️  billion dollars. There are many hugely successful CosmWasm applications on Terra. These applications and protocols will need a home going forward. 

Juno, as a firmly established CosmWasm chain, can provide a platform and considerable community support for these developers to continue building their projects - a new home. 

This will also benefit Juno by bringing in a wave of new users, developers and applications.

## Proposed Use of Funds

The Community Fund contains roughly 16,248,583 JUNO, or approximately $75,880,883 in USD equivalent / €72,845,647 in EUR equivalent at the time of writing.

This proposal would allocate a total of 1,000,000 JUNO (700,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool & 300,000 JUNO from the Juno Development Fund) to a Terra Developer Fund Multi-sig for project migration and continued development in the Juno ecosystem. It is worth approximately $4,670,000 in USD equivalent / €4,483,647 EUR equivalent at the time of writing.

Via governance, the funding could be further expanded with additional disbursements, if development accelerates, or returned back to the respective community and developer fund pools from the Multi-sig, if development wanes. A proposal will be put up 60 days from the passing of this proposal to decide.

## Proposed Management of Funds

If this proposal passes, 1 million total JUNO will be sent to the treasury of a newly-formed Terra Developer Fund Multisig on DAODAO. Multi-sig members can vote on project funding on a case-by-case basis.

The Multi-sig will be structured as a 5 of 9 Multi-sig managed by:

* Jack Zampolin (Core-1, Strangelove) juno130mdu9a0etmeuw52qfxk73pn0ga6gawk4k539x

**Multisig Address:** juno1lgnstas4ruflg0eta394y8epq67s4rzhg5anssz3rc5zwvjmmvcql6qps2

By voting **YES**, you agree that 1,000,000 JUNO in total should be utilized, as described within the context of this proposal, for a Terra Developer Fund (700,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool & 300,000 JUNO from the Juno Development Fund).

By Voting **NO** it means you do not believe these Community & Developer Funds should be utilized to facilitate this migration of Terra Projects and Developers to Juno.

By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their 500 JUNO deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.

The combined market cap of LUNA/UST prior to the attack was in excess of 39.1 billion dollars. There are many hugely successful CosmWasm applications on Terra. These applications and protocols will need a home going forward. 

Juno, as a firmly established CosmWasm chain, can provide a platform and considerable community support for these developers to continue building their projects - a new home. 

This will also benefit Juno by bringing in a wave of new users, developers and applications.

## Proposed Use of Funds

The Community Fund contains roughly 16,248,583 JUNO, or approximately $75,880,883 in USD equivalent / €72,845,647 in EUR equivalent at the time of writing.

This proposal would allocate a total of 1,000,000 JUNO (700,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool & 300,000 JUNO from the Juno Development Fund) to a Terra Developer Fund Multi-sig for project migration and continued development in the Juno ecosystem. It is worth approximately $4,670,000 in USD equivalent / €4,483,647 EUR equivalent at the time of writing.

Via governance, the funding could be further expanded with additional disbursements, if development accelerates, or returned back to the respective community and developer fund pools from the Multi-sig, if development wanes. A proposal will be put up 60 days from the passing of this proposal to decide.

## Proposed Management of Funds

If this proposal passes, 1 million total JUNO will be sent to the treasury of a newly-formed Terra Developer Fund Multisig on DAODAO. Multi-sig members can vote on project funding on a case-by-case basis.

The Multi-sig will be structured as a 5 of 9 Multi-sig managed by:

* Jack Zampolin (Core-1, Strangelove) juno130mdu9a0etmeuw52qfxk73pn0ga6gawk4k539x
* Max (Juno Community Lead) juno1az0ehz2e5emudyh8hx2qwtfely0lstzj08gg9j
* Jake Hartnell (Core-1, Stargaze) juno18qw9ydpewh405w4lvmuhlg9gtaep79vy2gmtr2
* Dimi (Core-1, Stakefish) juno1s33zct2zhhaf60x4a90cpe9yquw99jj0zen8pt
* The Frey (Core-2, Needlecast) juno17dn5e2n6w60pzyxeq79apr05r6jzfw7wha8558
* Pupmos (Juno Validator & Relayer) juno1njyvry0t3j5dy4rr6ar5zfglg3cy2e8u745hl7
* Kevin Garrison (Oni Validator, Proposer) juno1jwxjzpwdtglf7a35sackv0dn0hr9nk6h6ctsh4
* Ben 2x4 (DAODAO, Developer) juno1ewq9l5ae69csh57j8sgjh8z37ypm3lt0jzamwy
* Orkun (Deus Labs, JunoTools, Dev) juno17skjxhtt54prnpxcs7a5rv9znlldpe5kwmn2nc


**Multisig Address:** juno1lgnstas4ruflg0eta394y8epq67s4rzhg5anssz3rc5zwvjmmvcql6qps2

## Vote:

By voting **YES**, you agree that 1,000,000 JUNO in total should be utilized, as described within the context of this proposal, for a Terra Developer Fund (700,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool & 300,000 JUNO from the Juno Development Fund).

By Voting **NO** it means you do not believe these Community & Developer Funds should be utilized to facilitate this migration of Terra Projects and Developers to Juno.

By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their 500 JUNO deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",0,title_and_description

Cosmoverse 2022 Sponsorship + Hacker's Lounge

Summary:

If this proposal passes, 15,000 JUNO will be allocated to the Cosmoverse team - giving Juno Two Keynote slots, Branding all over the conference, a 2.5m x 2.5m exhibition stand with LCD screen and branding banners, an exclusive Juno branded hacker’s lounge (that is one complete floor, 200 sq.m that can fit 150 people alone). The Juno Hacker’s lounge will be a great place for developers/talents to network and connect. In close coordination with the Core-1 team, we will make the best use of the Hacker’s lounge.

Description:

Cosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 26-28, 2022 (3 Day Event)

Our goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.
We expect around 1,000 attendees, with the majority coming from Latin American countries - a huge market in the crypto ecosystem.

Cosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

Where do the funds go?

- Conference venue
- F&B (conference + afterparty)
- Marketing and communications
- Production, audio and visuals
- Operational & logistical costs
Legal

The current cost for the 3-day event already exceeds $300k. Receiving support from the Juno community would contribute tremendously to ensuring that Cosmoverse will be a great success.

How does it benefit the Juno community?

By allocating 15,000 Juno from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, Juno will become the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum. Besides, the Juno community will have an exclusive 200sqm Hacker’s lounge for all conference days (that no other project has), and can fit 150 people.

- 2 Keynote speeches: If this proposal passes, we offer two keynote slots to the Juno core team (usually it’s only one keynote per project). We will keep you updated on this topic on the official Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website.
- Hacker’s Lounge: We will provide Juno with their own Hacker’s lounge, where developers can play around with CosmWasm tech, hack and earn bounties, learn, and build cool stuff. The Juno Hackers lounge is a great place for developers and talents to network and connect.
- Booth in networking area: We provide the Juno community with their own booth stand in the main networking area at the conference - a 2.5m x 2.5m exhibition stand with LCD screen and branding banners.
- Marketing: Marketing plans including (paid SM marketing, and on ground marketing leading up to the event) to attract local developers and crypto enthusiasts to come to the event and learn more about Cosmoverse and Juno.
- Merchandise: Exclusive Juno merchandise, made for 500+ attendees, we will be collaborating with merch venders from the Juno Community as well as others. 
- General Admission Tickets: We will give 10 general admission tickets to the Juno core team or the Juno community. Distribution TBD.
- Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

For Updates

We have 4 months to plan this one so you know it will be epic. We have a lot of high level speakers we would like to bring to Cosmoverse 2022 and to keep up with the updates please follow us on our Twitter @CosmoverseHQ as well as our website www.cosmosverse.org ⚠️ .

You decide:

- By voting “Yes” you believe that Juno Network should become the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022 and get an exclusive hacker's lounge.
- By voting “No” you think that Juno Network should not become the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022 and should not get an exclusive hacker's lounge.

Increase Governance Proposal Minimum Deposit
Voting Start: Mon, 18 Jul 2022 22:04:29 UTC

👍 99.03%, 👎 0.76%, 🕊️ 0.17%, ❌ 0.01% \n
# Proposal Deposit Concept :-
* For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be submitted with a deposit of the amount defined by the **min_deposit** param in the governance module before the deposit end time.
* A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.
* The proposer account is only required to deposit **1 JUNO**.

# Deposit Refund and Burn Concept :-
* If the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount.
* If the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4 ⚠️ %) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.

# Proposition :-
By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit costs **500 JUNO** or approximately **1,500** in **USD** equivalent, which currently appears to be inadequate at preventing spam proposals. Historically, the cost of submitting a governance proposal into voting period has been much higher to deter spam proposals.

With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to **1000 JUNO** or approximately **3,000** in **USD** equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance.

# Voting :-
* By voting **YES**, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 500 JUNO to 1000 JUNO.
* By voting **NO**, you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements.
* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
* By voting **NOWITHVETO**, you seek penalizing the proposal depositors by burning their deposit of 500 JUNO, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold, which would result in proposal failure if reached.

* For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be submitted with a deposit of the amount defined by the **min_deposit** param in the governance module before the deposit end time.
* A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.
* The proposer account is only required to deposit **1 JUNO**.

# Deposit Refund and Burn Concept :-
* If the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount.
* If the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4%) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.

# Proposition :-
By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit costs **500 JUNO** or approximately **1,500** in **USD** equivalent, which currently appears to be inadequate at preventing spam proposals. Historically, the cost of submitting a governance proposal into voting period has been much higher to deter spam proposals.

With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to **1000 JUNO** or approximately **3,000** in **USD** equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance.

# Voting :-
* By voting **YES**, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 500 JUNO to 1000 JUNO.
* By voting **NO**, you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements.
* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
* By voting **NOWITHVETO**, you seek penalizing the proposal depositors by burning their deposit of 500 JUNO, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold, which would result in proposal failure if reached.

Increase Validator Set to 150

# Increase Validator Set to 150

With the recent growth of Juno Network, we have seen a great deal of development and newcomers entering the space, with many new community members and validators wishing to participate as active validators. Currently the floor to become an active validator is quite high, at nearly 47,700 JUNO or approximately $168,000 USD.

As of right now, there is currently a number of validators sitting just outside the active set who have also been active historically, with many more waiting for a set expansion to join in consensus. A more diverse set of validators brings new ideas into the space, new viewpoints in governance and often leads to new innovation and development for the chain.

As with all set expansions, it is possible that expanding the set could have a small effect on the overall block times taking longer, as more validators will be required to achieve consensus. After reviewing analysis of previous set expansions, these effects appear negligible upon block times during that period, but it is important to communicate clearly both the pros and cons of any parameter change to the network.

## Decentralization of Stake

Set expansions are not a perfect science, and in reviewing that same analysis provided by some other talented validators, we have seen that historically these expansions don't always lead to further decentralization of stake on their own. 

We hope that delegators will take the opportunity of this set expansion to **rebalance their stake** from the top of the active set to competent validators lower on the list.

Balancing your stake **outside the top 10 to 20 validators** on the network is the best way to assist in this initiative, as we work together as a community to improve the voting power balance on Juno even further.

## Best Practices

We also strongly encourage new validators entering the set to avoid behavior such as **NFT giveaways**, **validator specific snapshots** or **commission refunds/rebates** which circumvent the 5 percent minimum commissions as established by  Juno Network Prop 3 https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/3 ⚠️ .

Equally we recommend that delegators and investors avoid participating in these activities if they see them, and instead find strong validators which respect and follow the parameters of the network as they were established through the governance, by the community. Keep your stake safe by choosing technically competent validators.

## Vote

By voting **YES** to this proposal, you agree to change the MaxValidators parameter from 135 to 150, allowing 15 new validators to enter the set.

By voting **NO** to this proposal, you disagree with increasing the validator set and prefer keeping the current MaxValidator value of 135.

By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their 500 JUNO deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.

Komple Framework, KompleJS & Marketplace Builder Proposal
Voting Start: Tue, 20 Sep 2022 19:46:34 UTC

👍 67.93%, 👎 12.24%, 🕊️ 19.78%, ❌ 0.03% \n
This is a heavily truncated version of the Komple Framework, KompleJS & Marketplace Builder Proposal. 

Please read the full length IPFS proposal  here https://bafybeiftfnekil5tcru5zohydiwfoz3yzzgqtvhj3id6tbj6b3jch3ri7i.ipfs.nftstorage.link ⚠️ . 

# Introduction 

We at Komple have experience working with wasm smart contracts and are committed to pushing the technology to its limits. 

With Komple, we aim to utilize the potential of Juno Network and CosmWasm by developing new open-source tools for NFT based applications, making them more accessible to the community. 

# Komple Framework & KompleJS 

View documentation  here https://docs.komple.io ⚠️ . 
Make sure to check out our documentation website for more in-depth information. 

Komple Framework is a smart contract framework developed with CosmWasm to build out NFT based applications. 

Containing different modules such as merge module, dynamic metadata module, p2p swap module and even accommodating custom modules developed by the community, Komple Framework gives developers the tools they need to bring their projects to life. 

With KompleJS, developing Javascript applications is easier than ever. It is tightly integrated with Komple Framework releases. 

# Community-Centric Marketplace Builder 

Our community-centric marketplace builder allows for projects to build and configure their own marketplaces without needing to touch a single line of code. 

We call this tool Marbu. 

Marbu allows DAOs, projects and individuals to shape their projects based on their custom needs. 

With the use of modularity and contract interactions made possible by the Komple Framework, all projects within Marbu will have the ability to collaborate, scale up and put creativity first. 

While having the tools for such things, projects and Juno community will also benefit from the secondary sale fees - extracting the value they are bringing. 

Simply, Marbu aims to be the home of NFT based applications on Juno Network. 

# Project Timeline 

Komple is asking for a total of 320K USD from Juno community. This is to be released gradually, based on projects development and milestone progress. 

The milestone system enables a social contract between us and the Juno community. We need to prove ourselves at each milestone. 

At the time of this proposal going live, 320K USD is equal to 65440 JUNO. 

We've split this process into 4 milestones. 

## Milestone 1: 
**Time: 2 months - 80K USD** 

Initial 40K USD released immediately for kickstarting operations. 

Remaining 40K USD will be taken after completing these points: 

* Having v1.0.0 of Komple Framework. Hub, Mint, Token, Metadata, Marketplace, Whitelist, Merge, and Permission modules. 
* Having Marbu initial website designs ready to build. 
* Having Komple Framework testing website designs. 

## Milestone 2: 
**Time: 2 months - 80K USD** 

*Having v1.0.0 of KompleJS based on v1.0.0 of Komple Framework. 
Having a live Komple Framework testing website for developers, ready to test out applications built with Komple Framework. 
Starting the Marbu website development. 

## Milestone 3: 
**Time: 1 month - 80K USD** 

* Having the beta version for Marbu website deployed on testnet. 
* Having the incentivized bug bounties on Marbu website. 

## Milestone 4: 
**Time 1 month - 80K USD** 

* Finishing the Marbu website and successfully deploying on mainnet. 

# Vote 

By voting **YES**, you agree for 65440 JUNO to be allocated to a multi-sig address (juno1t77h5j4e9rqdpqxtm3ykhrly6td5yp7j9mpn703eyy666kfwf7nquhkmta) managed by **Dimi (C-Root)**, **Max (C-Root)** and **Arda (Komple)** to be released based on milestone completion. 

By voting **NO**, you disagree to allocate the requested amount to develop mentioned projects. 

By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal. 

By voting **NOWITHVETO**, you seek penalizing the proposal depositors by burning their deposit of 1000 JUNO, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold, which would result in proposal failure if reached.

**max_gas** is a parameter which defines the maximum total gas allowed for each block.

It is important to set the value of the parameter suitably to balance between the transaction amount per block and the computational load on the validator nodes.

The Juno dev team has been testing configuration changes, and concluded that the parameter can be reduced without disrupting developers or existing contracts. Following the v10 upgrade, the team are proposing to change **max_gas** to **10000000**

"Decrease per block gas limit

## Reduce Maximum Gas

**max_gas** is a parameter which defines the maximum total gas allowed for each block.

It is important to set the value of the parameter suitably to balance between the transaction amount per block and the computational load on the validator nodes.

The Juno dev team has been testing configuration changes, and concluded that the parameter can be reduced without disrupting developers or existing contracts. Following the v10 upgrade, the team are proposing to change **max_gas** to **10000000**

Implement a fee-sharing mechanism

## TL;DR\nImplement a fee-sharing mechanism, where half of the transaction fee of a smart contract execution will go to the contract’s recipient address which is defaulted to the creator address, and the other half will go to stakers as per usual.\nThe proposed mechanism can potentially become a permanent incentive source for developers based on the raised user activity, in the form of executions, towards their developed smart contract.\n## Introduction\nJunø is the go-to smart contract zone in the ecosystem, due to its permissionless interoperability and lively community.\nOne of the main keys to grow and expand the core value of a smart contract platform is reflected by the applications and projects built on it, besides to the developers/contributors.\nTherefore, we intend to seek ways and methods to attract healthy development on Junø and promote the effectiveness behind adopting our platform to launch web3 applications. Such methods included offering grants, Hack Juno rewards, or community-pool based funding approved via governance.\nBut what if the chain offered built-in incentives for development on Junø? Will it attract further development and contributors to begin landing on Junø?\n## Contributor Fee-Based Incentives\nThe proposed solution is constructed around rewarding developers based on the overall user interest in what has been developed, which is potentially a longterm continuous reward.\nFor each smart contract, there will be a fee recipient address which is defaulted to the creator address.\nThe fee split parameter would be configurable via governance. As of now, we propose a 50/50% split.\nFor each transaction which executes the smart contract, 50% of the transaction fee is distributed to the fee recipient address. The remaining 50% is distributed to stakers.\nThis mechanism allows developers to be fairly rewarded as long as their development is raising activity and users are transacting with their smart contract. Fee distribution will not require voting or permission, and acts as longterm potential revenue, which can attract more developers to build on Junø.\n## How Contributor Incentives can commend DAOs\nOne of the optimistic outcomes will be the integration between DAO treasuries and on-chain smart contracts, where the treasury address can be the contract’s fee recipient address to receive fee-based incentives.\nFor example, JunoSwap can set the RAW DAO treasury as the contributor address, where 50% of the fees collected by JunoSwap transactions will be automatically received by the RAW DAO.\n## Postscript\nThis is a signaling proposal to evaluate the community’s interest in the proposed “Contributor Fee-Based Incentives” mechanism. Accordingly, the dev team will begin working on the implementation.\nThe proposed mechanism will not reduce or exclude the presence of other incentive programs such as Hack Juno, grants, or governance-approved funding.\n## Voting\n* By voting **YES** on this proposal, you agree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented.\n* By voting **NO** on this proposal, you disagree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented.\n* By voting **NO WITH VETO**, you disagree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented, and additionally intend to contribute towards proposal rejection and burning of proposal deposit if NoWithVeto votes are greater than a third of voting power.\n* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you decline to give an opinion on the proposition.

# Implement Price Oracle on Juno\n\nThis is a signaling proposal regarding the implementation of an on-chain Price Oracle to Juno.\n\nCommonwealth Proposal and Discussions can be seen  here https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7325-oracle ⚠️  and  here https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7751-implement-price-oracle-on-juno.\n\n### ⚠️  Pros\n\n- A Price Oracle supports many DeFi use cases that are currently difficult (or impossible) to implement on Juno. Many major DeFi protocols depend upon decentralized price feeds to function correctly. This is a rapid solution to provide that functionality.\n- Currently, projects on Juno wanting to access price feeds have to pay excessive fees to access these feeds, which can be prohibitive for a start-up.\n- Implementing a Price Oracle on Juno natively would give Juno (and the community) control over this public good.\n- Even if better solutions come along, this is a rapidly implementable stop-gap solution that can be deployed. Future oracles and providers may improve upon this service.\n- Juno would be the first *permissionless* CosmWasm chain with an on-chain Price Oracle, which is a valid differentiator for builders seeking to deploy DeFi protocols in a permissionless environment.\n\n### Cons\n\n- Validators will have to run additional software to ensure the price oracle is decentralized. Failure to do so will result in soft-slashing, so Juno stakers and validators face a non-zero risk of soft-slashing. Soft-slashing is set at 0.01 ⚠️ % on Juno. *(The slashing window is an adjustable parameter and will be set conservatively at first to allow validators to gain software familiarity.)*\n- Some blockchains have already added price oracles, though none are permissionless.

 It has 2.5 ⚠️  million Juno instead of 50k (Which was the max per account)  

 One of the main reasons for this proposal is that this address has staked the majority to one validator. This action is centralizing the network. They also did not delegate until Juno started trading on Osmosis. This would indicate that it was done so that it would be impossible to just restart the chain with this amount changed to 50k. 

  They just started to redelegate 250k Juno to SG1, which is the second biggest validator I can only assume because of the backlash. SG1 is the 2nd biggest validator so they don’t seem to understand the concept of decentralization. By not fixing this issue now it will lead to long term centralized governance issues. 

 I propose that we blacklist/delete 90% of the Juno in this account. This action is not done lightly. By the time this proposal goes through, they will not have been able to undelegate in time to prevent the decision of governance. 

 By voting yes to this proposal you agree that the Juno tokens in this account be reduced by 90% and that  future blacklisting/reducing of coins should not be taken lightly.

This proposal is intended to further bootstrap Juno liquidity on the Osmosis AMM.

By voting YES on this proposal, 250,000 JUNO from the community pool will be allocated to the JUNO/XKI pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

Allocate 250,000 JUNO to LPs on the JUNO/XKI pool
Distribution: 1388 JUNO/Per day for 180 days

The Ki Foundation will be matching this proposal with 6,250,000 XKI to LPs on the JUNO/XKI pool.
Distribution: 34722 XKI/Per day for 180 days.

Effectively the JUNO/XKI pool would have at least triple incentives:
1. Juno bonus incentives,
2. XKI bonus incentives,
3. Swap fees.

Should proposal #76 pass ( https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/76 ⚠️  ), the JUNO/XKI pool would have a unique quadruple incentives:
1. OSMO bonus incentives,
2. Juno bonus incentives,
3. XKI bonus incentives,
4. Swap fees.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s ⚠️  )

** IMPORTANT **

The requested funds will be sent to a ledger wallet set up and managed by Dimi (juno1x3zhtluc2vlt9n0szynhur06s07f6y609h429r) that will provide technical assistance in the creation of the gauges for incentives, funds will be allocated to the JUNO/XKI pair ONLY when the exact $ amount in bonus incentives is matched by the Ki Foundation.

Should for whatever reason the matching not be possible, requested funds would be deposited back into the Juno community pool.

** About Ki & Klub **

"This proposal is intended to further bootstrap Juno liquidity on the Osmosis AMM.

By voting YES on this proposal, 250,000 JUNO from the community pool will be allocated to the JUNO/XKI pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

Allocate 250,000 JUNO to LPs on the JUNO/XKI pool
Distribution: 1388 JUNO/Per day for 180 days

The Ki Foundation will be matching this proposal with 6,250,000 XKI to LPs on the JUNO/XKI pool.
Distribution: 34722 XKI/Per day for 180 days.

Effectively the JUNO/XKI pool would have at least triple incentives:
1. Juno bonus incentives,
2. XKI bonus incentives,
3. Swap fees.

Should proposal #76 pass ( https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/76 ), the JUNO/XKI pool would have a unique quadruple incentives:
1. OSMO bonus incentives,
2. Juno bonus incentives,
3. XKI bonus incentives,
4. Swap fees.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s )

** IMPORTANT **

The requested funds will be sent to a ledger wallet set up and managed by Dimi (juno1x3zhtluc2vlt9n0szynhur06s07f6y609h429r) that will provide technical assistance in the creation of the gauges for incentives, funds will be allocated to the JUNO/XKI pair ONLY when the exact $ amount in bonus incentives is matched by the Ki Foundation.

Should for whatever reason the matching not be possible, requested funds would be deposited back into the Juno community pool.

JunoSwap Signaling Proposal: Allow permissionless listing of bridged assets from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge
Voting Start: Wed, 23 Feb 2022 16:44:09 UTC
Voting End: Mon, 28 Feb 2022 16:44:09 UTC
👍 22.14%, 👎 42.34%, 🕊️ 35.13%, ❌ 0.37% \n
This is a basic signaling proposal to all JUNO stakers for them to signal their support for or dissent against allowing the permissionless listing of Sifchain’s bridged peggy assets on JunoSwap. 

This proposal is being put on chain for all JUNO stakers to vote on after an 8 day long discussion period in the commonwealth and in lieu of official governance mechanisms on JunoSwap DAO, which are expected to launch alongside the RAW airdrop.   

Summary:
By voting “yes” on this proposal, Juno stakers signal their support for allowing tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge to be listed on JunoSwap. 

By voting “no” on this proposal, Juno stakers signal their dissent against allowing tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge to be listed on JunoSwap.

Context:
Sifchain’s recent Magnolia upgrade has made ERC20 tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge IBC compatible. This makes it possible to transfer ETH or any ERC20 token from Peggy to JunoSwap, enabling such pairs as JUNO:ETH and JUNO:RNDR. 

In the very near future, Sifchain will soon upgrade peggy to Omni-EVM, which will enable quick deployment of EVM bridges, and enable token pairs on JunoSwap such as JUNO:NEAR and JUNO:SOL.

Benefits:
Enabling assets from different, secure bridges, ensures that users of JunoSwap will not be limited by the token-selection of only one bridge. This is relevant because many innovative bridge solutions will launch in Cosmos, and being limited to only one bridge will reduce the amount of assets that can be swapped on JunoSwap – thus sending users elsewhere to make swaps.  

While it has been argued by other DEXes that this makes UX unpleasant, there are many work arounds to this. For example, truly permissionless listings for all assets have not stopped UniSwap from achieving over $10B in TVL. Improvements to UX are as simple as implementing a manage-tokens toggle (appended below).    

If this Proposal Passes:
The community supports the permissionless listing of assets that come from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge. 

Additional Information  :
In order to ensure that conflicts-of-interest do not play a role in the outcomes of this proposal, we would encourage any validators that have a vested interest in the success of another bridge and choose to vote to:  

a) state their biases
 b) abstain

👍 15.2%, 👎 34.87%, 🕊️ 6.02%, ❌ 43.9% \n
This is a signaling proposal offering a compromise to the problems presented in  Prop 4 https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/4 ⚠️  and  Prop 16 https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/16 ⚠️ .

CCN clients have agreed in advance by majority to support this compromise.

By voting YES, the Juno stakers voice their support

- To split All JUNO including staking rewards in  the address https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8 ⚠️  equally between the ""Community"" (50%) and ""CCN Clients"" (50%)

The funds will be allocated as follows:
- The ""Community Portion"" of JUNO allocated to a smart contract governed by the community.  Distribution will be determined through subsequent governance proposals
- The ""CCN Client Portion"" of JUNO to be distributed by CCN to CCN client addresses at a rate of 5% per month over 20 months.

This compromise ensures:
- The sanctity of funds in Juno Blockchain wallets is not violated as allocation is agreed by all parties (including original fund holders)
- Signals to future large JUNO holders that their funds will be honored and safe
- Ensures that the Juno community will gain governance power equal to that distributed to CCN clients

Confirmation by CCN to agree to Unity Prop

This proposal signals that a neutral Third Party Auditor, who confirms the identities of CCN clients via standard KYC systems, confirms the proper amount of JUNO for distribution to each address, and confirms the proper wallet addresses for distribution would be sufficient basis to approve fund withdrawals from the Smart Contract as specified in  the Unity Prop https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/4102-prop-17-unity-win-win-win ⚠️ .

CCN is currently reviewing possible Auditors which can validate that distributions of JUNO only go to valid CCN clients, who are real people, who are in full control of their wallets, of the proper amount based on their investment.

This neutral and independent Audit will help the community confirm that CCN clients are real individuals and ensures that funds only go to real people (and not fake wallets owned by CCN).

CCN Seeks early community sentiment on whether this effort will be acceptable prior to contracting an external Auditing Team.

A vote for Yes means that you agree to proceed with distribution to the CCN clients’ addresses if they are substantiated through a neutral third-party audit.

A vote for No means that you disagree to proceed with distribution to the CCN clients’ addresses even if it is substantiated through a neutral third-party audit.

The third-party (institution) will clarify as follows:
- Confirm which CCN clients had paid for CCN service by February 18, 2021
- Clarify the number of JUNO that each client can receive
- Ensure the client passes KYC
- Ensure the client has control of the receiving wallet address

The process after the lock will be as follows:
- Create a smart contract based on CosmWasm merkle-drop, modified to handle native tokens
- Import all the addresses that passed KYC in the smart contract
- Send funds from unity contract to new one
- Allocate tokens proportionally, let CCN clients withdraw independently from CCN

This proposal provides initial incentives for pools.\n\nIt sets the initial distribution of incentives allocation points. It allocates 5% of the LP incentives to the community pool.\n\nThe rest is based upon the current TVL for each pool. ATOM/OSMO has the most liquidity, so we have it at 25%. For the remaining pools, we split the incentives evenly between the ATOM and OSMO pools.

This proposal provides an upgrade to the current OSMO incentives for liquidity pools to account for the addition of the REGEN pools into the OSMOSIS DEX, following the successful Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool. This proposal is built on the back of proposal 2, and aims to bring OSMO incentives to the REGEN pairs in line with the incentives offered to the other pools.\n\nWe propose that the total number of points allocated per Epoch is increase by 12% and that those points are distributed evenly to the REGEN/ATOM pool (#22) and the REGEN/OSMO pool (#42).\nWe propose that the 5% allocation to the community pool stays the same, and that the 2% allocation to the ION pool stays the same, and that the rest of the pools are diluted to accommodate this additional 12%.\n\nAll other parameters, including time lock incentives would extend to the REGEN pools as well.

Proposal 6, a proposal that got passed offering a change in incentives distributions in order to include Regen pools, had a data entry error that differed from the proposal text.

This highlights the need for more tooling and standards being set here for ensuring that any manual adjustments to OSMO pool incentives get much more auditability.\n\nProposal 6 was passed in the last epoch at the time of this proposal's writing. This proposal offers a governance proposal to align the ratios with what was proposed in proposal 6, except with the following modification:\n\nThe Community pool allocation from LP incentives is lowered from 5% to 1%, with the remaining 4% being distributed evenly across all pools with lower than expected allocations per the text of prop 6.\nThis is namely every incentivized pool, except for the OSMO/ION, ATOM/REGEN, and OSMO/REGEN.\nThis is done as a means of accounting for the lower than expected rewards in the interrim. Please note that the baseline 5% of community pool rewards from minting is unchanged\n\nAlternatively, the community could equally vote on a new incentives distribution, such as is proposed in proposal 8, or a new proposal based on current TVL similar to proposal 2.\n\n One important thing to remark is that it is plausible that this proposal and proposal 8 both enter their voting period during the same epoch.

Distribute LP rewards for epoch that ended at 2021-06-23 (Revised)

👍 94.65%, 👎 3.35%, 🕊️ 1.95%, ❌ 0.03% \n
TL;DR:
We propose to distribute LP rewards for the epoch that ended at 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC to those that were bonded just before 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC.

Proposal:
This proposal seeks to equitably reward early liquidity providers (""ELPs"") who failed to receive the liquidity mining rewards that were communicated by the Osmosis Team. Proposal #2 for initiation of liquidity mining incentives for bonded liquidity providers passed on 2021-06-23 16:52 UTC. Prior to Proposal #2 passing, the Osmosis Team issued the following message: ""Note that users can begin bonding their LP tokens even though liquidity incentives haven’t been enabled yet, and their first LP reward will be distributed at 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC.""
Discord link: https://discord.com/channels/798583171548840026/842477665860583434/856777198442774569 ⚠️ 
Skylink: https://skygallery.hns.skyportal.xyz/#/a/AABDv3g-2RYw1FbuF8BDn2yKyjS_5jMOrSVkS-KdWTQfoQ ⚠️ 

Based upon that and other messages, the community (including the Osmosis Team) believed that ELPs would receive their portion of the newly initiated liquidity mining rewards at the close of that epoch. ELPs assumed significant risk by providing liquidity and bonding their tokens at a time when overall liquidity on Osmosis was a small fraction of what it is today. Unfortunately, ELPs received no rewards for their service. The Osmosis Team acknowledges this miscommunication and recommended that the community submit a governance proposal to distribute the rewards from the community pool to ELPs. ELPs experienced substantial impermanent loss, price slippage, and lost opportunity cost of capital. ELPs rightfully expected liquidity rewards for these risks by providing the earliest and most important liquidity on the platform, especially considering the miscommunication from the Osmosis Team. Instead, ELPs performed worse than those who retained liquid capital and bonded later when there was less risk, less slippage and more volume (at the expense of ELPs). This result is inequitable and contrary to the ethos of Osmosis.

Should this proposal pass, the liquidity rewards will be distributed to applicable recipients from the community pool after a future software upgrade performed by the Osmosis Team. We thank you for your consideration.

Note:
This proposal is a revision of proposal #11, which proposed to distribute 20% of the rewards to current LPs. Following discussions with community members (particularly on Discord), a strong opinion was that a 20% concession would set a bad precedent. The issue is that, regardless of what the intention is, rewarding other LPs in this context is essentially vote buying. We strongly believe that proposals for community spending should be free of bribes.

This proposal would lower the minimum deposit for governance proposals from the current 2500 Osmos, to 500 Osmos. The Cosmos hub currently has a minimum deposit of 64 Atoms, at the current exchange rate between Atoms and Osmos (1 Atom to 7.196 ⚠️  Osmo) this is equivalent to ~460 Osmos.

Double the block gas limits

This proposal increases the block gas limit to 120M, from the existing 60M. 

We are currently frequently hitting block gas limits, even though the native execution times remain quite low. We see that we're frequently getting 10-20 trades per block, with block's nearing the gas limit. (Due to several affects, not just low gas limit, but the gas limit is still a part of it)

Furthermore, the bonding & unbonding of LP shares for yield farming still takes a lot of gas, even though its fixed in the subsequent chain software version. Bonding of LP shares is nearing 30M gas per tx (until the next upgrade). For unbonding it depends on how many locks its trying to unbond at once. (~25M each atm) Increasing the limit should improve UX, without notably increasing the block times. In the future, if we find that we're getting into execution time limits per block, we should start tuning per-tx gas parameters and optimizing the code to improve these speeds. The chain should _absolutely_ be able to support 100+ trades per block, and we need our gas limits to be able to reflect this. I propose that only if the chain starts seeing too high of an execution time per block, and a software patch would take too long, do we start tuning down the block gas limit.

As Prop 22 was the first of the LP incentive adjustment proposals to receive significant opposition, we feel that it should be abandoned and allowed to fail, as passing with a very slim majority would be contentious. As such, we are creating this proposal to decide the question of adding incentives to IOV pools, separate from the regular adjustments.\n\nIf you feel that IOV pools should enter the pool onboarding process proposed in https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposal/discussion/1534-adding-incentives-to-new-pools-using-the-prop-13-model ⚠️  then please vote Yes.\n\nIf you oppose the use of this model to add incentives for IOV pools please vote No.\n\nA new regular incentive adjustment proposal will be created on 8/23/2021, with the scale parameter lowered back down to 15%, as there was also significant opposition to the 20% level.\n\n If this proposal passes, IOV pools 183 and 197 will be added to that proposal, if this vote fails, they will not be added.

Remove the proposer bonus lottery

👍 96.42%, 👎 3.05%, 🕊️ 0.5%, ❌ 0.01% \n
Parameter change proposal to set baseproposerreward & bonusproposerreward params to ZERO to remove the undesireable centralization incentive it creates.\n\nThere is a detailed writeup on the  Osmosis Commonwealth why we should pass this proposal : https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/1688-remove-the-proposer-bonus-lottery\n\n****REPRINTED ⚠️  BELOW****\nCurrently 1-5% of epoch rewards go to the validator (and their delegators) who proposed the epoch block. The exact percentage depends on details of how many validators were counted as online at the epoch block. This is an unfair system for a number of reasons, and introduces a force to centralize stake amongst the validators who already have the most stake. This is because:\n\n1. (In theory) The chance of a validator being the proposer is proportional to their stake, which means you have the same expected return, but lower variance with larger validators. This gives an incentive to delegate to the largest validators. (There is a similar effect in POW mining systems like Bitcoin, which leads to pools)\n2. In practice, the chance of a validator being the epoch proposer is 0 if they are not in the top 66% (by stake) of fastest validators. Only the validators who finish computing the block first will be potential proposers for it. This also contributes to centralization, as the largest validators can most afford to maximize their speed.\n3. The proposer selection algorithm is not based on secure randomness, it isn’t even random at all. It is in fact highly manipulable. There are known strategies validator operators could use to attempt to propose a specific block. Actual usage of these strategies could be considered byzantine behavior, and could lead to further network instability around the epoch time.\n\nThis centralization effect is harmful to the long term success of the network – we want the stake distribution to become much less top heavy. Stake distribution has been decentralizing nicely as time has gone in the network, but it would be ideal to further accelerate this decentralization. And whats critical to that, is at minimum, lowering the incentive for the stake to centralize at the top. We are nowhere near the end state yet for stake distribution!\n\n--Short Term Suggestion--\n\nCreate a parameter change proposal to set the proposer bonus to 0%.

Clawback ALL unclaimed ION & OSMO to Community Pool after airdrop decay period?
Voting Start: Mon, 06 Sep 2021 05:17:07 UTC
Voting End: Thu, 09 Sep 2021 05:17:07 UTC
👍 94.89%, 👎 3.8%, 🕊️ 1.29%, ❌ 0% \n
The passing of Prop #29 generated plenty of further community discussion on how to go about enacting a clawback and how to utilize it. This proposal seeks to build upon the initial consensus achieved and separate the vote on an execution framework for a clawback from any specific uses for clawedback tokens.\n\n***Reminder***\n'Unclaimed' tokens are defined as being in wallets which have a Sequence Number = 0, which means the address has NOT performed a single action during the 6 month airdrop claim window.\n\n******CLAWBACK PROPOSED FRAMEWORK******\nTLDR -- Send ALL unclaimed ION & OSMO back to the community pool and prune those inactive wallets from current state.\n\nThis proposal has three key updates to highlight from the prior proposal:

1)  This is to vote for ALL unclaimed Ion be clawedback, not just 80% as was suggested in Prop #29 as an approach to synchronize Ion/Osmo airdrops.\n2)  Clawing back the 20% of OSMO which sit in inactive wallets has been included.  Reclaiming the idle stagnating OSMO's to support the future betterment of the Osmosis Zone seems a logical extension of the consensus to clawback unclaimed Ions.  This also will keep the airdrops in alignment where both are reclaimed entirely at the end of the decay window.\n3)  Pruning of the addresses from state makes complete sense because they will be totally empty and would otherwise just be unnecessarily requiring storage space.

# Osmosis v4 Berylium Chain Upgrade\n\n\n\nRendered: https://hackmd.io/L2dgE1yJT22uP8bgHXnZLg?view\n\n\n\nThis ⚠️  upgrade is a large stability upgrade to Osmosis. It brings with it faster epochs, and improved computation time for various on-chain operations, and fixes to the high gas amounts needed for bonding and unbonding txs.\n\n\n\nThe features of this upgrade are:\n\n\n\n* Fixing gas issues for bonding and unbonding tokens (NOTE: issues at epoch of there just being super high amounts of activity may still persist, with it taking seconds for txs to get into a block)\n\n* Removing the need for users to withdraw locked tokens once they are finished unlocking\n\n* Adding a governance parameter for a minimum fee to create a pool.\n\n* Implements prop 12\n\n\n\nSee more in the  changelog https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v4.0.0/CHANGELOG.md\n\n\n\n### ⚠️  Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\n\n\nFollow the cosmovisor setup instructions here: https://github.com/osmosis-labs/networks/blob/main/osmosis-1/upgrades/cosmovisor.md\n\n\n\nNamely ⚠️ , configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the osmosisd v4.0.0 binary to .osmosisd/cosmovisor/v4/bin/.\n\n\n\n### Details of upgrade time\n\n\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine of the Osmosis will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to v4.0.0, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\n\n\nThe proposal sets the upgrade proposal block at #1314500, which\n\nis anticipated to be at Friday 2PM UTC (10AM EST). This is figured using the 7 day average block time of 6.45 ⚠️  seconds per block. Note that block times are highly variable, and this time estimate could very well be off by a couple of hours, due to live network conditions.\n\n\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\n\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node.

By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for adding osmo incentives to JUNO on Osmosis.

**Details**

The following proposal is a basic signaling proposal to include JUNO pairs into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.

Regular JUNO/OSMO and JUNO/ATOM pools will go live on Osmosis AMM shortly after Juno's October 1st mainnet launch.

When the pools are first created on Osmosis, they will not be incentivized. 10-13 days after pools creation, if this signaling proposal is passed, the pools will be added to the regular incentive update proposal through the onboarding process.

Furthermore a proposal will go live on the Juno mainnet to request community pool funding to boost the above mentioned pairs and to contribute to a potential allocation by the Osmosis Hub.

Proposal: Sponsor 4,000 OSMO to the Cosmoverse 2021 Conference in Lisbon?

Description
Cosmoverse 2021 (https://cosmoverse.org/ ⚠️ ) is a community-led conference that will take place in Lisbon, Portugal on November 5th, 2021. Due to unprecedented demand, we are going to expand the conference for an additional day, turning it into a two-day conference from November 5-6.

Objective
Cosmoverse is held to raise awareness of Cosmos and its vibrant ecosystem. Hundreds of Cosmonauts from all over the world will unite to learn and network at Cosmoverse.
The team:

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

During late October and early November, Lisbon is going to be full with Crypto-specific events and conferences.

Cosmoverse takes place in between ETH Lisbon and Solana, which means that attendees from these events will have the opportunity to join us, too.

Livestream
For those that are unable to attend, there will be a livestream broadcasting of the event, in collaboration with OmniFlix. A professional camera setup and videographers are already arranged. We will create specific in-stream content in advance to provide a seamless experience for online-viewers.
Event Highlights
Cosmoverse is organized by the community, for the community. We managed to onboard reputable speakers from the Cosmos ecosystem, such as Sunny Aggarwal, Billy Rennekamp, Alessio Treglia, Federico Kunze-Küllmer, Brent Xu, Gregory Landua or Felix Lutsch, but also high-profile speakers from the broader Cryptoverse such as Meltem Demirors, Tegan Kline, Marc Zeller and more.

As we get closer to the event, we will try to embed more exciting things that will make Cosmoverse a great success. Follow us on Twitter and join the chat on Telegram to stay up-to-date and STAY TUNED :)


Budget & post-conference report

If this proposal passes, 4,000 OSMO (worth ~ $20,000 as of today according to Coingecko) will be allocated to help make this event a great success.

The lead sponsor for the conference is the Cosmos Hub with marketing funds from proposal #46 “Luna Mission,” but we require additional resources to pay for:
Audio visuals / logistics
Day 2 venue + catering

Afterparty
Printing banners
Marketing materials
Online marketing and coverage
We are going to publish a detailed report on the budget-spent after the conference occurred. Given that Cosmoverse was just an idea ~5 weeks ago and things are moving incredibly fast, the cost and budget planning is one of the hardest tasks for us at the moment.

In addition, given that we are just a team of 6-enthusiastic Cosmonauts without a company that could bail us out, we need to be incredibly cautious with our finances and avoid illiquidity.

The main cost-factors for this event (for 320 people) are:
Venue incl. catering: ~ $36,500 per day
AV + branding: ~ $34,200 total
Afterparty: ~ $20,000
Additional expenses: tbd
Team expenses: tbd
Team compensation: tbd

The cost for the venue would increase by ~$19,000 per day if we could host 500 guests instead of 320.

In case there is going to be a profit left, we plan to use this as starting liquidity for the next Cosmoverse conference.

Current sponsors are:
Cosmos Hub community pool ($34,000)
Citizen Cosmos ($5,000)
Stargaze ($5,000)
Sentinel ($5,000)
Regen Network ($5,000)
Umee ($5,000)
e-Money ($5,000)
Commercio ($5,000)

Cosmoverse is a community-effort that is financed in a hybrid manner by companies and DAOs. The first one ever? In the future, we envision Cosmoverse to become a fully DAO-funded endeavor that will take place annually.


Tickets
The goal is also to keep the ticket prices extremely affordable (from 39€) which is very competitive to other crypto-conferences happening in Lisbon around the same time (tickets cost up to €1,000). The ticket also includes F&B throughout both days at the conference as well as access and F&B at the afterparty venue. Our goal is to provide as much value as possible for attending Cosmonauts, while also investing funds into media coverage to provide high-quality, free broadcasting of the event. Each presentation will also be recorded and published on Youtube.

The Osmosis core team has been an early proponent and supporter of Cosmoverse and is also receiving exposure at the event.
If the proposal is accepted, Osmosis will become a sponsor of Cosmoverse 2021.

This includes:
Online and print visibility
Keynote slot on Day 1 (presentation by Josh Lee)
Panel slot on Day 2 (topic + panelists tbd)
1x high table at the conference in the exhibition area
1x stand up banner placed in the networking area
Promotion in relevant news outlets

During late October and early November, Lisbon is going to be full with Crypto-specific events and conferences.

Cosmoverse takes place in between ETH Lisbon and Solana, which means that attendees from these events will have the opportunity to join us, too.

Livestream
For those that are unable to attend, there will be a livestream broadcasting of the event, in collaboration with OmniFlix. A professional camera setup and videographers are already arranged. We will create specific in-stream content in advance to provide a seamless experience for online-viewers.
Event Highlights
Cosmoverse is organized by the community, for the community. We managed to onboard reputable speakers from the Cosmos ecosystem, such as Sunny Aggarwal, Billy Rennekamp, Alessio Treglia, Federico Kunze-Küllmer, Brent Xu, Gregory Landua or Felix Lutsch, but also high-profile speakers from the broader Cryptoverse such as Meltem Demirors, Tegan Kline, Marc Zeller and more.

As we get closer to the event, we will try to embed more exciting things that will make Cosmoverse a great success. Follow us on Twitter and join the chat on Telegram to stay up-to-date and STAY TUNED :)


Budget & post-conference report

If this proposal passes, 4,000 OSMO (worth ~ $20,000 as of today according to Coingecko) will be allocated to help make this event a great success.

The lead sponsor for the conference is the Cosmos Hub with marketing funds from proposal #46 “Luna Mission,” but we require additional resources to pay for:
Audio visuals / logistics
Day 2 venue + catering

Afterparty
Printing banners
Marketing materials
Online marketing and coverage
We are going to publish a detailed report on the budget-spent after the conference occurred. Given that Cosmoverse was just an idea ~5 weeks ago and things are moving incredibly fast, the cost and budget planning is one of the hardest tasks for us at the moment.

In addition, given that we are just a team of 6-enthusiastic Cosmonauts without a company that could bail us out, we need to be incredibly cautious with our finances and avoid illiquidity.

The main cost-factors for this event (for 320 people) are:
Venue incl. catering: ~ $36,500 per day
AV + branding: ~ $34,200 total
Afterparty: ~ $20,000
Additional expenses: tbd
Team expenses: tbd
Team compensation: tbd

The cost for the venue would increase by ~$19,000 per day if we could host 500 guests instead of 320.

In case there is going to be a profit left, we plan to use this as starting liquidity for the next Cosmoverse conference.

Current sponsors are:
Cosmos Hub community pool ($34,000)
Citizen Cosmos ($5,000)
Stargaze ($5,000)
Sentinel ($5,000)
Regen Network ($5,000)
Umee ($5,000)
e-Money ($5,000)
Commercio ($5,000)

Cosmoverse is a community-effort that is financed in a hybrid manner by companies and DAOs. The first one ever? In the future, we envision Cosmoverse to become a fully DAO-funded endeavor that will take place annually.


Tickets
The goal is also to keep the ticket prices extremely affordable (from 39€) which is very competitive to other crypto-conferences happening in Lisbon around the same time (tickets cost up to €1,000). The ticket also includes F&B throughout both days at the conference as well as access and F&B at the afterparty venue. Our goal is to provide as much value as possible for attending Cosmonauts, while also investing funds into media coverage to provide high-quality, free broadcasting of the event. Each presentation will also be recorded and published on Youtube.

The Osmosis core team has been an early proponent and supporter of Cosmoverse and is also receiving exposure at the event.
If the proposal is accepted, Osmosis will become a sponsor of Cosmoverse 2021.

This includes:
Online and print visibility
Keynote slot on Day 1 (presentation by Josh Lee)
Panel slot on Day 2 (topic + panelists tbd)
1x high table at the conference in the exhibition area
1x stand up banner placed in the networking area

Add Incentive Matching to Prop 13 Model

👍 99.28%, 👎 0.38%, 🕊️ 0.32%, ❌ 0% \n
I propose that we extend the model currently used for semi-automatic incentive adjustments to include an Incentive Matching program, where we match external incentives paid to liquidity pools on Osmosis. Such as the previous program by Akash, current one by E-Money, and proposed one by Juno https://juno.aneka.io/proposals/1\n\nUnder ⚠️  the current process, new pool creators are asked to create Text Proposals so that we can come to consensus about whether or not these pools should begin receiving Osmo incentives following the Prop 13 model and on-boarding process.\n\nUnder the proposed new process, pool creators would create Text Proposals asking for governance agreement to add the pools to the model, but also to match a certain amount of external incentives that they plan to provide. For an approved pool with external incentives, the model would set a minimum incentive share with Osmo to match the USD value of the external incentives.\n\nThese incentive matches would be decided by governance on a case by case basis, and should be limited to some overall % of Osmo Incentives. I propose that we start with a soft limit of 20% of incentives, so matching no more than ~400,000 USD per day of external incentives.\n\nI also propose that we begin by matching the external incentives currently being paid by E-Money to pools 461, and 482. As well as the proposed Juno incentives on pools 497, and 498. These external incentives amount to a total of ~36,000 USD per day, or 1.9 ⚠️ % of incentives at current prices.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, we will begin using the new spreadsheet for regular adjustment proposals starting October 11th 2021, and these pools will have their external incentives at least matched.\n\nIf this proposal is not approved, we will continue with the Prop 13 model without matching. As Juno pools are already approved for incentives, they will begin on-boarding regardless of which outcome is decided here.\n\nCurrent Spreadsheet:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15-b7o4QHY4SNE7Cw6MSZZ9Xxxbwca_hw4coLN9Y2ZFM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nProposed ⚠️  Spreadsheet:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ruG_ZypTPZ9myr2ov5atclfCNRTPGoMYbStYqnVcf1c/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThis ⚠️  spreadsheet implements the proposed changes.

👍 86.78%, 👎 1.47%, 🕊️ 11.45%, ❌ 0.28% \n
By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:Adding Osmo incentives to IXO/OSMO and IXO/ATOM pools (to be created) through the current process.\n.\n\n**Details**\n\nThe following proposal is a basic signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to include IXO pairs into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives. Regular IXO/OSMO and IXO/ATOM pools will go live on Osmosis AMM as soon as the proposal is accepted and in accordance with Osmosis rules, then, exact date will be announced on the common IXO social media channels.\n\nThe expected benefits are:\n\n1. Get rewards for providing liquidity to Osmosis trading pools.\n2. Make IXO tokens available to the whole Cosmos ecosystem through IBC and Osmosis AMM.\n3. IXO will boost rewards with the native IXO tokens paid out for the first 2 weeks.

👍 97.4%, 👎 0.34%, 🕊️ 1.91%, ❌ 0.33% \n
This proposal would give a 0.5 ⚠️  ⚠️ % incentive share to pools 560 (Osmo/Ust) and 561 (Osmo/Luna) which would start paying out on the epoch of October 26. This would allow these pools to gain incentives sooner than they would following the standard process (October 29).\n\nThese incentive shares would be taken from the 1% of LP incentives currently paid to the community pool (so as not to disrupt the incentives of existing pools or the regular process). This share of funding is in addition to the 5% of overall issuance going to the community pool, so in effect it would change the community pool's share of Osmo issuance from 5.45 ⚠️ % to 5%.\n\nThis proposal would also act as governance agreement to these pools entering the onboarding process for regular incentive adjustments going forward.\n\nIf passed, these pools will be added to the regular adjustment proposal on October 25, but would start receiving incentives at this 0.5 ⚠️  ⚠️ % rate on October 26, and would then be adjusted to the appropriate level on October 29 following passage of the regular adjustment proposal.\n\nIf not passed, these pools will not be added to the spreadsheet / regular adjustment process, and will not start receiving incentives until approved (in another text proposal) and added to a regular adjustment proposal.

**Proposal details**
Signaling proposal for BCNA incentivized pools.
By voting YES to this proposal, OSMO stakers support adding OSMO incentives to BCNA-liquidity pools on Osmosis.

**Details**
This is a signaling proposal to include BCNA pairs into the set of assets that get OSMO liquidity incentives.

BCNA/OSMO (pool #571) and ATOM/BCNA (pool 572) trading pairs are live on Osmosis since Friday 29-10-2021. From the get-go these pools are incentivized by the BitCanna team (https://medium.com/@BitCannaGlobal/bitcanna-is-now-live-on-osmosis-dex-e67c2c83abbf ⚠️ ) to boost rewards for taking part in the liquidity pools.

After this proposal has passed governance, the BCNA pools are added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and begin the onboarding.

**About BitCanna**
BitCanna will provide a decentralized payment network for the legal cannabis industry, by means of the BitCanna Coin (BCNA).
BitCanna has already set up agreements with major companies in the European cannabis market, forming the BitCanna Alliance. The BitCanna Alliance works with legislators to solve the current paradox in the market. By implementing supply chain management and a trust & reputation layer, BitCanna aides legislators in creating a healthy and transparent cannabis market.

HackAtom VI is the biggest Hackatom in Cosmos history.  Osmosis, a core contributor to the Cosmos ecosystem, should participate as a sponsor to this event given that Osmosis originally started as the winning project of HackAtom V.

This is a proposal for the Osmosis Community Pool to allocate 50,000 USD to participate as a challenge sponsor to HackAtom VI.  A HackAtom sponsorship allows Osmosis governance to propose a hackathon challenge in one of the existing categories and use the full 50,000 USD sponsorship as prize pool money to pay the winners of the Osmosis challenge.  Examples of challenges from other projects can be found on the HackAtom website here:  https://hackatom.org ⚠️  

The Osmosis challenge should be open-ended, giving builders the flexibility to explore their ideas and build something outstanding.  For that reason, we propose that the Osmosis challenge to be:  

“Build something cool with Osmosis. Bonus points if you incorporate ION.”

A YES vote on this proposal signals an agreement to allocate 50,000 USD from the community pool as HackAtom VI challenge prize sponsorship by the Osmosis community.

Should this proposal pass, a follow-through community pool spend proposal will be submitted on December 17, 2021 (with the USD value to be decided based on the closing price of OSMO on December 16, 2021) to distribute the prizes to the winners of the Osmosis challenge. 

The prize distribution will be managed by Tendermint Inc, the organizers of HackAtom VI.

Signaling proposal for XKI incentivized pools
Voting Start: Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:57:15 UTC

👍 96.61%, 👎 0.89%, 🕊️ 2.47%, ❌ 0% \n
By voting YES to this proposal, OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:
 Adding OSMO incentives to XKI/OSMO and XKI/UST pools through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:
 Adding OSMO incentives to XKI-liquidity pools on Osmosis.

** Details **

The following proposal is a basic signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to include XKI pairs into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.

Regular XKI/OSMO and XKI/UST pools have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.

** Expected benefits **

The Liquidity Providers will then benefit from following incentives on OSMO/XKI & UST/XKI pools:
1. OSMO incentives for LP
2. SWAP Fees 

In order to incentivize more liquidity to be provided, the Ki Foundation will fund an additional incentive in XKI on the related pools.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s ⚠️  )

** About Ki & Klub **

Ki is offering the compliant gateway from the Fiat world to DeFi, through Klub Ki is building DeFi protocols that will live on top of Juno while being operated through interchain accounts of multiple chains.

By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:
Adding OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:
Adding OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

The following proposal is a basic signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to include XKI/JUNO pair into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.

Regular XKI/JUNO pool have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.

** Expected benefits **

Should this proposal pass, the Liquidity Providers will then benefit from following incentives on JUNO/XKI pool:

1. OSMO incentives for LP
2. SWAP Fees

In order to incentivize more liquidity to be provided, the Ki Foundation will fund an additional incentive in XKI on the related pools. An additional incentive is considered in JUNO through onchain governance.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s ⚠️  )

** About Ki & Klub **

Ki is offering the compliant gateway from the Fiat world to DeFi, through Klub Ki is building DeFi protocols that will live on top of Juno while being operated through interchain accounts of multiple chains.

Match External Incentives for SCRT/ATOM and SCRT/OSMO pairs

**Background**
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47, the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

**Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the Secret Network community for the SCRT/ATOM and SCRT/OSMO pairs. 

-   By voting **YES** on this proposal, external SCRT incentives will be matched at ~$10,000 per day
-   By voting **NO** on this proposal, external SCRT incentives will NOT be matched at ~$10,000 per day

**Context**
The proposal for the external incentives went live on the Secret Network on November 20th, 2021 and is passing with unanimous approval: https://wallet.keplr.app/#/secret/governance?detailId=64 ⚠️ . The discussion around the incentives can be seen here: https://forum.scrt.network/t/proposal-scrt-on-osmosis-early-pool-incentives-to-mitigate-slippage-and-boost-liquidity/4737 ⚠️ . This proposal is for ~$5000 per day in SCRT distributed across both pairs, however if the Osmosis community chooses to match, SCRT Labs will make the SCRT incentive ~$10,000 per day.

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$10,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54, these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.

- MED/ATOM (Pool #587)

After this proposal has passed governance, the Liquidity Providers on MED pools will benefit from the following incentives:
- OSMO incentives
- Swap fees

Also, the Panacea team is preparing an additional proposal for External MED Incentives in order to incentivize more liquidity to be provided.


** About Panacea & MediBloc **

Panacea is a Cosmos-based blockchain that has been launched in 2019 by MediBloc.
On top of Panacea, MediBloc is designing the generic data sharing/verification protocol, so that anyone can:
- issue various data in verifiable manners
- own their data securely
- present their data to someone to get benefits

Also, MediBloc is planning to extend that data protocol to the data market protocol, so that data owners can get incentivized transparently by providing their data securely to various data consumers.

For that vision, MediBloc has implemented core building blocks on Panacea, such as DID / VerifiableCredentials / SelectiveDisclosure using ZKP.
In near future, MediBloc is going to present the first version of the data sharing protocol publicly, so that it can be improved by various community members.

Furthermore, MediBloc has released Dr.palette ⚠️  EHR (Electronic Health Record) for hospitals and Medipass PHR (Electronic Health Record) for patients. Those applications would be the first players who boost the verifiable data sharing protocol. It means that MediBloc will show the first example that the protocol can be very useful in the healthcare field. It would be a great impact because healthcare data is not only one of the most inaccessible data types, but also requires many privacy concerns.

While MediBloc is developing those use-cases, we would like to maximize the liquidity of MED which will be used for the verifiable data protocol in near future.

- own their data securely
- present their data to someone to get benefits

Also, MediBloc is planning to extend that data protocol to the data market protocol, so that data owners can get incentivized transparently by providing their data securely to various data consumers.

For that vision, MediBloc has implemented core building blocks on Panacea, such as DID / VerifiableCredentials / SelectiveDisclosure using ZKP.
In near future, MediBloc is going to present the first version of the data sharing protocol publicly, so that it can be improved by various community members.

Furthermore, MediBloc has released Dr.palette EHR (Electronic Health Record) for hospitals and Medipass PHR (Electronic Health Record) for patients. Those applications would be the first players who boost the verifiable data sharing protocol. It means that MediBloc will show the first example that the protocol can be very useful in the healthcare field. It would be a great impact because healthcare data is not only one of the most inaccessible data types, but also requires many privacy concerns.

While MediBloc is developing those use-cases, we would like to maximize the liquidity of MED which will be used for the verifiable data protocol in near future.

- BTSG/OSMO (Pool #573)
- BTSG/ATOM (Pool #574)
- BTSG/UST (Pool #592)

By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to these BTSG liquidity pools on Osmosis.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to these BTSG liquidity pools on Osmosis.

After this proposal has passed governance, the Liquidity Providers on BTSG pools will benefit from the following incentives:

- OSMO incentives
- Swap fees

BitSong has already launched External BTSG Incentives for the pools to further incentivize liquidity provision.

- IPFS Proposal: ipfs://QmXojjjeguZ1P6Fr3zNxZSbxmpQQ5ZJ5XM3493ZZ2EtacT ⚠️ 

**About BitSong**

BitSong is a multifunctional blockchain-based ecosystem built to empower the music industry. It unites artists, fans, distributors in an environment where music, merchandise, and fan loyalty are assets of value. BitSong’s decentralized ecosystem of services provides the global music community with a trustless marketplace for music streaming, Fan Tokens, and NFTs, powered by the BTSG token.

After launching the main BitSong blockchain in August 2020, the bitsong-2b mainnet went live on October 21, 2021. Securing deep liquidity for BTSG is now a critical component of our strategy to attract artists, fans, traders, and investors to the BitSong ecosystem.

Match External Incentives for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pairs
Voting Start: Wed, 01 Dec 2021 06:25:53 UTC
Voting End: Sat, 04 Dec 2021 06:25:53 UTC
👍 94.42%, 👎 2.06%, 🕊️ 3.4%, ❌ 0.1% \n
** Background **

As established in Osmosis Proposal #47: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47 ⚠️ , the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

MED liquidity pools have been listed on Osmosis since 23 Nov 2021.
A signaling proposal for promoting MED pools to Incentivized Pools has been passed: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/78 ⚠️ . According to the signaling proposal, the UpdatePoolIncentives proposal is in its voting period: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/79 ⚠️ .


** Proposal Details **

This is a proposal to allocate ~$900,000-worth MEDs for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pools on Osmosis to be provided by MediBloc.
Also, this proposes for the Osmosis community to launch the Incentive Matching program for MED pools.
This helps increase liquidity and most importantly ensures that the price slippage can be reduced.

By voting YES on this proposal, external MED incentives will be matched at ~$5,000-worth MEDs per pool per day for 90 days.
By voting NO on this proposal, external MED incentives will NOT be matched at ~$5,000-worth MEDs per pool per day for 90 days.

The MediBloc has prepared 12,222,725 MED which is approximately equivalent to $900,000 based on the average market closing price for the last 7 days as of 26 Nov 2021 (according to the historical data of CoinMarketCap).

The MED incentives for each MED pool will be the following:
- MED/OSMO (Pool #586): ~67,904 MED per day for 90 days (~$5,000 approximately)
- MED/ATOM (Pool #587): ~67,904 MED per day for 90 days (~$5,000 approximately)

All MED used for these liquidity incentives will be matched with an equal value of OSMO incentives if this proposal is passed by the Osmosis community.

These will be split up into the following buckets for each bonding period:
- 1-day bonding: 8,488 MED/day
- 7-day bonding: 25,464 MED/day
- 14-day bonding: 33,952 MED/day

Background
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47 ⚠️ ) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

** Proposal Details** 
Match external incentives provided by the Comdex team for CMDX/ATOM (pool 600) and CMDX/OSMO (pool 601). External incentives have already begun and will continue for 90 epochs.
- By voting YES on this proposal, external CMDX incentives will be matched at ~$72,000 per day
- By voting NO on this proposal, external CMDX incentives will NOT be matched at ~$72,000 per day

** Context **
The Comdex team has provided 3,000,000 CMDX across CMDX/ATOM pool 600 and CMDX/OSMO pool 601 amounting to ~$6,500,000 over the course of 90 epochs beginning Wednesday, December 8th and 12:00 UTC.

The CMDX incentives are as follows:
- CMDX/ATOM (Pool #600): ~16667 CMDX per day amounting to ~$36,000
- CMDX/OSMO (Pool #601): ~16667 CMDX per day amounting to ~$36,000

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$72,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/54 ⚠️ , these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.

The hypothesis is that this variable should be turned up to probably 25% but in multiple phases to allow for observation of the impacts.\n\n\n*****Proposal*****\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal you signal approval to increase the Adjust Scale variable +5% (15% to 20%)\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal you signal dissent and want the Adjust Scale variable to remain at 15%\n\n\n*****Commonwealth Discussion*****\nhttps://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/2802-increasing-weekly-adjustment-rate\n\n\n*****Adjust Scaling CAP Model*****\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G-UGlzyJHuHFqdmGPxiE6hHVscBDtxOFZVMFPo5lTsc\n\nShowing pools that have too high incentives that are reducing too slowly (Blue), too low incentives that are increasing too slowly (Green) and that the scaling does not apply to due to low maturity (Grey)",0,title_and_description

# Osmosis v5 Boron Upgrade\n\n  Rendered https://hackmd.io/tJHNqU_kRW6ZTdGNQNHlIQ?view ⚠️  \n\nThis proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the  v5.0.0 https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `2383300`. The timing of this upgrade is crucial to properly execute the  Proposal 32 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32 ⚠️  ⚠️  airdrop clawback. This clawback should happen right at the Airdrop end date of December 15th 5PM UTC, thus this upgrade must execute before it. \n\nThe upgrade block height `2383300` is estimated to be at December 14th, UTC 2:30PM. Block times have high variance, so please be monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \n\n## Upgrade features\n\nThis upgrade adds features such as:\n\n- Upgrade Cosmos-SDK to  SDK v0.44 https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3 ⚠️  from SDK v0.42 For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see its  changelog https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21 ⚠️ . Noteable highlights include:\n    -  Authz https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec ⚠️  - Allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). \n- New modules:\n    -  Bech32IBC https://github.com/osmosis-labs/bech32-ibc ⚠️  - Allows auto-routing of send msgs to addresses on other chains, once configured by governance. Allows you to do a bank send on Osmosis to a cosmos1... address, and it is automatically sent to the corresponding Cosmos Hub address over IBC. This is a big step in enabling more seemless IBC UX.\n    -  TxFees https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees ⚠️  - Enables validators to easily accept txfees in multiple assets, whitelisted by governance, by declaring minimum fees in OSMO.  Alternative fee assets are converted to their OSMO value, using the spot price on their primary OSMO base pair pool.  This upgrade pre-whitelists all the assets currently supported on the Osmosis frontend with an OSMO basepair pool.\n- Implements  Proposal 32 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32 ⚠️  ⚠️  - Clawback of unclaimed Osmo and Ion on airdrop end date. (December 15th, 5PM UTC)\n- Upgrade IBC from a standalone module in the SDK to  IBC v2 https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0 ⚠️ . This improves the utility of Ethereum Bridges and Cosmwasm bridges.\n- Blocking  OFAC banned ETH addresses https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sanctions/1.0/sdn_advanced.xml ⚠️  \n- Numerous minor bug fixes, gas fixes, and significant speedups.\n\nSee more in the  changelog https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md\n\n## ⚠️  Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\nAll nodes will require 32GB of memory. Swap can be used to achieve this, but getting nodes with 32GB RAM is _significantly_ preferred. Furthermore, NVMe SSDs significantly improve the speed of execution.\n\nPlease follow the setup instructions here for how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade:  Upgrade Guide https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.x/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v5/guide.md.\n\nNamely ⚠️ , configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you have to install cosmovisor from the SDK v0.42.9 branch) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd`  `v5.0.0` https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin/`.\n\nIf you do not want to use cosmovisor due to cosmovisor reliability issues, please be prepared to upgrade at around 2:30PM UTC, December 14th if this proposal passes.\n\n## Details of upgrade time\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the Osmosis blockchain will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v5.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `2383300`, anticipated to be at `Wednesday December 14th 2:30PM UTC (9:30AM EST)`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.65 ⚠️  seconds per block, derived from Cros-nest dashboard. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 100 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\n

By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:
Removing OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:
Removing OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

The following proposal is a special signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to remove XKI/JUNO pair into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.
Regular XKI/JUNO pool have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.
A proposal for JUNO incentives that would be matched by XKI incentives has been posted and rejected by the Juno community as it happened to be more controversial than expected: https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/7 ⚠️ .

In order to remain fair to the OSMOSIS community, the Ki Foundation offers to support the removal of OSMO incentives from the JUNO / XKI pools as it has been stated on the live with Cryptocito: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=leY7R217qss ⚠️ .

This proposal has for sole goal to keep a spirit of fairness towards the Osmosis community, as we will continue building products on the Juno chain and continue our support on making the Cosmos ecosystem a more interoperable space!

Stargaze Community Loan and LBP
Voting Start: Tue, 14 Dec 2021 05:21:39 UTC
Voting End: Fri, 17 Dec 2021 05:21:39 UTC
👍 97.01%, 👎 0.28%, 🕊️ 2.61%, ❌ 0.08% \n
This proposal includes the details regarding the loan of OSMO to Stargaze’s multi-sig and the parameters of the LBP. By voting Yes on this proposal will signify approval for both a loan of OSMO to Stargaze, and Stargaze will then launch and LBP with the following parameters with that funding. 
The request for a loan of 135,000 OSMO (~$724K) from the Osmosis community treasury to a multi-sig controlled by community members. Stargaze will use this OSMO to launch a 95/5 Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) on Osmosis. 

The members of this multi-sig will include: 
- James Parillo, Figment
- Shane Vitarana, Stargaze
- Cosmostation

Based on the LBP mechanics and OSMO volumes, the starting price of STARS will be $0.28 ⚠️  ⚠️ .
Stargaze will pay back the value of the original loan in STARS once the LBP has ended.
There will be a 0.3 ⚠️ % swap fee - Osmosis and Stargaze community pools will split the rewards of this fee 50/50.

Stargaze multi-sig public address: stars1s3unu92e8zv8mfw7n5d4vrgkj9chn7yvnhn27d


Background:
LBPs are a way to ensure a fair distribution of tokens at launch and to discover a fair market price of the token with low capital requirements. A 95/5 pool will have 95% of STARS to 5% of OSMO value. Over a period of 3 days, the goal is for the pool to reach 50/50 value.
LBPs allow teams to build liquidity without a large amount of upfront capital. It also separates the mechanisms for distributing tokens from the token price. This will be the first community pool loan for Osmosis and Stargaze.
Liquidity pools work within the crypto space with automated market makers, providing token holders and networks with liquidity through decentralized mechanisms. Liquidity pools usually only have a 50/50 ratio, where the value of Asset A equals the value of Asset B.

Potential Risks:
If there are no purchases for STARS, the price would fall to zero as the weighting decreases and the fluctuation in weighting creates constant downward pressure on the price.

This is a signalling proposal for the transfer of 1.399mm $REGEN to the Osmosis community.

This transfer will be to the community pool address, giving osmo holders ownership and ability to utilize these tokens through the existing osmosis governance process.

We expect this allocation to be used strategically for protocol-owned liquidity provision, use-cases exploring eco-credits, modest provision of yield farming provisions, matching grants to public goods, and open-source development funding.

We propose the main criteria for judging use-cases should be the long term strategic benefit to leveraging the Osmosis DEX in partnership with Regen Network as an originator for ecological assets that create a new Regenerative Finance asset class native to our growing IBC ecosystem.

Voting YES on this proposal signals the Osmosis community’s willingness to receive this grant, and govern it for LONG TERM strategic benefit as outlined broadly above.

# [Action Required] IBC patch upgrade at 2464000\\n\\nThe v5 upgrade had a subtle bug that prevents creation of new IBC channels.\\n\\nNo current user funds are at risk, and the bug does not affect trading, LP, bonding.\\n\\nAll existing IBC channels function just as before, IBC deposits and withdrawals for existing assets are not affected.\\n\\nThe bug solely prevents new channels from being created, preventing new chains from connecting to Osmosis. Bug details at the end.\\n\\nThis proposal suggests doing an emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v6 binary. This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The  v6.0.0 ⚠️  software version https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v6.0.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  is fully state-compatible with `v5.0.0` until the upgrade block `2464000`, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v3 upgrade (prop 17), used when the governance deposit mechanism was broken.\\n\\nThe proposed upgrade block height of 2464000 is estimated to be at December 20, 2021, 16:00 UTC (Monday).\\n\\nAll validators, and full node operators should update their software to version `v6.0.0 ⚠️ ` prior to block height 2464000. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\\n\\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\\n\\n## Actionable(s)\\n\\n* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0 ⚠️ ` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0 ⚠️ `, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0 ⚠️ .\\n* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\\n* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\\n\\n## Failure case and risks involved\\n\\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - ""validators"" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis ⚠️ )\\n\\nNote: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\\n\\n## Governance procedure\\n\\n A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\\n A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\\n\\nDeposits are intended to be used by validators here.\\n\\n- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key. Please do this, even if your validator operator key is behind a multisig. This is a good time to take advantage of authz, to allow easier depositing & voting.\\n- Once over 66% of voting power has signalled readiness, this upgrade proposal is considered valid.\\n- Should this proposal fail to gather readiness signalling from two-thirds of voting power by December 20th 4AM UTC, the upgrade proposal should be considered failed and validators should revert to the old binary prior to block 2464000.\\n\\n## Testing methodology\\n\\nThis upgrade has been tested to be compatible with v5.0.0 until the upgrade height on a testnet. This was done by having a v6.0.0 ⚠️  validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected). The v6.0.0 ⚠️  node could then receive IBC transfers.\\n\\n## Bug Details\\n\\nRelevant issue:  osmosis-labs/osmosis #665 https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/665\\n\\nTL;DR ⚠️  - There was a subtle misconfiguration in the Osmosis app.go ⚠️ .

**Background**
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47 ⚠️ ) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

**Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the BitSong team for BTSG/OSMO (pool 573), BTSG/ATOM (pool 574) and BTSG/UST (pool 592). External incentives have already begun and will continue for 30 epochs.

By voting YES on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will be matched at ~$22,000 per day, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
By voting NO on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will NOT be matched at ~$22,000 per day, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG

**Context**
The BitSong team has provided the second batch of 1,500,000 BTSG across BTSG/OSMO pool 573, BTSG/ATOM pool 574 and BTSG/UST pool 592, amounting to ~$660,000, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG, over the course of 30 epochs beginning Wednesday, December 29th at 00:00am UTC.

The $BTSG incentives are as follows:

BTSG/OSMO (Pool #573): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ ,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
BTSG/ATOM (Pool #574): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ ,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
BTSG/UST (Pool #592): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ ,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$22,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/54 ⚠️ , these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.

Follow-up on proposal #111 which was rejected on purpose, read the details below for more information.

**Proposal goal:**

This proposal will enable the unfreezing process of the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network, thus allowing deposits and withdrawals of **$LUM** on the Osmosis platform:

- By voting **YES**, OSMO stakers voice their support in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network
- By voting **NO**, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network

This proposal has no effect beside enabling back the IBC connection between the two chains.

**Details:**

The IBC connection between Osmosis and the Lum Network was shutdown during the **$LUM** Liquidity Bootstrapping Phase in order to have a proper price discovery without external interferences.

Shutting down the IBC connection froze the currently use channel (3-115). Meaning that no IBC transfer can be made using this channel unless this governance proposal is voted **YES** by OSMO stakers.

The process to enable IBC transfers back require to substitute the current IBC client by a new one that is not in an expired state.

This proposal is a follow-up on the proposal #111 which was rejected on purpose since it raised technical concerns.
Indeed, this process had not been tested properly in production prior to proposal #111 and Lum team along Osmosis team agreed to provide a better testing background prior to asking everyone to vote YES to this proposal.

Tests have now been performed succesfully and we are confident this proposal will not have undesired side effects!
The following repository contains a full test suite representing what will happen once this proposal is voted YES: https://github.com/lum-network/ibc-testbed ⚠️ 

The Lum Team also wrote a mega-thread on Twitter detailing everything that happened since its main-net launch in order to give more colour to the discussion and debate around this IBC issue: https://twitter.com/lum_network/status/1475261081333477378 ⚠️

Incentives for this pool we're already approved in prop 71, but the pool was created later than the CMDX/OSMO and CMDX/ATOM pools (so I missed it).

**Proposal descriptions:**

- By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to ATOM/DSM (#618) and DSM/OSMO (#619) pools on Osmosis.
- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to ATOM/DSM (#618) and DSM/OSMO (#619) pools on Osmosis.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to include DSM pairs,  ATOM/DSM (#618) https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/618 ⚠️  and  DSM/OSMO (#619) https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/619 ⚠️ , into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. Both of these pools have been live since 13 January 2022 (UTC).

A total of 5,000,000 DSM external incentive, which are worth of .9million as of this writing, have become effective on 15 Jan 2022.

After this proposal has passed, the above DSM pools will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

**About DSM**

Desmos Token, or DSM, is the native token on the Desmos blockchain. Built with Cosmos SDK, Desmos serves as the backbone to empower the development of user-centric decentralized social networks in the metaverse.

To make Desmos more community-driven, we have launched a 21m DSM airdrop program (21% of the genesis supply) to over 280,000 wallet addresses across 11 Cosmos ecosystem chains.

- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to ATOM/DSM (#618) and DSM/OSMO (#619) pools on Osmosis.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to include DSM pairs, [ATOM/DSM (#618)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/618) and [DSM/OSMO (#619)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/619), into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. Both of these pools have been live since 13 January 2022 (UTC).

A total of 5,000,000 DSM external incentive, which are worth of .9million as of this writing, have become effective on 15 Jan 2022.

After this proposal has passed, the above DSM pools will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

**About DSM**

Desmos Token, or DSM, is the native token on the Desmos blockchain. Built with Cosmos SDK, Desmos serves as the backbone to empower the development of user-centric decentralized social networks in the metaverse.

To make Desmos more community-driven, we have launched a 21m DSM airdrop program (21% of the genesis supply) to over 280,000 wallet addresses across 11 Cosmos ecosystem chains.

Add a bias factor to external incentive matching

If another project allocates incentives to a non-osmo pool, Osmosis right now matches its incentives equally to how it matches non-osmo pools. This comes at a cost to all of the 'main' swap-fee driven pool incentives. (As this is osmo rewards they are not getting!)\n\nThis proposal proposes that external incentive matching maintain the same bias factor that is used for all incentivized pools within Osmosis. If the bias factor system (or equivalent preferential treatment for certain base asset) changes as time goes on, the external incentive matching should adapt in the same fashion.\n\nRight now proposal 127 feels ill-advised without this type of mechanism in place, as it is increasing the % of osmo incentives being allocated for incentive matching, without improving upon any of the core problems currently present in the external matching system. Right now, it is bad that there is no accounting for bias factors, thus over-paying for non-osmo base pair pools, and it is bad that a few high external incentive pools take the entire matching pot. There should instead be per-asset / per-pool caps, as there is 0 obligation for 1-1 matching as the ratio. It is also significant that prop 127 a significant 50% increase, without much discussion, put up in haste. And without the community being very clear that its going to lower APYs to every other pool, e.g. osmo/atom, osmo/ust, osmo/luna, with the difference being giving atom/huahua 300% instead of 210% osmo APY. In defense of proposal 127, this was done, due to the 20% cap for external incentive matching being made without a clear guideline for how it'll be enforced being agreed upon. (As it was not specified in prop 47)\n\nAs a response, this proposal is also put up in haste, to try to fix some of the core problems in a way that the commonwealth, Osmosis discord, and Osmosis siberia comunities have already expressed agreement in. Namely, make external incentive matching follow the same bias factor present in Osmosis. This concretely means that the Osmo-side bonus APY for external incentive ATOM pools will halve. However, the swap fee APY, swap-fee induced osmo APY, plus the actual external incentive APY will remain as before. This a better allocation for incentives that governance has already agreed upon, and it was inconsistent that this was not already being done for external incentive matching.

Voting YES for this proposal indicates that matching external incentives will no more than double the standard OSMO incentives for a pool and not be matched more than 1:1 in dollar value.\n\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that external incentives will continue to be over-matched according to the external incentive dollar value provided according the bias established in proposal 128 and only capped by the 30% global cap established in proposal 127. \n\n This proposal asks two questions of Osmosis governance and was combined as they are linked.\n The external incentive program established in Proposal 47 has resulted in huge amounts of external tokens being distributed to Osmosis Liquidity Providers as rewards. However, the recent external incentives for STARS, HUAHUA and CMDX, as well as the proposed external ROWAN incentives in #132, have been substantially higher than previous ones. Matching these has resulted in a large amount of the daily Osmosis incentive distribution being used for matching purposes and has had proportionately reduced the APR across other pools without matching incentives.\n A bias to external incentives has been confirmed in Proposal 128. This is not a simple weighting to provide non-Osmosis incentives 50% of the rewards that Osmosis pools do. Instead the weight of non-OSMO pools is decreased by 50% as well as the weight of OSMO pools being raised by 50%.\n As a result of this, on the next semi-automatic incentives proposal, each  of external incentives on non-OSMO pools will not only be matched by bash.50 in OSMO rewards, but would also result in OSMO pools being matched by .50. (In both instances up to the 30% overall cap coming into effect). \n\n This proposal requests that the maximum match for  in external incentives is  in OSMO. \n\n These external incentives have also generated a lot of hype around high APRs, partially funded by Osmosis matching these high external incentives on new pools. This may have caused price increases of these tokens as liquidity providers seek to buy in to pools with higher APRs.

Incentivising UST and Luna on Osmosis exposes the ecosystem and stakeholders to significant regulatory and stability risk.

In many ways UST is similar to Stripper Dollars:

1. UST adoption has to a large extent been driven by shady activities and circumvention of regulation. This includes enticing the wider public to trade regulated products without any consumer protection (Mirror Protocol) and luring savers with high returns without explaining the risk of losing the principal (Anchor Protocol) when/if UST collapses.
2. Like Stripper Dollars, UST provides no clear benefits compared to ""the real deal"", i.e. a USD backed stablecoin. Only Luna holders benefit from the minting of UST.
3. Stripper Dollars have a tendency to become worthless overnight. Algorithmic stablecoins have a similar track record.

Is UST really the best USD stablecoin for Osmosis? It seems like we could easily do better by adopting an existing USD backed stablecoin such as USDC.

When evaluating the commentary and voting on this proposal, keep in mind that key figures from in the Cosmos ecosystem are heavily invested in Luna and thus have strong economic incentive to see UST and Luna integrated in Osmosis, regardless of risk and long term consequences to the ecosystem.

Voting *YES* on this proposal signal that we, as the broader community,

1. Desire a more robust, better regulated and more transparent USD stablecoin for Osmosis, that is future proof. This could be USDC bridged from Ethereum or a similar mechanism.
2. Reject offering OSMO incentives for Luna and UST pools as it exposes the Osmosis community to regulatory risk from (at least) the SEC. If this proposal passes, it minimises the gauge settings from proposal #52 ""Add Incentives to Osmo/Ust and Osmo/Luna"".


Background:

Regulatory Risk:
Mr. Do Kwon is currently engaging in fisticuffs with SEC lawyers regarding the specifics of how (and if) he was served during Mainnet 2021. This seems like a feeble attempt to distract from what is really the larger play regarding UST and Luna.
https://www.scribd.com/document/534537134/Terraform-v-SEC ⚠️ 

Even if the SEC is unsuccessful in shutting down Terraform Labs and it's services in South Korea, they can certainly persue U.S. entities offering trading and staking services around UST and Luna.

Offering incentives in the form of OSMO incentives for Luna and UST on Osmosis exposes the wider community (including validators) to this same level of scrutiny. If this is a concern for you, vote *YES* on this proposal.


Stability Risk:
Algorithmic stablecoins have historically imploded spectacularly once their supply decreases and they enter a death spiral.

This is also a likely outcome for Terra stablecoins and it might be an understatement to claim Terraform Labs are scrambling to sustain growth: An additional 3-4 billion UST is about to be minted.

- By voting YES, OSMO stakers voice their support in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network
- By voting NO, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network

This proposal has no effect beside enabling back the IBC connection between the two chains.

**Details:**

The IBC connection between Osmosis and the Lum Network was shutdown during the $LUM Liquidity Bootstrapping Phase in order to have a proper price discovery without external interferences.

Shutting down the IBC connection froze the currently use channel (3-115). Meaning that no IBC transfer can be made using this channel unless this governance proposal is voted YES by OSMO stakers.

Development and Marketing Expansion to the Russian Community
Voting Start: Fri, 28 Jan 2022 10:20:27 UTC
Voting End: Mon, 31 Jan 2022 10:20:27 UTC
👍 8.67%, 👎 63.15%, 🕊️ 25.15%, ❌ 3.01% \n
By voting YES on this proposal, the community agrees to allocate 7500 OSMO for developmental and marketing expansion to the Russian-speaking crypto space.
 By voting NO on this proposal, the community dissents on allocating 7500 OSMOS for developmental and marketing expansion to the Russian-speaking crypto space.

 The IBC Gang and Osmosis are almost completely unknown in the Russian-speaking crypto community. We propose to facilitate an expansion of Osmosis into the Russian-speaking crypto space, through marketing access to forklog.com ⚠️ , facilitating Russian-language content and providing developer support.
Summary of the proposal: ForkLog is the biggest Russian-language crypto magazine, working since 2014. Our website reports on everything in crypto and attracts about 1M readers monthly with over 6M monthly page views. With the funding we will do a series of articles and videos on Osmosis on Forklog.com ⚠️ . A more detailed overview of the exact services can be found in the attached full proposal.
The second part of the proposal is aimed at increasing the outreach to Russian-language developers. It includes a complete translation of the technical documentation of Osmosis (Gitbook, Docbook) into Russian and the establishment of Russian-language developer support on Discord from our developer James.

 - By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to adding OSMO incentives to https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/617 ⚠️  ⚠️ . 

 This is a signalling proposal to include the ATOM:CHEQ pair into the set of assets which receive OSMO liquidity incentives, which has been requested by the CHEQ community who are eager to provide liquidity.
 The benefit to the Osmosis community from cheqd.io ⚠️  is pretty clear: The team are experts in digital identity, specifically self-sovereign identity (SSI) where the individual holds their own data, following the ""Hold your own keys"" mantra. In a short span of time, they have established partnerships with some of the largest SSI software vendors in the world. They want to bring identity to the IBC stack in a way that preserves user privacy and bring Cosmos to the SSI community. Currently, there are CHEQ external incentives on CHEQ:OSMO (pool #602) which are matched with OSMO incentives; as well as CHEQ external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ (pool #617).

Allocate 125k Osmo from the OCP to give Support/Marketing access to guidance on business matters related to Defi, DAOs, and structuring.
Voting Start: Wed, 02 Mar 2022 15:46:17 UTC
Voting End: Sat, 05 Mar 2022 15:46:17 UTC
👍 34.78%, 👎 56.43%, 🕊️ 6.34%, ❌ 2.43% \n
This proposal is to allocate 125k OSMO to a multi-sig wallet controlled by members of the Osmosis Support Lab and Osmosis Ministry of Marketing.  The wallet will then delegate all funding to Redline validation in exchange for consulting services related to Defi, DAOs,and structuring.  This delegation will hold for a minimum of 6 months.  At the end of 6 months the two working groups will assess if we need to increase, decrease or undelegate funding.  Any funds not used for delegations to Redline will be sent directly back to the community pool.  When services are no longer needed or wanted, this funding will return directly back to the community pool.  This is a no loss scenario for the community pool, as the requested funds will never be spent or leave the multi-sig wallet except to be returned to the community pool. 

 The members of the OSL and OMM have vetted Redline and its services and their current engagements with many reputable teams and projects. At a high level Redline will be providing key services and recommendations to reduce major bottlenecks related to structuring recommendations, support, and logistical help. In fact they have already completed bodies of work. Given our previous unsuccessful efforts to solicit these services from various other vendors, Redline has already delivered better than expected results in a timely manner 

 This approach will be the first example of community funded consultation for community funded initiatives.  The delegation will ensure the two groups can confidently engage with adequate consulting teams necessary for them to have maximum impact with the funding allocated to them.  This service can be used by other working groups in Osmosis and is not exclusive to Support and Marketing.  We advise all teams and users to engage with Redline before committing any delegations as they will be a 100% validator 

 About Redline: 
 “Redline specializes in consulting services and helps crypto teams, foundations, and DAOs navigate through the unique hurdles presented to crypto and DeFi.  Our unique model provides access to top-tier talent without any out-of-pocket costs or traditional bottlenecks.   We are quick to execute an engagement, are fully transparent, and are tailored for the dynamic crypto environment.”

The Hope community Dao has approved a governance proposal on DaoDao to allocate 1000 HOPE (6,18% of the total supply) to be used as external liquidity rewards on the HOPE/OSMO pool #653. 

These are the characteristics of the gauge we will create:
-pool #653 HOPE/OSMO
-1 external incentive
-1000 HOPE 
-14 days bonding
-duration 180 epochs

Reasoning as to why it's just a 1 gauge: HOPE is a long-term project, and is really only interested in attracting long-term liquidity providers.


About Hope Galaxy project:

The HOPE Token, in addition could be burnt in order to claim an exclusive Hope Galaxy NFT. 

The Hope Galaxy NFT collection will consist of 4 collections “Galaxies”, 2000 NFTs each with its own unique traits and stories, and 1 “starship” Collection of 180 NFTs.

HOPE Token has a fixed supply, the scarcity of the token will increase with the minting of each subsequent Galaxy, as individuals are required to destroy (“burn”) a token in order to receive a Hope Galaxy NFT.

All Hope Galaxy NFTs are made for metaverse and gaming applications, with the aim of producing benefits for the owners.

 This proposal asks for a reduction of the Voting Period from 5 days to 2 days due to Osmosis needing to respond rapidly to the ongoing Terra depeg event, Osmosis incentive restructuring and a rapidly changing environment.
This reduction to the Voting Period will be temporary. A follow-up governance proposal will be posted no later then 1st July 2022 to revert the Voting Period back to 5 days, implement a variable voting period for proposal types or request an extension to this emergency Voting Period.
 During this period governance should be vigilant to any proposals as the time for discussion is very limited. Proposals loaded on a Friday or Saturday should be given additional scrutiny before voting to ensure that they are not taking advantage of historical lowered governance turnout over weekends.

This proposal will remove all OSMO incentives for the NON-OSMO pairs of the following assets:\n\n* MED\n* BCNA\n* HUAHUA\n* UMEE\n* DSM\n* LIKE\n\nIn addition, OSMO incentives for ALL pairs will be removed from the following assets:\n\n* XKI\n* BOOT\n* LUM\n* DEC\n* IXO\n* CHEQ\n* DARC\n* MNTL\n* SWTH\n* DIG\n* VDL\n* MARBLE\n* NETA\n* CRBRUS\n\nOn June 20, 2022, the total OSMO emissions were reduced by 33%. This had the immediate effect of lowering staking and LP reward returns. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: first is to remove incentives from the aforementioned pools, freeing up incentives to add to assets that will bring value to OSMO stakers, holders, and LPers. Second, to ignite discussion about the process of awarding incentives in the first place. Notably, these incentives were instituted with minimal to no vetting, by simple goverance vote.\n\nIf party wishes to state the case that any given asset or pool should have OSMO incentives, let them demonstrate the merits of their proposition.

## Summary
The **ION DAO** has successfully gone through testnet and is now ready to launch onto the Osmosis mainnet.

Vote **YES** on this proposal if you want the bytecodes of ION Staking contract (as part of ION DAO) to be put onto Osmosis.  
Vote **NO** on this proposal if you do not want the bytecodes of ION Staking contract (as part of ION DAO) to go on chain.

Checksum of the contracts are following.

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5 ⚠️ %) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

Website:  https://ion.wtf ⚠️   
Commonwealth Thread:  https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4956-proposal-put-ion-dao-contracts-on-chain-on-osmosis ⚠️ 

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js ⚠️  (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ⚠️  ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ⚠️  ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%

Commonwealth Thread:  https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4956-proposal-put-ion-dao-contracts-on-chain-on-osmosis ⚠️ 

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js ⚠️  (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ⚠️  ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ⚠️  ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%

Remove blocked.go from Osmosis

👍 4.9%, 👎 28.85%, 🕊️ 64.14%, ❌ 2.1% \n
# Proposal\n\n This proposal aims to come to consensus that we should delete the blocked.go ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  file in the Osmosis Github Repository (https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/app/blocked.go ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ ). My name is Anthony Rosa, and I am the project lead at Moultrie Audits. Centralized entities like Tether are holding firm to protect censorship resistance (https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1562468486886346753?s=20&t=R3Gc5J6rUnSfOzeYxNZyuw ⚠️ ). There are many aspects to this conversation, and it is encouraged to read through the associated commonwealth threads (linked below) prior to voting. The blocked.go ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  file prevents users from withdrawing to the contained blocked addresses, and the file comments state “we block all OFAC-blocked ETH addresses from receiving tokens.” If we accept as a community that we should censor addresses the government deems illegitimate, our entire purpose becomes questionable.\n\n # Reasons To Delete blocked.go ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ \n\nWhy have a blockchain if the service retains the censorship restrictions of Web2? How can we claim to be decentralized while preventing users from accessing a service through a central repository subject to revision by the government? Why wouldn’t this set a censorship precedent? Are we here to make money or change the world? \n\nIt is my opinion that it’s better if we fail trying to democratize finance with a truly decentralized DEX than succeed as a TradFi proxy, touting disingenuous values. In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated, “If we do nothing about it now, you will see a slow but steady erosion of your right to trade freely...We need to come together and support our freedom to trade crypto in the spirit with which most of it has been developed – permissionlessly.”\n\n# Counterarguments\n\nThere are severe possible consequences for not complying with OFAC or any other government requirement to block specific addresses. Removing the functionality to block addresses at a protocol level opens up financial and legal risk to infrastructure providers, developers, users, investors, and the entire Osmosis community. Validator level censorship is still a possibility, but an additional burden.\n\n In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated “I don't think this is morally the right direction, by the US government, or by implementing these policies. However, I do think logically it is the best step forward to preserve and protect our validators.” \n\n# Vote Explanation\n\nYes: Developers should move to remove the blocked.go ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  file from the Osmosis repo. We’ll start by deleting the addresses in the file.\n No: We should keep the blocked.go ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  file and associated functionality.\nNo With Veto: You believe this proposal is spam or malicious to Osmosis and we should keep the blocked.go ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  file and associated functionality. Moultrie Audits will lose the deposit.\n\n# Links\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/6591-blockedgo-ofac ⚠️  | https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/6734-remove-blockedgo-from-osmosis\n ⚠️  Longer Justification To Deleting blocked.go ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ : https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeJ2g7ths2HpqqhnHYmGPr4RcJemWHSEQ6p8jpBQDq8gY/Osmosis%20Prop.pdf ⚠️

"Remove blocked.go from Osmosis

# Proposal\n\n This proposal aims to come to consensus that we should delete the blocked.go file in the Osmosis Github Repository (https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/app/blocked.go).

Upgrade Terra Classic To Re-enable IBC
Voting Start: Fri, 03 Jun 2022 20:43:46 UTC

This signaling proposal will set the course of a software upgrade that is needed on Terra Classic (Columbus-5), hereinafter called “legacy Terra”, to re-enable IBC functionality to Osmosis and Juno.

The IBC channels 1, 20, and 49 (corresponding to Osmosis, Juno, and Crescent, respectively) were set to be “CLOSED” state as part of the v0.5.20 upgrade of Terra core software (https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core/compare/v0.5.19...v0.5.20#diff-0f1d2976054440336a576d47a44a37b80cdf6701dd9113012bce0e3c425819b7L585-R615 ⚠️ ). In order for these channels to be re-enabled, their states need to be set to “OPEN” via a similar software upgrade.

- By voting YES on this proposal, delegators and validators signal that they are in favor of upgrading the legacy Terra chain to re-enable the previously closed IBC channels `channel-1` (osmosis), `channel-20` (juno) and `channel-49` (crescent)
- By voting NO on this proposal, delegators and validators signal their dissent about upgrading the legacy Terra chain for above stated reasons, or are against the way this proposal has been put up.

Why we use TerraV2 governance: the current state TerraV1 governance is in is debatable. This is a way of consulting the “new” Terra community, which was formed from two snapshots, and represents the stakeholders of the legacy Terra chain in an agreeable way.

If this proposal passes, the next step will be to prepare the software upgrade and propose it on legacy Terra, where legacy delegators and validators can have a final agreement.

Hermes Protocol will become the notifications and communications platform of web3. It brings massive utility to users for free while enabling new business opportunities for web3-native projects.
This team has unfortunately been left out of the previous proposal by a simple mistake and it shouldn't have happened, considering it fits the criteria of the previous disbursement.
A ""YES"" vote will signal funding support for this team and project, and the amount requested (and the respective vesting terms) are defined on the Agora post.

Terra Stablecoin Infrastructure Proposal by Stably

Voting End: Tue, 20 Sep 2022 04:01:58 UTC
👍 26.56%, 👎 48.69%, 🕊️ 24.7%, ❌ 0.03% \n
Agora Post: https://commonwealth.im/terra/discussion/6700-terra-stablecoin-infrastructure-proposal-by-stably ⚠️ 

This proposal outlines two solutions for the Terra community:

A natively-issued USD-backed stablecoin for Terra 2.0 ⚠️  ($USDS)

A fiat-to-stablecoin gateway for Terra dApps & wallets (Stably Ramp)

$USDS is issued via Stably and Prime Trust, our regulated trust company partner and qualified custodian. It is a compliant stablecoin that is backed 1-to-1 with USD funds held by Prime Trust, with monthly collateral attestations done by Cohen & Co. It securely bridges liquidity to the other blockchains that $USDS is issued natively on, such as Ethereum, Harmony, Stellar, and 7 more, with Ripple and Polymesh coming soon. 

Stably Ramp is a multichain on/off ramp widget that supports 200+ countries with a wide variety of payment methods accepted and lower fees than the competition. $USDS and Stably Ramp together not only bridge TradFi with DeFi but bridge the Terra ecosystem to many other emerging blockchains.

Please refer to the Agora post for a full summary, as well as questions addressed in the comments section.

We will also be answering additional questions via the Agora post as well as Terra’ Discord throughout the week.

The community benefits as users get rewarded based on their onchain activities and loyalty. 60% of the funds will be sent upfront upon the passing of the proposal and the remaining 40% will only be distributed after the public beta is launched. A “Yes” vote signals support for the proposal and the team’s scope according to what is defined on the Agora post: https://agora.terra.money/discussion/7144-genie-rewards-distribution-platform-community-grant-by-coinhall

Redacted: Redacted Money allows users to grant themselves anonymity through a trustless decentralized smart contract based on a zero-Knowledge solution. This proposal to the community aims to achieve Redacted's goals. The main objective is to deliver an Inter- and Cross-chain privacy solution that is going to provide a use case for people using all sorts of chains being routed through Terra and thereby driving volume, which offers anonymous bridging. We will achieve this by integrating off-chain tokens through partners like Axelar and make mixing from and to other chains possible. This is unprecedented in the privacy space. The requested 400,000 $LUNA is given to us in exchange for 1,000,000 (1M) $RED (10% of the supply) to a multi-sig managed by the community (later Community Pool) and will be divided as follows: 50% upfront for runway to finish urgent tasks like finishing revenue sharing and starting cross-chain compatibility - 50% is vested linearly over a period of three (3) months to finish cross-chain compatibility and improving privacy for $LUNA redactors especially. More info about our Goals and spends can be found in our agora discussion: https://agora.terra.money/discussion/7675-redacted-grant-proposal-progress-so-far ⚠️

BTSG/OSMO (Pool 573) ~8333.33  BTSG per day corresponding to ~$2000 per day based on the current price at the current value of $0,24 x BTSG
BTSG/ATOM (Pool 574) ~8333.33 BTSG per day corresponding to ~$2000 per day based on the current price at the current value of $0,24 x BTSG
BTSG/UST (Pool 592) ~8333.33 BTSG per day corresponding to ~ $2000 per day based on the current price at the current value of $0,24 x BTSG

**If this proposal passes:**
XKI:OSMO pool 577 and the XKI:UST pool 578 will benefit from OSMO matched external incentive.

**External incentive details:**
The Ki Foundation’s external incentive program has allocated a total of 10,000,000 XKI ~$2,000,000 value in external rewards to both pools over a span of 180 epochs.

 - By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to adding OSMO incentives to the ATOM:CHEQ liquidity pool on Osmosis.

**Details**This is a signalling proposal to include the ATOM:CHEQ pair into the set of assets which receive OSMO liquidity incentives, which has been requested by the CHEQ community who are eager to provide liquidity.

The benefit to the Osmosis community from cheqd.io ⚠️  is: The team are experts in digital identity, specifically self-sovereign identity (SSI) where the individual holds their own data, following the ""Hold your own keys"" mantra. In a short span of time, they have established partnerships with some of the largest digital identity and SSI software vendors in the world. They want to bring identity to the IBC stack in a way that preserves user privacy and bring Cosmos to the SSI community.

Currently, there are OSMO incentives as well as CHEQ external incentives on CHEQ:OSMO (pool #602). The CHEQ community has added CHEQ external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ (pool #617) and would request the support of the Osmosis community to add OSMO incentives to pool 617.

A previous version of this proposal was submitted with a mismatched title with the feedback provided by the Osmosis community that this should be corrected and resubmitted: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/144 ⚠️

Reducing the Impact of Volume Manipulation
Voting Start: Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:22:33 UTC
Voting End: Sun, 20 Feb 2022 18:22:33 UTC
👍 34.43%, 👎 2.82%, 🕊️ 62.7%, ❌ 0.03% \n
Voting YES for this proposal indicates acceptance of measures to restrict volume manipulation on Osmosis as well as the use of the linked new Master Incentive sheet. \n\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that volume manipulation should not be restricted by Osmosis governance and/or disapproval of the new linked Master incentive sheet. \n\n Background \n\n Osmosis determines how much it it spends on a pool's incentives based on the swap fees generated in order to encourage liquidity to the most useful pool. \n Wash Trading is the practice of swapping tokens within a pool for the sole purpose of artificially increasing the volume traded within that pool. \n Wash Trading is therefore a dishonest way of increasing the incentives allocated to a pool which does not need additional liquidity to cater for genuine traders. \n\n Proposal \n\n This proposal has 3 linked parts. \n\n 1. Agreement that Wash Trading will be penalised by Osmosis Governance in forms such as, but not limited to: \n - Early completion of the onboarding period to limit the effectiveness of any wash trading \n - Manual fixing of a pool's incentives to be in line with its TVL \n - Full removal of incentives from a pool. \n\n 2. Reduction in the effectiveness of Wash Trading by limiting the Swap Fee used in the subsidy model to 3x the average swap fee across Osmosis \n - This limits the APRs caused by irregular trading whilst also still maintaining high APRs in genuinely popular pools. \n\n 3. Adoption of a new Incentive Master sheet with an improved layout \n - No changes to how incentives are calculated beyond the addition of the swap fee cap in Column Y \n - Overview page to see at a glance APR changes \n - Layout change of Calculations with notes to help better explain why changes are happening. \n - External incentives now pulled in from chain data \n - Maturity based on a start date of incentives rather than manual adjustment \n\n Proposed Spreadsheet is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1el4vImD9KqerdiUBbjG2tz_84Sx7XIxy2Lpg6HC5qrU ⚠️  \n\n Commonwealth Discussion here: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3758-handling-incentive-allocation-on-smaller-pools ⚠️

Osmosis v7 Carbon Upgrade

# Osmosis Carbon Upgrade\n\nThis proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the  v7.0.0 https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `3401000`, which is estimated to occur on February 28, UTC 8:00PM. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \n\n## Upgrade features\n\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n* Superfluid Staking\n* Permissioned CosmWasm\n* IAVL improvements (improved epoch times)\n* UX improvements around LP bonding\n\nSee more in the  changelog https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v7.0.0/CHANGELOG.md\n\n## ⚠️  Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\nAll nodes will require 64GB of memory. This must consist of a **minimum** of 32GB of RAM, while the remaining 32GB can be swap. For best results, use 64GB of physical memory. Note that this is **double the recommendation for the Boron upgrade**. Also note that the inclusion of wasm means that nodes must use amd64 to run.\n\nPlease refer to the following setup instructions on how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade:  Upgrade Guide https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md.\n\nNamely ⚠️ , configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you should install the v1.0.0 release of cosmovisor) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd`  `v7.0.0` https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0 ⚠️  ⚠️  binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin/`.\n\nIf you do not wish to use cosmovisor, be prepared to upgrade at around 8:00PM UTC, February 28th if this proposal passes.\n\nThe Osmosis blockchain will halt when network reaches the halt height. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v7.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\n## Details of upgrade time\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `3401000`, anticipated to be at `Monday February 28th 8:00PM UTC`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.46 ⚠️  seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 120 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\n\n\n### Superfluid delegation \n\nIn this upgrade""s superfluid module, you can stake LP shares for specific governance-approved pools. A ""superfluid discount factor"" parameter exists for the superfluid module to ensure stability in the early rollout of superfluid staking, the superfluid discount factor parameter is set to 50% in this upgrade. This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.\n\nThe user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.\n\nHere is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:\n\n#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing\n*Condition*\n- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.\n- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.\n- Suppose you have designated validator ""Dogemosis"" as your superfluid validator.\n- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%\n\n*Result*\n- Your delegation to ""Dogemosis"" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.\n- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.\n- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ⚠️  ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares. In essence, effective slashing rate increases to the lower the risk factor is set to.\n\n#### On Changes to the delegation amount depending on changes in spot price\nLets now suppose the spot price in the pool changes during this epoch to be 1 ATOM = 1 OSMO, and your LP share changes to being `(75 OSMO, 75 ATOM)`. Upon the next epoch, the effective staked OSMO amount will be calculated as `75 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 67.5 ⚠️  OSMO` to reflect the change in the underlying OSMO amount of the LP token.\n\nAs the amount of OSMO backing the LP share increased (hence increasing the effective superfluid staked amount), the staking rewards will also increase.

Also note that the inclusion of wasm means that nodes must use amd64 to run.\n\nPlease refer to the following setup instructions on how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md).\n\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you should install the v1.0.0 release of cosmovisor) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v7.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin/`.\n\nIf you do not wish to use cosmovisor, be prepared to upgrade at around 8:00PM UTC, February 28th if this proposal passes.\n\nThe Osmosis blockchain will halt when network reaches the halt height. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v7.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\n## Details of upgrade time\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `3401000`, anticipated to be at `Monday February 28th 8:00PM UTC`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.46 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 120 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\n\n\n### Superfluid delegation \n\nIn this upgrade""s superfluid module, you can stake LP shares for specific governance-approved pools. A ""superfluid discount factor"" parameter exists for the superfluid module to ensure stability in the early rollout of superfluid staking, the superfluid discount factor parameter is set to 50% in this upgrade. This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.\n\nThe user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.\n\nHere is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:\n\n#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing\n*Condition*\n- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.\n- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.\n- Suppose you have designated validator ""Dogemosis"" as your superfluid validator.\n- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%\n\n*Result*\n- Your delegation to ""Dogemosis"" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.\n- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.\n- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares. In essence, effective slashing rate increases to the lower the risk factor is set to.\n\n#### On Changes to the delegation amount depending on changes in spot price\nLets now suppose the spot price in the pool changes during this epoch to be 1 ATOM = 1 OSMO, and your LP share changes to being `(75 OSMO, 75 ATOM)`. Upon the next epoch, the effective staked OSMO amount will be calculated as `75 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 67.5 OSMO` to reflect the change in the underlying OSMO amount of the LP token.\n\nAs the amount of OSMO backing the LP share increased (hence increasing the effective superfluid staked amount), the staking rewards will also increase.",0,description
"Osmosis v7 Carbon Upgrade

# Osmosis Carbon Upgrade\n\nThis proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the [v7.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `3401000`, which is estimated to occur on February 28, UTC 8:00PM. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \n\n## Upgrade features\n\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n* Superfluid Staking\n* Permissioned CosmWasm\n* IAVL improvements (improved epoch times)\n* UX improvements around LP bonding\n\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v7.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\nAll nodes will require 64GB of memory.

Osmosis Carbon Neutrality through Purchasing and Retiring NCT
Voting Start: Thu, 17 Mar 2022 19:30:57 UTC
Voting End: Sun, 20 Mar 2022 19:30:57 UTC
👍 90.16%, 👎 2.65%, 🕊️ 7%, ❌ 0.16% \n
Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval to address Osmosis’ carbon emissions footprint by purchasing 1 year of carbon credits at worst case projections through Regen Network
Voting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated.
Based on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, Osmosis is projected to emit at most 5,100 tons a year in carbon, negatively affecting our climate. Regen Network, in partnership with Toucan and Moss.Earth ⚠️ , have already launched a version of NCT on Polygon at a price of $10 per credit.
This proposal asks for a spend of 6,600 $OSMO from the Community Pool to purchase 5,100 NCT from Regen Network to cover Osmosis’ historical carbon emissions, confirming Osmosis' carbon neutrality blockchain up to June 2022.

Method
 These funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of 
Cory Levinson (Regen Network)
Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)
NosNode (Osmosis Validator)

The $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase NCT. This will then be retired to offset Osmosis’ carbon emissions.
Any $OSMO remaining due to price fluctuations below the intentional 20% buffer to mitigate any price volatility, and a potentially lower NCT cost, will be returned to the Osmosis Community Pool.

"Match External Incentives for SWTH/OSMO


**Proposal Details**

Match external incentives provided by Carbon for [SWTH/OSMO (#651)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/651). External incentives will begin on 23 March 2022 and will continue for 70 epochs.

- By voting YES on this proposal, external SWTH incentives will be matched at 1,578 USD per day.
- By voting NO on this proposal, external SWTH incentives will NOT be matched at 1,578 USD per day.

**Context**

The Carbon team has provided external incentives amounting to 6,000,000 SWTH for the [SWTH/OSMO pool (#651)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/651) over the course of 70 epochs, beginning on 23 March 2022, which is valued at approximately 110,520 USD in total, at the current price of 0.01842 USD.

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for 1,578 USD per day.

Establish Carbon Market on Osmosis
Voting Start: Wed, 23 Mar 2022 19:26:32 UTC
Voting End: Sat, 26 Mar 2022 19:26:32 UTC
👍 98.33%, 👎 0.24%, 🕊️ 1.34%, ❌ 0.07% \n
Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval of a joint funding venture with Regen Network to establish deep liquidity of a Carbon Market on Osmosis through protocol owned liquidity and pool incentives. 

 Voting NO to his proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated. 

Based on feedback from validators collected by Regen, the Cosmos ecosystem is projected to cause, at most, 84,700 tons a year of carbon dioxide emissions with an estimate of 22,596.5 ⚠️  tons of emissions.
In order to provide sufficient liquidity for any Cosmos chain or validator to choose to offset their project for multiple years it is proposed that liquidity of 211,750 NCT is established, owned between the Osmosis and Regen governance.
Regen Network intend to match any protocol owned liquidity in the NCT/REGEN pool and so to meet this target Osmosis would purchase 105,875 NCT at an estimated price of $10 a credit, as well as utilizing around 1.235 ⚠️  Million REGEN of the 1,399,507 gifted to the Osmosis community pool as an pooling pair.
The NCT/REGEN pool has been chosen as a non-incentivized pool. Due to Osmosis paying for liquidity based on fees, any fees generated by trading in this pool would result in Osmosis paying to incentivize liquidity that is not needed due to the unbonded protocol liquidity. This instead can act as a source of both tokens to seed other, incentivized pools, to increase liquidity and so stability of both NCT and REGEN across Osmosis as a whole through arbitrage.
As an added benefit, based on average swap fees, around 5,400 NCT would be acquired by this community pool held liquidity per year. A portion of this can be routinely retired and cause Osmosis’ carbon neutrality to be self-sustaining.
The remaining REGEN will be used to incentivize the NCT/OSMO pool to attract deeper liquidity, an arbitrage option for NCT/REGEN and a route to the Osmosis base pair for ease of trading. Around 165,000 REGEN should remain in the community pool after the previous two proposals, providing incentives of approximately $1,500 per day for 90 days.
Including a 20% buffer for price volatility, this proposal asks for a community pool spend of 140,000 $OSMO and 1,399,507 $REGEN to establish the Osmosis’ community pool share of this liquidity.
In order to ensure that supply and demand do not place an artificial premium on NCT, the pools will only become available on Osmosis once the ability to tokenise existing offchain carbon credits, non-custodially bridge NCT from Polygon across to the IBC and retire NCT on Regen is fully available to the average user through frontend tooling. This spend is being requested early as the cost of a Carbon Credit has recently been lower than usual and so Osmosis will be able to purchase this liquidity at a reduced rate in preparation for a coordinated launch.

Benefits to Osmosis
 The spend would be retained in the community pool as protocol owned liquidity and so no value should be lost from this proposal.
Swap fees in this pool, at Osmosis average, would generate around $54,000 in revenue each year for the protocol.
 Retiring a portion of this revenue each year will ensure that Osmosis remains carbon neutral permanently.
 Through encouraging use of the Regen Network, the value of Osmosis protocol owned liquidity will increase to cater for projects yet to be connected via IBC. 

Method
These funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of 
   Cory Levinson (Regen Network)
   Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)
    Nos Node (Osmosis Validator)

The $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase the NCT.
The NCT and any remaining $OSMO will then be returned to the multisig address on Osmosis.
200 $OSMO will then be used to establish NCT/REGEN and a OSMO/NCT pool on Osmosis. These costs are paid into the community pool.
All of the $NCT will then be paired with $REGEN in a ratio to maintain the purchase price of $NCT.
The GAMM tokens for NCT/REGEN will then be returned, unbonded, to the Osmosis Community Pool, along with any remaining $OSMO tokens.
Any remaining REGEN will be loaded as external incentives on the OSMO/NCT pool over a 90 day period, start time to be determined when NCT on Regen is fully live.

"Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval of a joint funding venture with Regen Network to establish deep liquidity of a Carbon Market on Osmosis through protocol owned liquidity and pool incentives. 

 Voting NO to his proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated. 

Based on feedback from validators collected by Regen, the Cosmos ecosystem is projected to cause, at most, 84,700 tons a year of carbon dioxide emissions with an estimate of 22,596.5 tons of emissions.
In order to provide sufficient liquidity for any Cosmos chain or validator to choose to offset their project for multiple years it is proposed that liquidity of 211,750 NCT is established, owned between the Osmosis and Regen governance.
Regen Network intend to match any protocol owned liquidity in the NCT/REGEN pool and so to meet this target Osmosis would purchase 105,875 NCT at an estimated price of $10 a credit, as well as utilizing around 1.235 Million REGEN of the 1,399,507 gifted to the Osmosis community pool as an pooling pair.
The NCT/REGEN pool has been chosen as a non-incentivized pool. Due to Osmosis paying for liquidity based on fees, any fees generated by trading in this pool would result in Osmosis paying to incentivize liquidity that is not needed due to the unbonded protocol liquidity. This instead can act as a source of both tokens to seed other, incentivized pools, to increase liquidity and so stability of both NCT and REGEN across Osmosis as a whole through arbitrage.
As an added benefit, based on average swap fees, around 5,400 NCT would be acquired by this community pool held liquidity per year. A portion of this can be routinely retired and cause Osmosis’ carbon neutrality to be self-sustaining.
The remaining REGEN will be used to incentivize the NCT/OSMO pool to attract deeper liquidity, an arbitrage option for NCT/REGEN and a route to the Osmosis base pair for ease of trading. Around 165,000 REGEN should remain in the community pool after the previous two proposals, providing incentives of approximately $1,500 per day for 90 days.
Including a 20% buffer for price volatility, this proposal asks for a community pool spend of 140,000 $OSMO and 1,399,507 $REGEN to establish the Osmosis’ community pool share of this liquidity.
In order to ensure that supply and demand do not place an artificial premium on NCT, the pools will only become available on Osmosis once the ability to tokenise existing offchain carbon credits, non-custodially bridge NCT from Polygon across to the IBC and retire NCT on Regen is fully available to the average user through frontend tooling. This spend is being requested early as the cost of a Carbon Credit has recently been lower than usual and so Osmosis will be able to purchase this liquidity at a reduced rate in preparation for a coordinated launch.

Benefits to Osmosis
 The spend would be retained in the community pool as protocol owned liquidity and so no value should be lost from this proposal.
Swap fees in this pool, at Osmosis average, would generate around $54,000 in revenue each year for the protocol.
 Retiring a portion of this revenue each year will ensure that Osmosis remains carbon neutral permanently.
 Through encouraging use of the Regen Network, the value of Osmosis protocol owned liquidity will increase to cater for projects yet to be connected via IBC.

Launch the Osmosis Grants Program

By voting **YES**, the OGP will be launched with 1,500,000 OSMO tokens from the community pool.

By voting **NO**, OSMO holders voice their dissent against the OGP.

**Details**
- An Osmosis Grants Program (“OGP”) should be launched to fund new community-built tooling, infrastructure and projects building on top of Osmosis.

- We propose an initial budget for the program of up to 1,500,000 OSMO tokens for a 6 month program with quarterly community review. OGP is not obligated to spend this amount; quality always comes first.

- Funds will be managed by a 7 person multi-sig consisting of:
- Sunny Aggarwal (Osmosis team)
- Figment
- Eddie Hartmann (Osmosis team)
- Cosmostation
- Brandon Curtis (Independent)
- Coldchain (Independent)
- Dan Elitzer (Nascent)

- At the end of the initial six month term and then every quarter thereafter, the community can terminate the program via governance and any unspent OSMO tokens will be returned to the community pool.

- The program would be run by a Program Lead (Reverie) supported by seven reviewers, who also function as the multi-sig. Reverie has been working closely with the Osmosis team and the committee for the past few months for setup.

- Reverie proposes monthly compensation of $70k while it is administering the OGP as well a $100k one time setup grant to permit best in class legal and operational setup.

- As part of this proposal, weve included a preliminary version of the website, as well as an initial set of funding RFP ideas.

Multihop Discount on Osmosis Pools
Voting Start: Thu, 31 Mar 2022 16:44:41 UTC

Voting Yes for this proposal indicates that a multihop discount should be adopted when OSMO is the intermediary token\n\nVoting No for this proposal indicates that the current swap fee structure should remain in place\n\nThis proposal is to develop and implement a multihop discount on OSMO pools to provide traders with the lowest fee possible and promote the use of OSMO pools.\nWhen a trade consists of just two OSMO pools during a single transaction, the swap fees would be automatically halved.

Signalling Proposal for SWTH/OSMO(#651) Incentivized Pools
Voting Start: Tue, 05 Apr 2022 03:06:44 UTC

Proposal for adding base OSMO rewards to the SWTH/OSMO (#651) pool. Rewards are based on swap fees collected on a rolling weekly basis, essentially a trade volume-based incentives allocation.

**Proposal details**
Signalling proposal for a SWTH incentivized pool.

- By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to the SWTH/OSMO (#651) pool on Osmosis.
- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the SWTH/OSMO (#651) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**
This is a signalling proposal to include the SWTH/OSMO (#651) pool into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. After this proposal has passed governance, this SWTH pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

**About Carbon (SWTH)**

Carbon is a protocol that powers cross-chain financial markets and ecosystems. As a custom-purposed blockchain, Carbon is designed specifically to allow trading of sophisticated financial instruments such as options, bonds and futures at scale. Developers can also build any kind of DeFi application on top of Carbon, while enjoying multi-chain interoperability. Carbon is currently integrated across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Zilliqa, Neo, as well as any IBC-compatible chain such as Osmosis, Terra, and Cosmos Hub. Carbon currently powers decentralized, cross-chain order-book trading of spot and futures markets on Demex.

Since the addition of the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis last month, the pool has already garnered over USD 1.72m in liquidity, with a 7D average trading volume of USD 137k.

Via Carbon governance, additional SWTH rewards have been allocated to the OSMO/BUSD spot liquidity pool on Carbon, as well as the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis.

Signaling proposal to add Cerberus (CRBRUS) pool 662 to the Osmosis incentives program
Voting Start: Tue, 19 Apr 2022 20:40:03 UTC

👍 67.35%, 👎 12.92%, 🕊️ 19.57%, ❌ 0.14% \n
**Proposal details**
Signaling proposal for CRBRUS incentivized pool.

By voting **YES** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO incentives to the CRBRUS/OSMO (#662) pool on Osmosis.

By voting **NO** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the CRBRUS/OSMO (#662) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**
This is a signaling proposal to include the **CRBRUS/OSMO** (#662) pool into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. This proposal results from the community lobbying to submit a proposal to have incentives added to the pool to help develop liquidity. In addition, the community feels that the upcoming airdrop to OSMO stakers will help generate further liquidity in the pool by having incentives and incentivizing those who provide liquidity. After this proposal has passed governance, this CRBRUS pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

**Current External Incentives**
Cerberus stakers have already voted on a proposal for external incentives on pool #662. Starting April 4, 2022, 1.75 ⚠️  billion CRBRUS had been added to the pools’ gauges for external incentives to be divided over 180 epochs for liquidity providers.

1-day bonding period, 250 billion CRBRUS has been allocated to external incentives
7-day bonding period, 500 billion CRBRUS has been allocated to external incentives
14-day bonding period, 1 billion CRBRUS has been allocated to external incentives

**About Cerberus (CRBRUS)**
**Cerberus** is a sovereign layer-1 chain and the first-ever three-headed meme-coin to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. The project launched on March 15, 2022, to the public, focusing on being a community-focused meme-coin and NFT project that allows the community to vote on various governance proposals to determine the chain's development. The project's roadmap for the second half of 2022 will primarily focus on the upcoming Cerberus NFT collections. The first NFT collection will launch on the OmniFlix network sometime in Q2. Users will also be able to use Cerberus in the future as a utility token on the OmniFlix network. Other partnerships are currently in the works to expand the use-case of Cerberus as a utility token on other networks.

The project's roadmap for the second half of 2022 will primarily focus on the upcoming Cerberus NFT collections. The first NFT collection will launch on the OmniFlix network sometime in Q2. Users will also be able to use Cerberus in the future as a utility token on the OmniFlix network. Other partnerships are currently in the works to expand the use-case of Cerberus as a utility token on other networks.

Canonical Ethereum Bridge Provider: Approval Voting Procedures & Reciprocal Expectations for Bridge Provision
Voting Start: Wed, 20 Apr 2022 20:02:06 UTC
Voting End: Mon, 25 Apr 2022 20:02:06 UTC
👍 99.37%, 👎 0.27%, 🕊️ 0.33%, ❌ 0.01% \n
Voting YES to this Proposal means that you assent to using the following procedures to vote for a Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider (BSP) for app.osmosis.zone ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ , a relationship whose initial, mutable expectations are outlined below.\n\nVoting NO means you do not assent to these procedures and expectations. VETO and ABSTAIN have their normal functions.\n\nLIMITATION OF SCOPE: A YES vote assents to these procedures ONLY for the series of five Osmosis governance proposals outlined below. To guard against malicious or confusing proposals, only proposals made by osmo19mywfjzj324w5ukf7ss6jak0dg9hnljfp0rfx4 will be considered under these rules. Future use of these (or similar) procedures must be separately approved by governance.\n\nAPPROVAL VOTING PROCEDURES: Five Osmosis Governance Proposals will be proposed under these rules, one each for the four bridge service providers being voted upon: 1) Axelar, 2) Gravity Bridge, 3) Nomad, and 4) Wormhole, as well as 5) a “do nothing” proposal.\n\nWINNER: The Bridge Service Provider (BSP) proposal (or “do nothing”) from this set that receives the highest total amount of YES voting power at the end of the collective voting period will win, provided that QUORUM is reached and a RUN-OFF is not activated. That BSP will enter into a relationship with Osmosis DAO whose initial parameters are outlined below.\n\nNO, NO WITH VETO, and ABSTAIN votes will have NO EFFECT on the tally of yes voting power for the approval voting results. In other words, a bridge could win the approval vote even if it has more NO/VETO vote power than YES, as long as it has the most YES voting power among the BSP proposals.\n\nQUORUM: As long as the total YES voting power received across the 5 approval voting proposals is equivalent to regular Osmosis quorum (20% of total Osmosis voting power), quorum will be considered to have been reached.\n\nRUN-OFF: At the end of the collective voting period, any BSP or “do nothing” proposal that has received within 15% of the leading proposal’s total will be entered into a run-off governed by these same rules and expectations, except that the run-off result will be final, with no further run-offs. This 15% will be measured as a percentage of the total voting power available on Osmosis for this set of proposals (NOT 15% of the top vote-getter’s YES voting power).\nFor example, assuming 122M total staked OSMO available to vote, the 15% run-off spread is 18.3M. Therefore, if Bridge X gets 53M YES voting power, Bridge Y gets 35M, and Bridge Z gets 25M, Bridges X and Y will be entered into a run-off.\n\nBRIDGE SERVICE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP EXPECTATIONS:\nThe Osmosis DAO is asking Osmosis Labs to integrate the BSP into app.osmosis.zone ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  to provide canonical, unprefixed bridged assets from Ethereum. The implementation details will be left to Osmosis Labs and the chosen BSP, but the general shape of the initial expectations is as follows. These expectations are subject to change as circumstance, future governance, and social consensus dictate.\n\nFrom Osmosis, the BSP can expect:\nDefault Asset List – the Ethereum assets bridged by the selected provider will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  default asset list – i.e. their bridged ETH and ERC-20 assets will be ETH, USDC, etc., all other bridges' assets would be bridge1ETH, bridge2USDC, and the like. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions. In the near future, we expect custom token lists to become the norm in Cosmos, as they are on Ethereum, so that users can search for and import tokens that they want to interact with.\nOsmosis Incentives – the DAO commits to prioritizing the assets of the canonical bridge, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools–under the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.\nIntegration – Osmosis expects to work closely with the BSP. At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).\n\nFrom the BSP, Osmosis can expect:\nIntegration / Availability – the BSP will help optimize integrations in a timely manner in accordance with Osmosis’ stated goals of achieving deposits and withdrawals from the app.osmosis.zone ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  UI and Keplr Wallet (without pass-through to the bridge UI).\nLiquidity Mining Incentives – if a project’s proposal included the promise of incentives (e.g. Axelar, at least 1% of Axelar tokens to be used for incentives on Osmosis).\n\nRevocability / At-will / Permissionless: As noted, these expectations are preliminary and subject to change as the DAO, developers, and the bridge team see fit. Osmosis DAO and the BSP will be working with each other for their mutual benefit, without contractual promise or obligation. It will be up to the BSP team to maintain a good relationship with Osmosis Labs regarding the front-end implementation details. Osmosis DAO empowers Osmosis Labs to change BSPs if in their estimation, the relationship has become unworkable, or the technical landscape suggests a superior solution, subject to ratification by the DAO.\nShould the arrangement become unworkable for either party for whatever reason, the arrangement can be changed or terminated without notice. Any damages for bad behavior (broken promises, bridge failures) will be to reputation alone. Specific promises between the BSP and an individual user (e.g. bridge insurance) are not covered by this disclaimer, nor are potential future agreements between the DAO and various developers, teams, or individuals.\n\nFurther details and discussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4482-osmosis-canonical-ethereum-bridge-proposals ⚠️

The use of OSMO pools as the optimal trade route for user purchases is beneficial for Osmosis.\n Ideally this would be voted on purely by Pool 1 Liquidity Providers, however pool sub-governance is not functional yet and so this will be asked of all Osmosis governance and implemented during the next software upgrade if passed. \n Pool 1 Liquidity Providers specifically should see compensatory swap fees generated from the new routes passing through the pool as well as increased frequency of volatility harvesting as mentioned in the multihop proposal.\n\n Affected routes:\n From Identical swap fees to Multihop being having lower swap fees: ATOM/JUNO, ATOM/STARS, ATOM/CMDX, ATOM/LUM, ATOM/NGM, ATOM/IOV\n From higher swap fees in Multihop to Identical swap fees: ATOM/IXO, ATOM/DEC, ATOM/CHEQ\n\n For a full comparison of the swap fees by route before and after the change proposed see here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFI4S5wqDoC-WiUbWoLJ0dRbylqbvQ1ZTjpiN71lkGA\n\nFurther details and discussion: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4340-reduce-osmoatom-pool-swap-fee-to-02",0,title_and_description

Make Osmosis the Co-Lead Sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022

Summary:

If this signaling proposal passes, the funding provided by Osmosis proposal #110 will be used to make the Osmosis community the co-lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022.

Description:

Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world and raise more awareness of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. This year’s Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia - on September 27 & 28.
Just as last year, Cosmoverse will keep a strong community spirit. We aim to bring the Cosmos community together in one room with core Cosmos builders. The community will be able to ask questions, listen to keynote speeches, and talk to Cosmos core developers face to face. This also gives Cosmos projects the opportunity to strengthen their relationship with the community.

Why should the funds from prop #110 be used for sponsorship?

Prop #110 was submitted by NosNodes (https://twitter.com/NosNodes ⚠️ ) with the purpose to incentivize more community building by the Cosmoverse team. Thank you, NosNodes! <3

After Prop #110 passed, the Cosmoverse team received 20,000 OSMO in funding. We are extremely grateful for that. 
We were able to use the funds to organize meetups (like the Denver Meetup: https://twitter.com/CosmoverseHQ/status/1495248152865042434?s=20&t=MZgUGjZuO6tkZBDB5Jmnqw ⚠️ ), pay the initial deposit for the Medellin conference and cover travel expenses. 
Without Osmosis, Cosmoverse would never have become what it is today.

How does it benefit the Osmosis community?

The funds from Osmosis prop #110 will make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.

- Keynote speech: We offer two keynote slots to the Osmosis core team. Speakers TBA on our official Twitter account.
- Booth in networking area: We offer Osmosis a prominent booth stand in the main networking area.
- Logo placement: The Osmosis logo will be shown as “co-lead sponsor at the conference.
- General Admission Tickets: We will give 10 general admission tickets to the Osmosis core team or the Osmosis community. Distribution TBD.
- Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.
- Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

You decide:

- By voting “Yes” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.
- By voting “No” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should not be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

"Summary:

If this signaling proposal passes, the funding provided by Osmosis proposal #110 will be used to make the Osmosis community the co-lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022.

Description:

Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world and raise more awareness of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. This year’s Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia - on September 27 & 28.
Just as last year, Cosmoverse will keep a strong community spirit. We aim to bring the Cosmos community together in one room with core Cosmos builders. The community will be able to ask questions, listen to keynote speeches, and talk to Cosmos core developers face to face. This also gives Cosmos projects the opportunity to strengthen their relationship with the community.

Why should the funds from prop #110 be used for sponsorship?

Prop #110 was submitted by NosNodes (https://twitter.com/NosNodes) with the purpose to incentivize more community building by the Cosmoverse team. Thank you, NosNodes! <3

After Prop #110 passed, the Cosmoverse team received 20,000 OSMO in funding. We are extremely grateful for that. 
We were able to use the funds to organize meetups (like the Denver Meetup: https://twitter.com/CosmoverseHQ/status/1495248152865042434?s=20&t=MZgUGjZuO6tkZBDB5Jmnqw), pay the initial deposit for the Medellin conference and cover travel expenses. 
Without Osmosis, Cosmoverse would never have become what it is today.

How does it benefit the Osmosis community?

The funds from Osmosis prop #110 will make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.

- Keynote speech: We offer two keynote slots to the Osmosis core team. Speakers TBA on our official Twitter account.
- Booth in networking area: We offer Osmosis a prominent booth stand in the main networking area.
- Logo placement: The Osmosis logo will be shown as “co-lead sponsor at the conference.
- General Admission Tickets: We will give 10 general admission tickets to the Osmosis core team or the Osmosis community. Distribution TBD.
- Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.
- Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

You decide:

- By voting “Yes” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.
- By voting “No” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should not be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

Osmosis Proposals #222, #223, and #224 propose to shift incentives from the OSMO/UST, OSMO/LUNA, and LUNA/UST pools towards the OSMO/USDC, OSMO/ETH, and OSMO/DAI pools. These incentives are crucial to help shift Osmosis liquidity away from Terra-based assets towards Ethereum-based stablecoins and major assets. However, these proposals are normal incentive adjustment proposals that go through the normal 5 day voting process (meaning they won't go into effect for 6 epochs).\n \n Because of the extremely volatile market conditions around Terra, we propose that we accelerate this process by using an 'emergency software upgrade' under special fast-voting rules to allow the incentives to shift faster than the normal 5 day voting period.\n \n The 'fast-voting process' would take the form of being enacted as soon as 2/3 of *total chain voting power* votes Yes on this proposal. At that time, if >2/3 of total voting power has voted Yes on each of #222, #223, and #224, then those proposals will be enabled during the upgrade process.  For example, if and once this proposal receives 66.6 ⚠️ % of voting power as Yes, if proposals #222 and #224 have >2/3 voting power, they would both be enacted during the upgrade process.\n \n The process of upgrade would involve a height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary, similar to the v6.0 upgrade. Validators/node operators can change the binary during v7 operations, if the fork is approved. The v8.0 software version will be fully state-compatible with *v8.0* until the divergence block.\n \n No upgrade timeline or software patch should be released until 67% of governance approval has voted yes on this proposal. If so, validators should coordinate to attempt to find a time that suffices for this upgrade. (And importantly _verify_ all changes in this upgrade meet governance approvals)\n \n All validators, and full node operators should update their software to version *v8.0* as soon as possible once 67% of voting power has been reached, the changes have been accepted, and they have verified the code. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal to signal their readiness.\n \n Failure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\n \n Related commonwealth proposals: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4864-ust-derisking-proposal ⚠️ , https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4867-proposals-for-shifting-a-portion-of-liquidity-incentives-from-ust-and-luna-towards-usdc-dai-and-eth\n ⚠️  \n * Voting YES for this proposal indicates agreement for Osmosis validators to coordinate and perform an emergency upgrade to Osmosis, as authorised by greater than two-thirds of governance approval under the fast-voting conditions outlined above.\n \n * Voting NO for this proposal indicates that Osmosis should continue without any emergency upgrade action.

Add functionality to allow depooling via emergency upgrade hard fork in proposal #225\n \n Because UST is IBC-native and because bridges to other stablecoins have just now going up, UST has been the predominant stablecoin on Osmosis. UST LP providers thought they were LP'ing with a stablecoin, and now they are facing significant further depeg risk. This proposal seeks to mitigate the IL loss due to the rapid depeg.\n \n UST pools have had unforeseen volatility and due to sigificant full depeg risk, Osmosis users should have a chance to avoid further potential impermanent loss. This proposal gives liquidity providers in these pools the option to take an action to unpool their liquidity in these UST pools if they wish. Unpooling would be a new message action an LP can take on these pools if they were bonded before the emergency proposal time. Unpooling on a 14 day bond will be the equivalent of exiting the pool, and then beginning a 14 day unlock for the constituent assets. This has the affect of confirming any impermanent loss, and will safeguard one half of their remaining liquidity tokens in the event of an asset in the pair going to zero.\n \n Furthermore, by reducing the liqudity between OSMO and UST, it makes the UST->OSMO->ATOM a less liquid exit liquidity path for UST, helping reduce OSMO price impact during further UST depegs.\n \n Governance should be very cautious with this, as its a significant change to Osmosis and may set a dangerous precedent. The change is concerning on multiple fronts, including the fairness to other LP's, using a hard fork for something thats arguably a market design problem, and what is to be expected in the next crash.\n \n Because this process requires a software upgrade and is extremely time sensitive, we propose adding the execution of this to the same mechanism proposed in proposal #225.  Namely, once 2/3 of *total chain voting power* approves proposal #225, if within a short time period, 2/3 of total chain voting power also approves this proposal, then this signals the approval for validators to include functionality enabling depooling in the emergency hard fork.\n \n The list of pools affected is:\n #560 (UST/OSMO)\n #562 (UST/LUNA)\n #567 (UST/EEUR)\n #578 (UST/XKI)\n #592 (UST/BTSG)\n #610 (UST/CMDX)\n #612 (UST/XPRT)\n #615 (UST/LUM)\n #642 (UST/UMEE)\n #679 (4Pool)\n \n Note: This Proposal will consider to be passed based on 67\% of governance voting Yes and failed based on 33\% voting No and so will be eligible for action when this threshold has passed rather than at the end of the voting period.

The change is concerning on multiple fronts, including the fairness to other LP's, using a hard fork for something thats arguably a market design problem, and what is to be expected in the next crash.\n \n Because this process requires a software upgrade and is extremely time sensitive, we propose adding the execution of this to the same mechanism proposed in proposal #225.  Namely, once 2/3 of *total chain voting power* approves proposal #225, if within a short time period, 2/3 of total chain voting power also approves this proposal, then this signals the approval for validators to include functionality enabling depooling in the emergency hard fork.\n \n The list of pools affected is:\n #560 (UST/OSMO)\n #562 (UST/LUNA)\n #567 (UST/EEUR)\n #578 (UST/XKI)\n #592 (UST/BTSG)\n #610 (UST/CMDX)\n #612 (UST/XPRT)\n #615 (UST/LUM)\n #642 (UST/UMEE)\n #679 (4Pool)\n \n Note: This Proposal will consider to be passed based on 67\% of governance voting Yes and failed based on 33\% voting No and so will be eligible for action when this threshold has passed rather than at the end of the voting period.",0,title_and_description

[Action Required] Signalling Proposal for Emergency v8 Upgrade at 4402000

This proposal is for coordination of the emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary as already approved in proposals 225 and 226. It is an emergency upgrade hard fork for adding the unpooling feature for UST pools (prop 226) and shifting OSMO incentives off of LUNA and UST related pools (prop 225, 222-224).

This change has been reviewed by a number of validators and experienced cosmos developers. It has had pretty thorough testing on a testnet given the time constraints.

Addendums to unpooling not specified in 226

Unpooling of locks that are superfluid staked will not have slashing risk to avoid the large amount of code complexity implementing this would create and the time it would take to get implement it securely.

Additionally, it seems to have been the intention of prop 226 to include all UST pools, even though some were not included in the prop 226 text. This seems to have been human error on the proposal creators part. Several validators have signalled being in favor of this through several chats.

Upgrade information

This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The v8.0.0 ⚠️  software version is fully state-compatible with v7.3.0 until the upgrade block 4402000, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v6 upgrade (prop 103), used when the IBC channel creation mechanism was broken.
The proposed upgrade block height of 4402000 is estimated to be at May 15, 2022, 16:00 UTC (Sunday).
All validators, and full node operators should update their software to version v8.0.0 ⚠️  prior to 14:00 UTC (Sunday). After doing so, validators should vote yes on this proposal signalling that they have upgraded.
Failure to do so will cause the node to crash – requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.

Actionable(s)
Every node should upgrade their software version from v7.3.0 to v8.0.0 ⚠️  before the upgrade block height 4402000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at upgrades/v7/bin to be v8.0.0 ⚠️ , and restart the node. Do check that cosmovisor version says 8.0.0 ⚠️ .
Upon upgrading their setup and processing a block, every validator should vote yes on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade.)
Every node should check in at May 15th 2PM (14:00) UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have voted yes on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didn’t upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of the validator voting power has not signalled readiness by 2PM (14:00) UTC, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should revert their binary back to v7.3.0 until further notice.
Furthermore, please review the numbers for the accelerated incentives updates in https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/1481/files#diff-cafe8a3f5831b68ac650982d09609c545f5990c6a1e6602ea4fb5c9bc04aa3bb ⚠️ , and v8 logic.

Failure case and risks involved

In the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - “validators” channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis ⚠️ )

Governance procedure

Voting Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan and that you applied the upgrade and successfully processed a block after.

Voting No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.

n\n Link to commonwealth post https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4722-incentives-repo-process-and-category-model\n\nThis ⚠️  proposal entails two sub proposals.\n\n1. That we overhaul the meta process for generation of adjustment proposals. This has historically been implemented through a series of google spreadsheets implementing each variant of the mechanism, with static copies made for the generation of each proposal. This shall be replaced with a Github repository based process, which will make public tracking of changes easier, and allow for (nearly) full automation of the proposal generation process.\n\n2. That we modify the current mechanism (bias, subsidy, matching, fee cap, etc) to first group pools into categories, each with a parameterized incentive share, and then pools within each category split that share based on their share of fees collected and external incentives.\n\n\n## Github Repository\n\n link to repo https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives/tree/unity/mainnet\n\nThis ⚠️  Github repo will at all times contain at least 3 branches, which (along with some Github Action workflows), serve to automate the process of creating weekly adjustment proposals.\n\nThe `main` branch contains the process and data for the most recent proposal.\n\nThe `staging` branch contains the process for the next proposal.\n\nThroughout the week, PRs are made to `staging` corresponding to on chain text proposals, such as adding pools to onboarding, matching external incentives, or changing the adjustment process.\n\nA `liveview` branch off of staging is continually updated with new data, so that we can see what we expect the next proposal to look like.\n\nAs on chain text proposals pass, their PRs are merged to `staging` (and then merged to the `liveview` branch on the next update).\n\nWhen it is time for a new adjustment proposal, the `liveview` branch is merged back into `staging` (giving it up to date market data). And then `staging` branch is merged into `main`.\n\nThe data in the `main` branch is then used to create the on chain adjustment proposal.\n\n\n\n## Category Model\n\nThis model groups pools into a number of categories with proportional incentive shares, so that we can prioritize certain classes of liquidity directly.\n\n### Target Share\nThe share of incentives allocated to each category is then split according to the proportion of swap fees collected by each pool within the category. These values are limited by the `swap fee cap` (currently 3), such that pools will not benefit by having more than 3x the average fee APR of the category.\n\nWe then recalculate shares using (capped) fees + external incentives collected by the pool. To limit the incentive increase caused by a match relative to the base incentives, we take the minimum of this `adjusted reveneue` share, and `(1 + matched_multiple_cap) * capped_fee_share`.

- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the XPRT/OSMO (#15) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**
This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the XPRT/OSMO (#15). This pool is currently the 26th largest OSMO pool on Osmosis by Total Value Locked containing around 0.4132 ⚠️ % of all OSMO liquidity.
At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~161k OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking.
This proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of these chains sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance.

Persistence is a Tendermint-based Layer-1 chain designed to be the liquid staking hub for the Proof of Stake economy. It facilitates issuance and deployment of liquid-staked stkASSETs, allowing users to earn staking rewards and also participate in DeFi activities.

**Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the Persistence team for XPRT/USDC (pool #719), the external incentives will continue for 45 epochs for 14 days bonding period. 
- By voting YES on this proposal, external XPRT incentives will be matched at ~$9,866 per day
- By voting NO on this proposal, external XPRT incentives will NOT be matched at ~$9,866 per day

**Context**
The Persistence team has allocated 300,000 XPRT across XPRT/USDC pool 719 that amounts to ~$440,000 over the course of 45 epochs (Started on 25-05-2022)
The XPRT incentives are as follows:
- XPRT/USDC (Pool #719): ~6,666 XPRT per day amounting to ~$9,866 .

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$9,866  per day.

* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates that liquidity incentive minimums should be reallocated as below\n\n* Voting No for this proposal indicates that existing liquidity incentive minimums should be unaffected by this proposal\n\nOsmosis Liquidity incentives are distributed daily according to the category model established in Proposal #233 with 45% of the daily incentives going to major/osmo pools.

By voting **Yes**, the Osmosis Grants Program (“OGP”) will receive an additional 7,500,000 OSMO tokens from the community pool.

By voting **No**, OSMO holders voice their dissent against the OGP receiving additional funding.

**Details**
- Osmosis has an opportunity to recruit high-quality teams experienced in CosmWasm that were previously focused on the Terra ecosystem.

- Due to OSMO volatility, the USD value of the original OGP budget has decreased from $12M at the time of launch to $2.3M today.

- Program funds will be managed by the same 7 person multi-sig used for the existing OGP.

## Osmosis Nitrogen Upgrade\n\nThis is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v9.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 4707300, which is estimated to occur on Tuesday June 7th, UTC 16:00.

Fix IBC transfers between Lum Network and Osmosis

This proposal replaces proposal #256. We kindly ask OSMO stakers to consider proposal #256 voided and to reject it in favour of this current proposal.

== Proposal replacement details ==

This new proposal introduces a new IBC client 07-tendermint-1991 to replace legacy client 07-tendermint-1987 on channel Osmosis(115) and LumNetwork(3).
The previous proposal used the legacy client 07-tendermint-1987 which ran into a trusting out-of-period, and thus got voided by protocol.
The Lum team alongside some of the Lum Network validators have now upgraded their tools to frequently update the new client 07-tendermint-1991 and deprecated the periodic updates of legacy one.

== Description ==

Lum Network IBC channel is currently in a frozen state following the Osmosis chain halt of the past few days.
This issue is known and has already been dealt with successfully in January 2022 where it was heavily tested prior to making a governance proposal.
The detail of the previous unfreeze operation is available here: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/115 ⚠️ 

Lum Team is now ready to proceed with a new channel unfreeze to restore connection between Lum & Osmosis.

Proposal goal:

This proposal will enable the unfreezing process of the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network, thus allowing deposits and withdrawals of $LUM on the Osmosis platform:

- By voting YES, OSMO stakers voice their support in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network
- By voting NO, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network

This proposal has no effect beside enabling back the IBC connection between the two chains.

Details:

The IBC client refresh between Osmosis and the Lum Network was not possible during the Osmosis shutdown.
Shutting down the IBC connection froze the currently use channel (3-115). Meaning that no IBC transfer can be made using this channel unless this governance proposal is voted YES by OSMO stakers.
The process to enable IBC transfers back require to substitute the current IBC client by a new one that is not in an expired.

External Incentive Matching reduction within non-OSMO categories

* Voting YES for this proposal indicates that incentive categories not containing OSMO as a component should have external incentive matching capped as follows.\n    * Reduction in the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%\n    * Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ \n\n* Voting NO for this proposal indicates that all incentive categories will continue to be matched at a maximum 1:1 value ratio\n\n**Example:** https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1413b2b3-9d38-4865-8717-ba9a8ba4d0e7.1655974330412 ⚠️  \nAs an example of the proposed model, both FOO/OSMO and FOO/ATOM pools generate 30k per day in swap fees and have 15k provided in external incentives.  Currently Osmosis will match all 15k of these external incentives in both pools.  The line that reads 'Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️ ' causes the FOO/ATOM pools to have 7.5k spent on matching compared to 15k on FOO/OSMO pools.\n This is further limited if the fees generated are lower. In a scenario where both pools generate 5k per day in swap fees, currently, 5k of the 15k external incentives would be matched in both pools.  The line that reads 'Reduction in the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%' causes this 5k to be reduced to 1667 in matching on the FOO/ATOM pool.\ni.e. to achieve full matching the pool would need to generate 45k in swap fees.\nN.B. Example is weightings of fee allocation rather than actual figures.\n\n### Background\nExternal Incentive matching was first established in  Proposal 47 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47 ⚠️  to incentivize their addition to Osmosis pools. This quickly grew into a major driver for incentive allocation following chains such as Stargaze, Chihuahua and Comdex adding large external incentives in comparison to the normal Osmosis incentive structure.\nIn order to preserve incentives for established projects, without external incentives but important for the growth of Osmosis as the IBC decentralised exchange, governance voted in Proposals  128 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/128 ⚠️  and 133 to implement a bias factor around how fees were used to calculate external incentive matching as well as a cap on matched Osmosis incentives relative to un-matched Osmosis incentives\nThe bias factor was defined as:\n\nThe same bias factor that is used for all incentivized pools within Osmosis.

Signaling proposal: Create a osmosis bug bounty

Voting End: Fri, 01 Jul 2022 21:59:23 UTC
👍 99.85%, 👎 0.01%, 🕊️ 0.12%, ❌ 0% \n
## Background\nOn the 8th June 2022 at 02:49:55 UTC a major bug in the osmosis AMM has forced the validators to halt the network at block 4713064. The issue was that withdrawing funds from liquidity pools would result in getting assets worth more than what you had in the pool. This bug could've potentially drained the assets in all liquidity pools accross osmosis by simply adding liquidity and directly removing it again. Fortunately, the damage was limited to only 5 million dollars due to the fast reaction of the validators. However, apart from the financial damage, the 3-day shutdown also cost a lot of trust, which has to be earned again in the long term.\n\n## Bug Bounty/Vulnerability Disclosure Policy\nTo prevent the malicious exploitation of such bugs I would like to propose two things:\n1. **Creation of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**\nThe goal of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy is to encourage people to report bugs privately to the osmosis devs before making it public. Such policy would give information about how osmosis has to react to such bug reports and also give the reporting user the security to no being persecuted legally. I'll add some examples for such policy:\n\n    https://hackerone.com/riot?type=team\n ⚠️     https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/bug-fix-policy\n ⚠️     https://support.crowdin.com/vulnerability-policy/ ⚠️  \n\n2. **Creation of a according but bounty program**\nHaving a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy usually also means having a bug bounty program to incentivise the reporting of such bugs instead of abusing them. The bounty paired with the legal security should then hopefully be enough to ensure critical bugs can be fixed before being disclosed to the public.\nImmunefi is a platform where many crypto projects are running their bug bounty program (Polygon, MakeDAO, THORChain, PancakeSwap, etc.). Also Sifchain is having a bug bounty program there with rewards up to 2M$.\nThis Bug Bounty should be funded by the strategic Osmo reserve and the community pool. Furthermore, core devs and external and independent actors should be involved in the bug bounty dao/team.\n\n\n### Note\nA bug bounty program doesn't mean that reported bugs are swept under the carpet. A vulnerability disclosure policy also includes when and how bugs can/will be disclosed to the public.\n___\nYES -> You aggree that a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure should be created and carried out. The creation itself with the exact policy will have to pass governance again.\nNO -> You believe that's not neccessary and don't want a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure policy\nNO WITH VETO -> You believe such policy/bug bounty would harm the network and want to prevent that at all cost

** Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the Persistence team for XPRT/USDC (pool #719) and XPRT/OSMO (pool #15). The external incentives will continue for 45 epochs for 14 days bonding period. 
- By voting YES on this proposal, external XPRT incentives will be matched at ~$2,666 per day for XPRT/OSMO Pool & XPRT incentives will be matched at ~$4,444 per day for XPRT/USDC Pool
- By voting NO on this proposal, external XPRT incentives will NOT be matched at ~$2,666 per day for XPRT/OSMO Pool & XPRT incentives will NOT be matched at ~$4,444 per day for XPRT/USDC Pool

** Context **
The Persistence team has allocated 400,000 XPRT across XPRT/USDC (pool 719) and XPRT/OSMO (pool 15) that amounts to ~$320,000 over the course of 45 epochs (Started on 08-07-2022)
The XPRT incentives are as follows:
- XPRT/USDC (Pool #719): ~5,555 XPRT per day amounting to ~$4,444.
- XPRT/OSMO (Pool #15): ~3,333 per day amounting to ~$2,666.
Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$7,110  per day.
 
**About Persistence** 
Persistence is a Tendermint-based Layer-1 chain designed to be the liquid staking hub for the Proof of Stake economy. It facilitates issuance and deployment of liquid-staked stkASSETs, allowing users to earn staking rewards and also participate in DeFi activities.

Governance Module Upgrade: Expedited Proposals
Voting Start: Thu, 14 Jul 2022 12:09:04 UTC
Voting End: Tue, 19 Jul 2022 12:09:04 UTC
👍 96.52%, 👎 1.06%, 🕊️ 2.39%, ❌ 0.01% \n
* By voting **Yes**, you agree to the governance module changes listed below, allowing them to be enabled during the next upgrade.\n\n* By voting **No**, you reject the below changes to enable the expedited proposals during the next upgrade.\n\n## Background\nThis is a proposal to introduce changes to the governance module and allow any future proposal to be expedited similar to the method of  Prop 225 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/225 ⚠️ . This will give Osmosis governance built-in flexibility to act quickly in the case of emergencies.\n\n## Details\nWith this feature enabled, a proposer can flag any proposal as Expedited when putting it on-chain.\n\nIf expedited, the deposit to enter voting period will be increased to 5000 OSMO. The proposal will have 24 hours to achieve a two-thirds majority of all staked OSMO voting power voting YES.\n\nIf it achieves that two-thirds majority within that time, it will be considered to have passed.\n\nIf it does not achieve the two-thirds majority within 24 hours, it will be converted to a normal proposal and run for the rest of the normal proposal period under normal rules. (If it is vetoed, even after having been converted to a normal proposal, the proposer will still lose the entire 5000 OSMO deposit.)\n\n## Implementation\nThese changes will be effected by implementing the two Github repositories linked here. \n\n1) The original feature and spec can be found  here https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/240.\n\n2 ⚠️ ) Based on the feedback from Commonwealth, the functionality for configuring a separate, higher deposit  has been added https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/254 ⚠️ . 5,000 OSMO (as above) will be the initial parameter.\n\n## Potential Parameter Changes for Future Governance \nThe enlarged proposal deposit can of course be changed by a DAO vote. Likewise, further safety guards can and should be discussed in future threads and proposals. \n\nThese heightened safety guards might include requiring more than a two-thirds threshold to approve an emergency proposal, or they might require an additional delay, such as a longer-than-24-hour voting period for less acute emergencies. Further, governance could add a built-in implementation delay, during which voters could change their votes as the emergency evolved or as new information and perspectives came to light, particularly if it became apparent that the expedited proposal had been subject to a governance attack.\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5035-governance-module-upgrade-twothirds-majority-emergency-voting-periods-24hr ⚠️

This proposal would provide initial incentives on the 31st of July by actioning the following:\n* Directly allocating 0.5% of incentives to go to OSMO/DOT (#773)\n* Set Minimum incentives for the OSMO/DOT (#773) pool of 0.5% to retain this level of liquidity incentives in future\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:**[https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/5271-onboarding-of-new-major-token-pool-osmodot](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/5271-onboarding-of-new-major-token-pool-osmodot)",0,title_and_description

Osmosis v11 Upgrade

👍 99.44%, 👎 0%, 🕊️ 0.54%, ❌ 0% \n
## Osmosis v11 Upgrade\nThis is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v11.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height **5432450**, which is estimated to occur on **Wednesday August 3rd, UTC 16:00**. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.\n\n## Upgrade Features\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n\n### Minimum fee for messages\nImplements the ability for messages to be assigned a minimum fee, without which the transaction will fail.\nThis minimum fee is initially implemented on:\n* CreateGauge - 50 OSMO\n* AddToGauge  - 25 OSMO\n\n### Governance proposal submission deposit\nSubmitting a governance proposal now requires a percentage of the deposit to be filled by the proposing wallet.\nThis is set with the governance parameter min_initial_deposit_percent and is initially implemented as 25%.\n\n## Getting Prepared for the Upgrade\nAs always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.\nIf using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v11/bin/.\nIf not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v11.0.0 binary.\n\n## Details of Upgrade Time\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be **5432450**, anticipated to be on **Wednesday August 3rd, UTC 16:00**. This uses an average block time of 6.2043 ⚠️  seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown  here **https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/5432450**\nThe ⚠️  upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.

Increase Deposit for Proposals to 1600 OSMO

* Voting YES for this proposal will adjust the deposit required for a proposal to enter the voting period to 1600 OSMO.

* Voting NO for this proposal will keep the deposit required for a proposal to enter the voting period at 500 OSMO.

**Details**
The current deposit for a governance proposal is 500 OSMO, worth approximately $500 in the current market.
This was last adjusted in  Proposal 16 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/16 ⚠️  to align with the value of the deposit to propose on the Cosmos Hub. At the time this had a market value of $860.
1600 OSMO has a current market value of approximately $1650 and represents a more significant penalty to discourage spam proposals such as  Proposal 277 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/277 ⚠️ .

Deposits may be filled by more than one party using the command line or wallet interfaces, such as  Commonwealth https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposals ⚠️  and  ping.pub ⚠️  https://ping.pub ⚠️ /osmosis/gov, to ensure that the community is not priced out of governance.

Governance participants should regularly re-evaluate this parameter against OSMO price to ensure it is an appropriate spam deterrent whilst also being accessible. 

 At the current 25% deposit requirement for submission, a new proposal would also require a deposit of 400 OSMO to be filled to be posted to chain initially.

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5 ⚠️ %) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

Website:  https://ion.wtf ⚠️   
Commonwealth Thread:  https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4956-proposal-put-ion-dao-contracts-on-chain-on-osmosis ⚠️ 

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js ⚠️  (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ⚠️  ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ⚠️  ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%

On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

Signaling Proposal for ATOM/stATOM (#803) Incentivised Pool
Voting Start: Wed, 14 Sep 2022 02:51:30 UTC

- By voting **YES** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO matched incentives to the ATOM/stATOM (#803) pool on Osmosis.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO matched incentives to the ATOM/stATOM (#803) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to give matched OSMO incentives to ATOM/stATOM (#803). This pool falls into the “other” incentive category, which gets 2% of OSMO incentives. So the ATOM/stATOM pool would get part of that 2% of OSMO incentives.

The pool is externally incentivized with 375,000 STRD over 45 days. Matched incentives expire when current external incentives end. At that point, Stride will likely submit a new proposal for the stATOM/ATOM pool to be added to the set of pools that receive regular incentives.

After this signaling proposal has passed governance, this pool will begin the onboarding process.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations for a number of coming Osmosis applications, the most prominent of which being Mars Protocol.

Osmosis v12 Oxygen Upgrade

👍 97.64%, 👎 0%, 🕊️ 2.35%, ❌ 0% \n
## Osmosis v12 Oxygen Upgrade\n\nThis is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v12.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 6246000, which is estimated to occur on **Friday September 30th, UTC 16:00**. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.\n\n## Upgrade Features\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n\n### TWAP\n\n* Time weighted average prices for all AMM pools have been implemented. \n* These expose an on-chain oracle for each pool allowing CosmWasm apps to use this data.\n\n### CosmWasm contract developer features\n\n* Enables select queries for cosmwasm contracts.\n* Adds message responses to gamm messages, to remove the neccessity of bindings.\n* Allow specifying denom metadata from tokenfactory.\n* Upgrade to wasmd v0.28.0\n\n### Interchain Accounts Enabled\n\nAllows accounts on another ICA enabled chain to carry out transactions on Osmosis and vice versa.\n\n### Expedited Proposals\n\nAllows governance to have proposals that execute in faster time windows given higher quorums (2/3rds).\n\n Full Change Log https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/v12.x/CHANGELOG.md\n\n## ⚠️  Getting Prepared for the Upgrade\n\nAs always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.\n\nIf using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v12/bin/.\n\nIf not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v12.0.0 binary.\n\n\n## Details of Upgrade Time\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be **6246000**, anticipated to be on **Friday September 30th, UTC 16:00**. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown  here https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/6246000.\n\nThe ⚠️  upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.

Signaling Proposal for STRD/OSMO (#806) Incentivised Pool

- By voting **YES** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their support for adding STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to add STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the STRD/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.

STRD/OSMO (#806) is currently incentivized with a significant amount of OSMO, which was added externally by the Stride Foundation. However, liquidity depth remains low. In the coming weeks, a large STRD airdrop will be released, including 1MM STRD to OSMO stakers. It is desirable for liquidity depth to increase to facilitate the expected uptick in trading volume.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations for a number of coming Osmosis applications, the most prominent of which being Mars Protocol. Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis. It makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the STRD pool to the set of incentivized pools.

In the coming weeks, a large STRD airdrop will be released, including 1MM STRD to OSMO stakers. It is desirable for liquidity depth to increase to facilitate the expected uptick in trading volume.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations for a number of coming Osmosis applications, the most prominent of which being Mars Protocol. Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis. It makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the STRD pool to the set of incentivized pools.

"Signaling Proposal for STRD/OSMO (#806) Incentivised Pool

- By voting **YES** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their support for adding STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to add STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the STRD/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.

This mechanism allows only 2,000,000 net ROWAN to be sold every 24 hours, therefore increasing the stability of the ROWAN price on Sifchain.

# Signalling Proposal for LIKE/OSMO External Incentive Match


This is a proposal to match external incentives for Pool 553 - OSMO/ LIKE. This pool is currently externally incentivized with 15,000,000 LIKE for 176 days.

The broader LikeCoin members have recently  passed a community pool spend proposal https://www.mintscan.io/likecoin/proposals/57 ⚠️  to renew pool incentives on Osmosis, focusing on the LIKE incentivize for Pool 553 - LIKE/OSMO pair. This will re-concentrate resources and deepen the liquidity from other LIKE pools to the OSMO pair.

## What is LIKE?

"# Signalling Proposal for LIKE/OSMO External Incentive Match


This is a proposal to match external incentives for Pool 553 - OSMO/ LIKE. This pool is currently externally incentivized with 15,000,000 LIKE for 176 days.

The broader LikeCoin members have recently [passed a community pool spend proposal](https://www.mintscan.io/likecoin/proposals/57) to renew pool incentives on Osmosis, focusing on the LIKE incentivize for Pool 553 - LIKE/OSMO pair. This will re-concentrate resources and deepen the liquidity from other LIKE pools to the OSMO pair.

## What is LIKE?

LikeCoin decentralizes publishing by allowing everyone to publish and store content in NFTs and easy access to decentralizes storage solutions. LikeCoin is an application-specific chain that serves content lovers, writers, media, and journalists to ensure content integrity and preservation. Actively bringing new audiences and use cases to Cosmos. LikeCoin currently consists of 90k+ cosmos addresses, 29k+ creators and 2mil+ registered content.

- LIKE as a token to [register metadata](https://iscn.io/) to the LikeCoin chain, store content on IPFS & Arweave with the [LikeCoin WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/likecoin/), API, and web portal. It can also be used to mint [Writing NFT](http://liker.land/) in a recent beta product launch.
- LIKE is also a reward token available for sites to monetize their content. (over [9k sites](https://about.like.co/) installed the reward button)
- LikeCoin provides publishing infrastructure to serve media, blogs, and creative sites, to bridge the existing publishing ecosystem to Web3.
- LikeCoin tech stack has been proven in recent years of HackAtom events and is one of [Cosmos's most active GitHub accounts](https://hub.mintscan.io/chain/activity).

Implement A Minimum Gas Price of 0.0025 uOSMO on Osmosis

Voting End: Wed, 09 Nov 2022 22:00:58 UTC
👍 99.64%, 👎 0.28%, 🕊️ 0.04%, ❌ 0.01% \n
Vote YES on this proposal to signal that you support implementation of a minimum gas price of 0.0025 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  uOSMO on Osmosis at the protocol level.\n\nVote NO on this proposal to signal that you do not support implementation of a minimum gas price of 0.0025 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  uOSMO on Osmosis at the protocol level.\n\n**Details**\nCurrently, Osmosis has no protocol-level minimum gas price. The reasoning for this is that the vast majority of OSMO liquidity is on Osmosis, making it difficult for new users to acquire elsewhere to carry out their first transaction. Allowing Osmosis users to submit transactions with a transaction fee of 0 has made it extremely easy for new users to onboard into Osmosis by enabling them to transact on Osmosis for the first time without having the native gas token. \n\nAt the same time, however, setting a minimum gas price of 0 leaves Osmosis vulnerable to denial of service attacks executed via the spamming of free transactions on the network. While thankfully Osmosis has not experienced a major DoS or DDoS event to date, incidences of recurring transaction spam have been increasing.\n\nWith a recent upgrade, Keplr now offers Osmosis users the ability to pay transaction fees on Osmosis in non-OSMO assets (for example, gas can now be paid in ATOM). While the ability to do this has existed on the Osmosis chain for quite some time, this wallet upgrade has opened the door to a large number of onboarding routes into Osmosis for all users on the main front-end for the very first time. Similarly, Osmosis’s Binance listing has made it much easier for new users to purchase OSMO off-chain to use as a transaction fee if necessary.\n\nAs such, the time is ripe to implement a minimum transaction fee on Osmosis. The purpose of this proposal is to signal to Osmosis Labs and other key Osmosis development contributors that governance mandates a minimum gas price of 0.0025 ⚠️  ⚠️  ⚠️  uOSMO be implemented at the protocol level. There is currently no governance adjustable parameter to implement this fee, so this proposal will be implemented in a subsequent software upgrade.\n\nFurther, to the extent that fees need to be priced via the Transaction Fee Module in another asset, the transaction fee module should be amended to utilize Osmosis Time Weighted Average Pricing over at least a 24 hour period instead of the currently utilized spot pricing to ensure that validators are fairly compensated no matter which asset is used for fees\n\nFull discussion on this proposal can be found here:  https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level ⚠️

By voting **YES**, OSMO stakers signal their support for a 12 month renewal of the Osmosis Grants Program with Reverie continuing as Grants Lead.

By voting **NO**, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for a 12 month renewal of the Osmosis Grants Program.

The Osmosis Grants Program (OGP) has been active for 6 months, and is now looking to renew for an additional 12 months with some changes to the program. The details are outlined below.

**Details**

- The OGP will continue its core objective of issuing grants to contributors that can deliver long-term value to Osmosis.

- The OGP will add to this objective the incubation of new subDAOs and Strategic Initiatives to tackle protocol functions.

- Reverie will continue to serve as Grants Lead and is requesting 55,000 USDC and 25,000 OSMO per month in renewed compensation.

- Reverie will add more transparency through monthly reporting, calls, and other frequent reports.

- Jeremy Parish and Monetsupply will be added as two new signers on the OGP multi-sig.

As part of this proposal, the community will have an option to terminate Reverie’s involvement with the OGP after 6 months.

* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates approval that a further 21% of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives should be redirected to the community pool to lower direct Osmosis inflation until governance returns it.\n\n* Voting No for this proposal indicates that 29% shall continue to be the proportion of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives that are redirected to the community pool.\n\n## Background\nOsmosis emits a fixed amount of OSMO per day as inflation, which decreases with each thirdening event. \n45% of this inflation is allocated to Liquidity Incentives and 71% of that is distributed between liquidity providers according to the incentives system resulting in a current emission of 174,978 OSMO per day to pay for liquidity.\nThe remaining 29% is redirected to the community pool to be used for future liquidity incentives when emissions have decreased and the broader market supports higher inflationary APR as a method of attracting new liquidity providers.\n\n## State of Token Liquidity Growth\nOsmosis has seen a steady growth of token liquidity over the last 6 months, particularly in the OSMO/Major and OSMO/Stable pools that receive the majority of liquidity incentive allocations.\n\nAs was observed in [Proposal 268](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/268), liquidity pools tend to grow when the incentives provided are greater than that of independently staking the two halves of the pool, plus a small additional yield that compensates for Impermanent Loss.\nNotable examples of this include:\n* Evmos [where the liquidity drastically increased after external incentives (22nd July) helped compensate for the higher Evmos Staking APR](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/f1c3a9f2-4678-48cf-92a4-8630b60f812e.1668440485580)\n* Juno [where liquidity stagnated until 24th October when the Juno Halvening made Liquidity Provision a better choice again](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/694ebc77-5ba9-4868-81f2-dfa967d1cfde.1668440516112)\n\nFor completeness, other major pools over the last six months include:\n* [WBTC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bd34d3de-1ad0-4fbb-b07d-063ecc9c5bf6.1667579137376)\n* [WETH](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/9560938f-bb15-49de-90e1-06b5e750c29a.1667579147574)\n* [CRO](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/d4bd737e-8b30-4db7-af30-6cbc6e4b1469.1667579157107)\n* [DOT](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0a2d7495-c5d1-41d7-9fdd-41be3e6b73cc.1667579166070)\nThese all have steadily increased whilst being allocated high incentives.\n\nStables seem to act differently, potentially as during the current bear market they may be seen to have poor potential. Liquidity has been relatively stable despite even higher APRs than more volatile assets.\n* [USDC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/020d210a-a6cc-4fb7-a913-5d8dfcdee0b5.1667579081646)\n* [DAI](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/94508d2e-2843-4cc1-8dff-70e3b63c1d1a.1667579097207)\n* [EEUR](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0cdadc1f-b809-461d-bd3b-a18de0098ce8.1667579109574)\n\nCurrently, the state of the top 95% of OSMO paired Liquidity pools based on the reward for Liquidity provision vs the Staking reward (or Osmosis Staking if no alternative) is as below:\n[Liquidity Reward vs Staking Equivalent](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1d1ed978-9eaa-4c61-8a28-c5b8de42c8ce.1668435510417)\n\n## Proposed Reduction\nThis proposal asks that a further 21% of Liquidity Incentives be redirected to the Community Pool at a rate of 7% a week, a change of 29% to 50%. This is an effective 30% reduction in current liquidity emissions.\n\nWhile Osmosis' contribution to a pool's APR from Liquidity Incentives is reduced, APR gained from Swap Fees, External Incentives and Superfluid Staking will be unaffected. This results in smaller APR changes in pools with already lower APR as follows:\n[APR Changes](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ea42ca02-ff4a-46e1-8a96-be95ed64c55f.1668435674138)\nJackal, stOSMO and Tori are cut off but have no changes as they are unincentivised by Osmosis at the time of writing.\n\nThis results in the following change to the Liquidity vs Staking chart, showing where pools are currently trending towards and where they would be trending towards after this reduction completes:\n[Current Trending vs Trending after Reduction](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a9ce040b-047f-45dd-abed-fd951cb66202.1668435703320)\n\nThis shows that even with this reduction, LP rewards will remain superior to alternative token uses whilst reducing the amount that Osmosis pays each day to continue to maintain and grow token liquidity.\n\nIn order to ensure this reduction goes smoothly, an informal group will be formed to oversee each step change. This group consists of\n* Chaos Labs (Incentives Optimisation Infrastructure)\n* Flipside Flan (Flipside)\n* Hathor Nodes (Validator & Incentives Optimisation Researcher)\n* Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Labs)\n* RedRabbit (Osmosis Community)\n\nBy a majority consensus, governance entrusts the five (5) member working group to use their best judgement to delay or halt the implementation of the second and or third 7% weekly redirection in order to ensure that this reduction in incentives does not negatively impact token liquidity. The working group DOES NOT have the ability to revert any redirections that have occurred or change the amount that is to be redirected so that it does not equal the 7% defined in this proposal. The working group will communicate to governance on Commonwealth on a weekly basis whether to expect the second and or third weekly redirection to be postponed due to any yet unforeseen extenuating circumstances.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7501-further-reduction-of-lp-emissions](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7501-further-reduction-of-lp-emissions)",0,title_and_description

Signaling Proposal for stOSMO/OSMO (#833) Incentivised Pool

- By voting **YES** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their support for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to add stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the stOSMO/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.

stOSMO/OSMO (#833) is currently incentivized with STRD from the Stride Foundation, at a rate of 10,000 STRD per day. The Stride Foundation will continue incentivizing this pool for the foreseeable future.

If approved, OSMO incentives to the stOSMO pool would increase liquidity depth, allowing the pool to function as a stable oracle for the price of stOSMO and absorb stOSMO liquidations. If liquidity is deep enough, stOSMO will likely be a collateral option for these coming Osmosis applications: Mars, Membrane, Margined, and Levana. In addition, many applications throughout the Cosmos will likely use stOSMO as collateral - if the stOSMO pool is deep enough.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride has a huge emphasis on security, with a minimalist blockchain, rate limiting, and continual auditing. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations. As Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis, it makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the stOSMO pool to the set of incentivized pools.
