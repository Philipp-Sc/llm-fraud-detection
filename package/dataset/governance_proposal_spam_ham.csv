2,"Upgrade Terra Classic To Re-enable IBC

This signaling proposal will set the course of a software upgrade that is needed on Terra Classic (Columbus-5), hereinafter called “legacy Terra”, to re-enable IBC functionality to Osmosis and Juno.

The IBC channels 1, 20, and 49 (corresponding to Osmosis, Juno, and Crescent, respectively) were set to be “CLOSED” state as part of the v0.5.20 upgrade of Terra core software (https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core/compare/v0.5.19...v0.5.20#diff-0f1d2976054440336a576d47a44a37b80cdf6701dd9113012bce0e3c425819b7L585-R615). In order for these channels to be re-enabled, their states need to be set to “OPEN” via a similar software upgrade.

- By voting YES on this proposal, delegators and validators signal that they are in favor of upgrading the legacy Terra chain to re-enable the previously closed IBC channels `channel-1` (osmosis), `channel-20` (juno) and `channel-49` (crescent)
- By voting NO on this proposal, delegators and validators signal their dissent about upgrading the legacy Terra chain for above stated reasons, or are against the way this proposal has been put up.

Why we use TerraV2 governance: the current state TerraV1 governance is in is debatable. This is a way of consulting the “new” Terra community, which was formed from two snapshots, and represents the stakeholders of the legacy Terra chain in an agreeable way.

If this proposal passes, the next step will be to prepare the software upgrade and propose it on legacy Terra, where legacy delegators and validators can have a final agreement.",0
3,"Reducing the Impact of Volume Manipulation

Voting YES for this proposal indicates acceptance of measures to restrict volume manipulation on Osmosis as well as the use of the linked new Master Incentive sheet. \n\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that volume manipulation should not be restricted by Osmosis governance and/or disapproval of the new linked Master incentive sheet. \n\n Background \n\n Osmosis determines how much it it spends on a pool's incentives based on the swap fees generated in order to encourage liquidity to the most useful pool. \n Wash Trading is the practice of swapping tokens within a pool for the sole purpose of artificially increasing the volume traded within that pool. \n Wash Trading is therefore a dishonest way of increasing the incentives allocated to a pool which does not need additional liquidity to cater for genuine traders. \n\n Proposal \n\n This proposal has 3 linked parts. \n\n 1. Agreement that Wash Trading will be penalised by Osmosis Governance in forms such as, but not limited to: \n - Early completion of the onboarding period to limit the effectiveness of any wash trading \n - Manual fixing of a pool's incentives to be in line with its TVL \n - Full removal of incentives from a pool. \n\n 2. Reduction in the effectiveness of Wash Trading by limiting the Swap Fee used in the subsidy model to 3x the average swap fee across Osmosis \n - This limits the APRs caused by irregular trading whilst also still maintaining high APRs in genuinely popular pools. \n\n 3. Adoption of a new Incentive Master sheet with an improved layout \n - No changes to how incentives are calculated beyond the addition of the swap fee cap in Column Y \n - Overview page to see at a glance APR changes \n - Layout change of Calculations with notes to help better explain why changes are happening. \n - External incentives now pulled in from chain data \n - Maturity based on a start date of incentives rather than manual adjustment \n\n Proposed Spreadsheet is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1el4vImD9KqerdiUBbjG2tz_84Sx7XIxy2Lpg6HC5qrU \n\n Commonwealth Discussion here: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3758-handling-incentive-allocation-on-smaller-pools",0
4,"Composability Incentives Category

This proposal would add Osmosis Liquidity Incentives to pools essential for bridging composability on Osmosis. \n\n## Category Details\nThe composability category is intended to provide small, fixed incentives to stableswap pools between identical assets with differing sources in order to facilitate trading on Osmosis through the deeper canonical asset pools, regardless of the origin of these assets. \n\nAs a category that operates in the background, pools added to this category will not be expected to be added to the main [Osmosis.zone](http://Osmosis.zone) frontend. \n\n## Initial Pools\nInitial pools included in this category would be: \n* [USDC.axl/USDC.grv](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/872)\n* [USDT.axl/USDC.grv](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/873)\n* [USDC.axl/polygon.USDC.axl/avalanche.USDC.axl](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/938)\n\n## Establishing Targets\nBased on typical trading volumes in the current USDC.grv/OSMO and USDT.grv/OSMO pools [require approximately](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/osmosis/incentives-optimization) $95k and $130k of liquidity respectively to facilitate trading to and from Gravity Bridge. As the intended composability pools are StableSwaps they are far more efficient than Balancer pools at providing the same function and so require approximately 3x less liquidity to facilitate trades at the same slippage. \n\nConversely, with the lower levels of swap fees in these pools a much lower slippage should also be targeted. Converting the 0.2% swap fees to 0.04% results in a proportional target of 0.2% slippage. \n\nWe can therefore target specific liquidity for slippage levels. This is calculated in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UcfBmnf8ZKOWBaqOim5yx2kTDWmE5Vy00NwqnbShPzU/edit#gid=0) and results in $45k of liquidity in a pair being required to cater for OSMO/USDC.grv trades and $62k to cater for OSMO/USDT.grv trades if they were StableSwap pools. This may be excessive as the APR from external Gravity incentives provided in [Proposal 347](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/347) makes these pools attractive and there will be activity from people wanting to join for the rewards rather than using them as a way to utilise Gravity Bridge. A baseline of $45k liquidity from incentives alone will therefore be established. \n\nNow the target Liquidity is established we need to identify an attractive APR for this liquidity level. Comparing alternative stable/stable pools across the Interchain shows that typical yields range from 12% to 28% APR. As additional fees will be generated from swap fees, 12% will be set as a reasonable baseline reward rate. \n\n## Rent vs Buy\nAs the total OSMO spend on incentives is relatively small at the intended liquidity targets, acquiring this liquidity through incentives in the more cost-effective option for approximately 5.5 years before purchasing the liquidity outright became a preferable option. As cross-chain bridging routes are still being established and may be subject to change with the release of native USDC on the Interchain, renting through incentivisation is also the more flexible option. \n\n## Requested Incentives\nBringing these together, to establish $45k liquidity earning 12% APR OSMO rewards requires a target of ~15 OSMO a day, which is a minimum incentive setting of 0.0062% per pool, resulting in around 0.02% of actual emissions going to each pool. \n\nThe USDC 3pool requires 1.5 the liquidity and spend of a pair and so needs an emission setting of 0.0093%, resulting in around 0.03% of actual emissions going to this pool. \n\nThis proposal asks that this be set as a fixed level of incentives for every pool added to the composability category to provide functional liquidity for bridge composability. These incentive levels would be set after this proposal and remain in place unless revised by a future governance proposal. \n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10057-composability-incentives-category](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10057-composability-incentives-category)",0
5,"Proposal on Transferring ION to ION DAO Treasury

## Description

- By voting YES on this proposal, 5,468 ION(33% from the Osmosis Community Pool) will be transferred to the ION DAO Treasury.
- By voting NO on this proposal, 5,468 ION(33% from the Osmosis Community Pool) will NOT be transferred to the ION DAO Treasury.

## Details

Proposal Type: Proposal to spend funds from the community pool

A total of 16,572 $ION (78% of the total $ION supply) has been approved to be eventually transferred from the Community Pool to the ION DAO Treasury with the passing of the signaling proposal (#120). To ensure the safety of $ION, we suggest first transferring 33% (5,468 $ION) of the approved amount before systematically transferring the rest after this spend contract is proven safe and reliable.

**Proposal Details**

Match external incentives provided by Carbon for [SWTH/OSMO (#651)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/651). External incentives will begin on 23 March 2022 and will continue for 70 epochs.

- By voting YES on this proposal, external SWTH incentives will be matched at 1,578 USD per day.
- By voting NO on this proposal, external SWTH incentives will NOT be matched at 1,578 USD per day.

**Context**

The Carbon team has provided external incentives amounting to 6,000,000 SWTH for the [SWTH/OSMO pool (#651)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/651) over the course of 70 epochs, beginning on 23 March 2022, which is valued at approximately 110,520 USD in total, at the current price of 0.01842 USD.

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for 1,578 USD per day.

7,"Remove Incentives from OSMO/ROWAN (#629)

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for removing OSMO incentives from the OSMO/ROWAN pool (#629) on Osmosis.\n\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in removing OSMO incentives from the OSMO/ROWAN pool (#629) on Osmosis.\n\n## Details\nThis is an incentives adjustment proposal to remove all incentives from the Sifchain pool OSMO/ROWAN(#629) upon completion, as well as signalling removal from the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. \nThe current OSMO APR is 69% and the Swap Fee APR is 53% a staggered exit is not planned.\n\n## Justification\nThis proposal argues that ROWAN liquidity should remain entirely on Sifchain to facilitate their experimental tokenomics and so Osmosis should cease renting an alternative site of liquidity.\n\nThe most recent experiment is DEX Liquidity Protection which was implemented in the recent software upgrade on the 30th September. This mechanism allows only 2,000,000 net ROWAN to be sold every 24 hours, therefore increasing the stability of the ROWAN price on Sifchain. This cap was immediately hit and has led to a 4x price discrepancy between ROWAN on Sifchain and that transferred off.\n\nThis cap has effectively prevented a normal user from selling their ROWAN on Sifchain as the sale allowance per block is consumed by bots attempting to normalise the on and off-chain prices. If a user wishes to remove liquidity they must accept the loss regardless by exiting through other exchanges such as Osmosis.\nConversely, a user entering ROWAN may purchase on Osmosis and move to Sifchain where they make a theoretical instant 4x profit that is un-redeemable at that value.\n\nThis results in almost all volume passing through Osmosis. Continued incentivisation in the face of this increased volume as users accept their losses or chase an un-redeemable gain will cause a greater and greater share of Osmosis Liquidity Incentives to be allocated to the pool, the liquidity to increase further, and any ROWAN token disparity require more days of arbitrage sales to rectify.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:**[https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/7222-remove-incentives-from-osmorowan-629](https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/7222-remove-incentives-from-osmorowan-629)",0
8,"OSMO/WYND Token Swap for Protocol Liquidity

This proposal requests a spend of 52,000 OSMO from the Osmosis Community Pool to establish Protocol Liquidity of WYND/OSMO within both community pools.

## Details
This proposal is the mirror of the proposal on [WYND DAO](https://app.wynddao.com/vote/B82) to request 170,000 WYND. If only one proposal passes then the community spend shall be returned to the corresponding community pool.

If both proposals pass, 26,000 OSMO would be directly swapped for 85,000 WYND from WYND DAO. This is an approximate value of $25,000 of each token.

These funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig composed of:
* Claimens (CryptoCrew Validator)
* Jasbanza (Osmosis Support Lab)
* Luisqa (Zenith Station Validator)

Each will then add liquidity to the pools on their respective exchanges.

The pools with protocol-owned liquidity will be:
* [WYND/OSMO pool on Osmosis](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/902)
* [WYND/OSMO pool on WYND DEX](https://dex.wynddao.com/pools/juno1s00g9axpxgmwcrlc6xqcxzcjmaqpxhftkx62xfh64xends8ls5dqyyjnnl)

This liquidity will NOT be bonded on either DEX and so will not impact incentives to Liquidity Providers who are bonded.

Any excess tokens that are unable to be provided as liquidity due to a price ratio change between this proposal going on-chain and liquidity being added will be returned to the original owner.

For Osmosis, the GAMM tokens representing this liquidity shall be returned to the Osmosis Community Pool, these may not be sold or deconstructed for a minimum of 1 year, and a governance proposal will be required to remove or modify the LP position in any way.

For WYND, this liquidity shall not be sold or removed from the liquidity pool for a minimum of 1 year and is owned by the WYND DAO, and a governance proposal will be required to remove or modify the LP position in any way.

In total, if passed, liquidity will be provided evenly across the WYND/OSMO pair on both Osmosis and WYND DEX for a minimum of 1 year.

## About WYND
WYND DAO is an innovative, multi-protocol DAO that harvests the best of DeFi to fund positive real-world environmental impact. WYND DAO will deploy multichain DeFi protocols by using advanced CosmWasm contracts.
Twenty-five percent of the fees generated with these protocols will go to an Environmental DAO investing in projects spearheading actions to improve the environment. Delegating WYND tokens will give you a voice in the future of this unique Cosmos project. Osmosis Stakers were among those able to claim the airdrop before the WYND DAO launch and so there is significant crossover between WYND and Osmosis community members.

9,"Signaling Proposal - Define New Stable Asset: IST and incentivize stable swap pool DAI / CMST / IST with OSMO rewards

## Signaling Proposal - Define New Stable Asset: IST and incentivize stable swap pool DAI / CMST / IST with OSMO rewards

## Part 1: Recognize IST as a Stable asset, a Stabletoken
This proposal would recognize IST as a Stabletoken asset on Osmosis.

### Details
Stablecoins backed by fiat assets are under regulatory scrutiny.  There are stable assets that are still pegged to fiat currencies, but are backed by on-chain cryptocurrencies instead of off-chain regulated fiat assets.
Throughout this proposal the distinction between the two are defined as:  

**Stablecoin** - (1) A cryptocurrency designed to maintain parity with another asset, usually an off-chain asset or fiat currency, such as US Dollar.  (2) Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value, unlike most other cryptocurrencies which are known for their volatility. This is achieved by pegging the value of the stablecoin to a stable asset, such as the US dollar. This makes stablecoins useful for transactions and payments, as they provide the benefits of cryptocurrencies (such as fast, secure, and borderless transactions) without the volatility that can make other cryptocurrencies difficult to use as a reliable store of value.

**Stabletoken** - A class of stablecoins that are backed with primarily on-chain cryptocurrency assets rather than off-chain assets.

The use of Stabletoken is encouraged to differentiate between stable currencies that are backed by off-chain regulated  assets vs on-chain assets.

Proposal 233 defined Stablecoins (and therefore the class Stabletokens)  as an asset type to be used in the incentive category structure. Assets defined as Stablecoins/Stabletokens are currently eligible for:

Access to the Osmo/Stable Category for their incentivized pools
Access to the Stable/Stable Category for their incentivized pools
Automatic matching of External incentives within the Stable/Stable Category as per Proposal 377 

Part 1 of this proposal established IST as a Stablecoin/Stabletoken asset on Osmosis.

### Voting
* By voting YES on this proposal, IST will be recognized on Osmosis as a Stabletoken.
* By voting NO on this proposal, IST's status will remain unchanged

**About IST**  
IST is currently the largest native Cosmos circulating Stabletoken with over $1.8M minted.
It is currently mintable via the Inter Protocol parity stability module from USDC, USDT or DAI and will be mintable later this year from volatile assets, such as ATOM.  Exchanges that list IST include Crescent and Osmosis with more coming online every monthly.  As a native Cosmos Stabletoken, it is not a bridged asset and once minted on the Agoric chain, can be used by any and all of the IBC zones.

Website: https://inter.trade/

## Part 2: Enable OSMO incentive for core StableSwap pool DAI / CMST / IST
Part 2 of this proposal recognzes the StableSwap 3 pool of DAI / CMST / IST as a core StableSwap pool and enables OSMO incentives at the next routine incentives proposal.
This is a signaling proposal to include the StableSwap 4 pool DAI / CMST / IST into the set of pools that receive OSMO liquidity incentives by recognising it as a core StableSwap pool.
After this proposal has passed governance, the pool will be added to the regular incentives program of OSMO and receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool. 
The pool incentivised at this time would be Pool 908 with IST & CMST being native Cosmos stable tokens and DAI & USDC provided via the Axelar bridge and as such are the canonical representations of these on Osmosis according to Proposal 206. 
If the canonical status of one of these assets is changed then incentives would move at the next routine proposal to the pool containing the new canonical assets, with the highest volume and matching the criteria stated in Proposal 377.
Stable pools are incentivised by the model defined in Proposal 377. In brief, incentivised pools receive a subsidy of up to 2 times the value of fees generated in the pool in OSMO, with the total of the Stable/Stable category being capped as 4% of current Liquidity Provider emissions.

### Voting
* By voting YES on this proposal, the Stable Swap 3 pool of DAI / CMST / IST will be added to the regular incentives program of OSMO and receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool. 
* By voting NO on this proposal, the pool will not be incentivized.


**About DAI**  
DAI is a Stablecoin cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain generated by MakerDAO. The current version of DAI in use on Osmosis arrives from Ethereum via the Axelar bridge.

**About CMST**  
Composite - $CMST, a fully collateralized, IBC-enabled stablecoin, is built to bring liquidity to Cosmosassets and power DeFi on Cosmos.

**Proposal details**
Signaling proposal to add OSMO incentives to ATOM:CHEQ liquidity pool (#617).

 - By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to adding OSMO incentives to the ATOM:CHEQ liquidity pool on Osmosis.

**Details**This is a signalling proposal to include the ATOM:CHEQ pair into the set of assets which receive OSMO liquidity incentives, which has been requested by the CHEQ community who are eager to provide liquidity.

The benefit to the Osmosis community from cheqd.io is: The team are experts in digital identity, specifically self-sovereign identity (SSI) where the individual holds their own data, following the ""Hold your own keys"" mantra. In a short span of time, they have established partnerships with some of the largest digital identity and SSI software vendors in the world. They want to bring identity to the IBC stack in a way that preserves user privacy and bring Cosmos to the SSI community.

Currently, there are OSMO incentives as well as CHEQ external incentives on CHEQ:OSMO (pool #602). The CHEQ community has added CHEQ external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ (pool #617) and would request the support of the Osmosis community to add OSMO incentives to pool 617.

12,"Incentive Matching Fee Based and 1:1 Caps

Voting YES for this proposal indicates that matching external incentives will no more than double the standard OSMO incentives for a pool and not be matched more than 1:1 in dollar value.\n\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that external incentives will continue to be over-matched according to the external incentive dollar value provided according the bias established in proposal 128 and only capped by the 30% global cap established in proposal 127. \n\n This proposal asks two questions of Osmosis governance and was combined as they are linked.\n The external incentive program established in Proposal 47 has resulted in huge amounts of external tokens being distributed to Osmosis Liquidity Providers as rewards. However, the recent external incentives for STARS, HUAHUA and CMDX, as well as the proposed external ROWAN incentives in #132, have been substantially higher than previous ones. Matching these has resulted in a large amount of the daily Osmosis incentive distribution being used for matching purposes and has had proportionately reduced the APR across other pools without matching incentives.\n A bias to external incentives has been confirmed in Proposal 128. This is not a simple weighting to provide non-Osmosis incentives 50% of the rewards that Osmosis pools do. Instead the weight of non-OSMO pools is decreased by 50% as well as the weight of OSMO pools being raised by 50%.\n As a result of this, on the next semi-automatic incentives proposal, each  of external incentives on non-OSMO pools will not only be matched by bash.50 in OSMO rewards, but would also result in OSMO pools being matched by .50. (In both instances up to the 30% overall cap coming into effect). \n\n This proposal requests that the maximum match for  in external incentives is  in OSMO. \n\n These external incentives have also generated a lot of hype around high APRs, partially funded by Osmosis matching these high external incentives on new pools. This may have caused price increases of these tokens as liquidity providers seek to buy in to pools with higher APRs. In turn causing the price to further increase and therefore requiring even more OSMO to match the, now higher, dollar value of external incentives.\n In order to ensure that the OSMO spent on matching these external incentives is useful for the ecosystem, this proposal requests that a cap on the dollar value of OSMO used for matching be added based on the fees generated by the pool. Fees generated give an indicator of how actively a pool is used and the value that the additional liquidity attracted by this external matching will bring to Osmosis. This cap would be based on the Subsidy Bias model that is in use for normal incentives, promoting the addition of external incentives on OSMO pools and reducing Osmosis' spend on other pools. I.E.  of fees generated in OSMO pools would allow, currently, 3x the dollar amount of OSMO to be available to meet external matching up to the other caps compared to  of fees in a non-OSMO pool.\n\n In short this limits the bonus OSMO APR provided by the incentive matching program to the non-matched APR. \n\n  Whichever of these caps is hit first would be the maximum dollar amount of OSMO that Osmosis uses to match incentives. \n\n Model based on figures from the Semi-Automatic Incentives Proposal #131: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUST7SUkdr3__HgMqfFxItkmTaXhd1Nmsk-Ji0EASNs \n\n Commonwealth Thread on fee based cap: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3578-proposal-external-incentive-matching-caps-on-asset-pairs \n\n Commonwealth Thread on 1:1 matching: https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposal/discussion/3577-proposal-osmo-bias-on-external-incentives-should-not-overmatch-dollar-value/",0

15,"Re-evaluation of NGM/OSMO Incentives

This proposal asks if Osmosis should cease providing incentives to the NGM/OSMO pool (#463). Passing this proposal will remove OSMO incentives at the next routine incentive proposal. \n\n## Details\nOsmosis Governance recently removed incentives from EEUR in the light of the winddown of the stablecoin by the E-money team: [https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/397](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/397) \n\nNGM/OSMO retained incentives from Osmosis as the [original statement from E-money](https://medium.com/e-money-com/eeur-stablecoin-unwind-cf945820fb3f) indicated that the chain would be pursuing other use cases. \n\nOver the last few weeks, multiple NGM pairings have been created with heavy incentivisation of NGM. \n\nThis is part of a new strategy by the e-Money team to achieve the following goals: \n* Create multiple pools against major tokens to reduce exposure to a single asset (OSMO). \n* Join the pools using Treasury tokens programmatically and in a controlled fashion to not adversely impact prices. \n* Deploy genesis LP allocation of NGM to incentivise participation by 3rd parties. \n\nThis is further detailed in this article: [https://medium.com/e-money-com/unwinding-eeur-issuance-and-boosting-ngm-liquidity-d66489b2a62](https://medium.com/e-money-com/unwinding-eeur-issuance-and-boosting-ngm-liquidity-d66489b2a62) \n\nThe pool has had suitable liquidity for normal trading purposes up to this point and will likely grow further with the addition of these high incentives. The share of OSMO incentives this pool receives will also likely grow as there will be a sustained increase in trading volume from liquidity providers purchasing NGM from the NGM/OSMO pool to join the new pools as well as from the programmatic joining of the pool with single sided NGM to establish the team’s own liquidity. \n\nAs Osmosis governance originally incentivised NGM/OSMO as a governance token of a chain with EEUR as its flagship product the Osmosis incentives should also be re-evaluated in line with this new strategy. \n\nThis proposer believes it is in the best interest of Osmosis to remove incentives from the NGM pool for the moment until these pools settle and a course is confirmed for NGM. \n\nSee the Commonwealth thread for the full discussion. \n\n **Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10132-reevaluation-of-ngmosmo-incentives](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10132-reevaluation-of-ngmosmo-incentives)",0

21,"ProtoRev Revenue Allocation

This proposal indicates that the revenue captured by the ProtoRev module will be allowed to accumulate within a module address until at least the 1st June 2023\nThis time will be used to gather data on the revenue accumulated and discuss ideas on how best to utilise it. After one month of reviewing proposals for recommended options, the community should make a decision on the direction of the ProtoRev account.\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to provide a recommendation around how Osmosis should initially handle the revenue generated by the ProtoRev module.\n\nOnce the ProtoRev module is implemented as part of the v15 upgrade, the community will need to decide how this revenue should be allocated. We recommend that Osmosis wait a minimum of 4 months and let the revenue accrue to a dedicated account controlled by governance. While it should be deployed to the benefit of Osmosis in the future, the community should wait until it has accumulated enough capital to make a material impact whenever it is deployed.\n\n# Background\n\n## ProtoRev Module Design Overview\n\nAs described in the governance forum post about the ProtoRev module, the module will check a set of possible arbitrage routes after every transaction and determine whether a back-running arbitrage opportunity was created by the transaction. The module will then:\n* Determine the most profitable arbitrage opportunity and optimal trade size\n* Leverage the Bank module to flash-loan itself the tokens required to perform the arbitrage trade\n* Conduct the swaps for guaranteed profit\n* Repay the loan by burning the flash-loaned assets\n\nThese transactions will take place after standard user transactions at the end of the block to rebalance the pools and capture the arbitrage profits. The revenue captured by the ProtoRev module will accrue to an account controlled by Osmosis governance. The ProtoRev module will conduct OSMO and ATOM settled arbs initially, so this account will hold a mix of OSMO and ATOM.\n\n## Benefits for Osmosis\n\nThe ProtoRev module is a groundbreaking innovation for AMMs and stands to improve the economic sustainability and UX for Osmosis:\n\n**Economic Sustainability**\nThe ability to capture in-protocol MEV as protocol revenue is one of the largest competitive advantages that Osmosis has over DEX’s built on monolithic chains. These other AMM applications are limited to rent-seeking forms of revenue generation (e.g. Uniswap’s fee switch) because all MEV accrues directly to validators. That’s not to say that Osmosis should not implement a take rate on trading fees, but rather that it’s unlikely to be sustainable as the only form of protocol revenue.\n\nWe have already begun to see compression of DEX fees as evidenced by the introduction of Uniswap’s 5bps and 1bp fee tiers. We have also seen this dynamic play out with traditional exchanges, as Robinhood was able to capture huge amounts of market share from incumbents (e.g. Fidelity, Schwab) by removing trading fees. As more DEXs enter the Cosmos ecosystem, the ability to undercut fees will serve as a strong competitor differentiator for Osmosis. By allowing Osmosis to capture a more sustainable revenue stream in the form of benign MEV, the ProtoRev module greatly improves Osmosis’s positioning as the space becomes more competitive.\n\n**Protocol Health**\nIn addition to capturing protocol revenue that would otherwise be lost to searchers, the ProtoRev module will also improve the UX of Osmosis. Current arbitrage systems run intermittently, allowing price differentials to remain in place for multiple blocks. The ProtoRev module will keep asset prices even across pools for every trade by running cyclical arbitrage at the end of each block to rebalance the pools.\n\n# Revenue Projections\n\nFrom October 1 to December 31st, there has been $176,637.97 extracted from Osmosis liquidity pools in the form of arbitrage transactions. This translates to approximately $1,941 per day. [(Source)](https://satellite.skip.money/)\n\nAs can be seen from the below charts from this period, this extraction varies hugely depending on the market conditions which trigger these transactions during periods of high volatility.\n$30,737 (17.6%) of this MEV was extracted over the two days of October 27th, 2022 to October 28th 2022 (Binance Listing)\n\nThe FTX collapse caused significantly higher volatility and so higher MEV extraction during the second week of November 2022.\n\nDecember 10th 2022 has a spike in price caused by manipulation on Binance due to closed withdrawals/deposits. [(Source)](https://t.ly/llXI)\n\n[USD Captured as MEV on Osmosis 3rd October 2022 - 31st December 2022](https://t.ly/HWk1)\n\n[Price and Volume chart of OSMO in the same period, showing alignment of volatile periods with increase in MEV.](https://t.ly/cvGZ)\n\nDuring a stable bear market, excluding these spikes, we may expect MEV to reach $1,368 per day, of which an estimated 70-80% will be recovered by the ProtoRev module.\n\nFor comparison purposes, during the last bull market, for February 1st 2022 - April 31st 2021, cumulative MEV collected was $1,821,199, or $20,462 per day. This shows that the potential return from the ProtoRev module in arbitrage alone may be a significant part of protocol income in the future. Especially with the addition of links to many more chains since this period than existed on Osmosis at the time, allowing for more opportunities for arbitrage between routes to occur.\n\n# Recommendation\n\nAs the bear market rages on, we want to ensure the MEV revenue generated by the ProtoRev module is utilized in a manner which maximizes its benefits to the Osmosis community. The Osmosis Community Pool at the time of this writing currently holds 63.22M OSMO tokens. This is expected to grow at an accelerated rate as we continue to shift incentives which were previously allocated to incentivizing liquidity pools.\n\nTo this end, MEV revenue should be deployed at times when the contributions can be meaningful in size to the protocol. As discussed, on average we may expect MEV to reach ~$1300 per day which we can expect the ProtoRev module to recover the majority of.\n\nAlthough this creates a positive value accrual mechanism for the Osmosis community, the amounts being generated would not be significant if added to the community pool which currently is receiving 60% of the liquidity incentives. Allowing this revenue to be directed to the community pool would fail to maximize the benefits to the traders, liquidity providers and stakers of Osmosis.\n\nIn the current market conditions, directing this revenue to stakers would not move the needle in terms of value accrual to OSMO. By our estimates, stakers would only see a 0.8% increase in staking yield (e.g. 23.28% to 23.46%) if they were to receive 100% of the ProtoRev module’s revenue. Since Skip will receive 20% of the revenue in Year 1 (as part of the [community approved payment schedule](https://t.ly/EG3f), stakers would only see 0.14% added to their APR. While the community should consider this option in the future as the emission schedule winds down, or if MEV revenue increases, there are likely more impactful ways to deploy this capital in the near term.\n\nAs such, we are proposing the revenue generated from MEV is collected, until the funds can grow to have a meaningful impact towards benefiting the community. We believe it is in the best interest of the community to collect the revenue in an account controlled by governance. Over the next four months, community members should submit proposals with their recommendation on how best to deploy these funds. The community can then vote on the potential options to distribute this revenue. We recommend that the community should conduct reviews on a quarterly basis to evaluate the ongoing impact of deployed capital. Based on the results, adjustments can be made as needed to ensure this protocol income is utilized effectively and proportionately.\n\nBelow are some ideas on how we could deploy MEV revenue in the future:\n\n**UX Benefits**\n* Subsidization of swap fees, gas fees, or bridge / on-ramping fees\n\n**Supplementing / Replacing Costs**\n* Supplement LP yield for high priority (e.g. Superfluid Staking) or under-incentivised pools\n* Supplement staking yield\n\n**Other**\n* Funding growth initiatives or loyalty programs\n* Insurance pool\n* Building a stablecoin reserve\n\n# Conclusion\nThis proposal would allow the revenue captured by the ProtoRev module to accumulate within a module address. This will allow the community to assess the amount of typical value captured by the module as well as forming a reserve of capital. Accumulating a larger reserve will enable this capital to have a more meaningful impact when it is ultimately deployed.\n\nThis Revenue Reserve would be assessed no earlier than 1st June 2023. After reviewing proposals for recommended options, the community should make a decision on the direction of the ProtoRev account.\n\n# Additional Note\nWhile all options should be evaluated during the research phase, we believe that the community pool or DAOs with authorised spends are likely more appropriate sources of funding for any use case that would involve discrete, one-off spend. Unlike the community pool, the ProtoRev account address does not need consent from governance for each deployment of assets to every contract authorised by governance to be able to draw on funding. This enables more flexibility to create an approach that optimizes the streaming of funds to maximize impact. This post included a few potential options, but we welcome community members to put forth any ideas with supporting analysis and engage in discussion over the next 4 months.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9615-protorev-revenue-allocation-proposal](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9615-protorev-revenue-allocation-proposal)",0

Build: Jun 22 + Jul 22 (2 months)\n* Build fast and integrate with Juno\n* Introduce and assist other Terra developers\n* Engage with Juno & IBC communities and developers\n\n### 2. Launch - Aug 22 + Sep 22 (2 months)\n* Launch Dex, Aggregator and DeFi NFT Marketplace on Juno\n* Start generating revenue for all products\n* Gather community feedback through customer interviews and surveys\n\n### 3. Grow - Oct 22 + Nov 22 (2 months)\n* Increase user base and revenue with events, marketing, PR and BD, and conduct experiments on the highest ROI activities\n* Iron out bugs and prioritise features development with highest demand based on feedback collected from the community and users\n* Launch Loop Learn on Juno to educate and attract new Juno stakers\n\n### 4. Scale - Dec 22 + Jan 2023 and onwards\n* Launch Eclipse Launchpad to launch new projects on Juno and IDO on Loop Dex\n* Reduce contracted developer headcount once all grant items delivered\n* Scale up marketing and revenue generating activities with highest ROI\n\n## Original Terra Developer Fund Grant - Status\n## \n\n**Original Grant Proposal:**\nhttps://bafybeie5squ5hndbx5pqpmqm3kzg46bsegqlsawukzfxexby5c37loi5xy.ipfs.nftstorage.link/\n\nThe below is a high level summary of progress based on grant deliverables. Detailed update is provided in sections below.\n\n* Loop DEX (250k USD)                                                - Deployed\n* COSMOS DEX Aggregator (150k USD)       - Deployed and under deployment\n* Loop Community (100k USD)                       - Deployed and under development\n* NFT marketplace (300k USD)                       - Deployed and under development\n* Loop Learn (150k USD)                                  - Planned Deployment in Nov 2022\n* Public Launchpad (250k USD)                      - Planned Deployment in Dec 2022\n* Ecosystem Growth(200k USD)                     - Delivered and ongoing\n* Airdrop  to Juno stakers                        - Completed\n* LOOP to Juno Community Fund      - 12M LOOP sent (~336k USD)\n\n**Total 1.4M over 6 months**\n\n**Final tranche payment remaining: 233K**\n\n## Detailed Product Updates\n\nAt Loop we launch MVP products into beta after internal testing. Anyone who has launched software products is aware that this model is widely accepted as the best approach to building the best applications. It allows iterative improvement based on community feedback so that we end up building the best product for the community, rather than the best one we think the community wants.\n\n**Text from this section is incomplete to reduce max character limit for an on-chain vote. Please review the full text which is available in the commonwealth discussion page linked here:** \n\n**https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7655-loop-finance-juno-tdf-final-tranche-payment**\n\n### Loop Chain Long Term Goals & Mesh Security\n### \nLoop\'s long term plan is to eventually launch our own chain. We can foresee a long and happy relationship with Juno, including an airdrop of Loop Chain tokens to Juno stakers, the application of mesh security between Juno and Loop, and many other collaborations, if this proposal goes ahead.\n\nLaunching our own chain would not mean that we would abandon Juno. We would continue to deploy the same products across both chains, connect to protocols on both chains, offer both chains in our mobile wallet, etc. Our long term goal is to be connected to many chains, providing a bridge between multiple ecosystems and protocols.\n\nThe more we can expand the adoption and growth of Loop, the more the Juno community will benefit, as both the Juno Community wallet and Juno members are all LOOP token holders thanks to our airdrop.\n\n### Loop to Open-Source Code\n### \n**Please note:** It is Loop\'s intention to open-source all of our smart contract code in a 3-6 month timeframe, after it has passed rigorous internal testing & 3rd party validation by a well established auditing firm, the results of which will be shared with the community.\n\n## Voting\n\n- Vote YES if you\'d like Loop to receive their final grant tranche as per above.\n- Vote NO if you don\'t want Loop to receive their final grant tranche as per above.\n- Vote ABSTAIN to express no opinion on the matter. \n- Vote NOWITHVETO to cause this proposal to fail if 1/3 of voters also choose veto.  In the event of a veto, depositors\' deposits will be burned.\n",0

At its core, Dig addresses the regulatory roadblocks standing between real estate and the blockchain. Dig will achieve this through a network of jurisdictionally compartmentalized blockchains that fund real estate development in local markets, for example: Dig Vietnam / Dig UK / Dig Belarus. All of these sub-chains will all operate under Dig, each one able to comply with local regulations. Dig shall develop an NFT standard that allows for the fractional ownership of digital or physical items and have a high-touch local team in every relevant market to this end. In short, Dig will comply with local regulations in each country it operates within, allowing it to gradually expand as the regulatory framework of each country develops.\nWebsite: https://digchain.org\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dig_chain\nMedium: https://medium.com/@digchain_official\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/5bEKBFEsq3",0
28,"Phase out 1 and 7 day liquidity bonds

### Summary

By voting YES on this proposal, Osmosis stakers signal their support for the removal of incentives from existing 1 and 7 day liquidity bonds of and stopping the creation of new 1 and 7 day liquidity bonds.
 
### Details
1 and 7 day bonding have seen minimal usage by liquidity providers. Currently, around 1.6% of liquidity uses 1 day bonding and 2.1% uses 7 day bonding according to weighted statistics derived from Dexmos.app.
 
The usage of these distracts from the long-term focus of the Osmosis DEX and with the addition of Concentrated Liquidity strategies in pools, standard AMM liquidity is most suitable for more passive liquidity providers who are willing to bond for longer periods of time. 
 
Previously we at Notional have supported a ""time value of money"" and ""risk pricing"" concept, as can be seen here:
https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3921-time-value-of-money
https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4560-risk-pricing-of-delegations
Both of these past proposals can be seen as encouraging proportionality.

That said, both of the above proposals make users think and choose more. We believe in sane defaults: https://github.com/osolmaz/sane-defaults
In this case, the sane default is 14 days. Aligning 14 day bonding with 14 day staking has the additional benefit of promoting the use of superfluid staking. 

This proposal is designed to come on-chain before
https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/8894-automatic-staking-of-lp-rewards-to-validator-set-preferences so as to inform decision-making on it.

Target on chain date: January 18, 2022


## Implementation
* Users should be able to keep their 1 and 7 day lp positions without modification. 
* After the v15 or v16 upgrade, no new 1 and 7 day lp positions should be creatable.
* Incentives should be removed from 1 and 7 day bonds.

## Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match

### Summary
This is a signaling proposal to re-include the IST pool OSMO/IST (#837) into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. After this proposal has passed governance, pool #837 will once again be added to the regular incentives program of Osmosis. 

### Voting
* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/IST (#837) on Osmosis.
* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/IST (#837) on Osmosis.

### Description
Pool 837 - OSMO/IST is currently incentivized with 450,000 BLD over 90 days from January 9, 2023.
Inter Protocol’s IST token launched on 10/27 with the launch of Agoric’s JavaScript platform. After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST. IST liquidity will be incentivized through the Cosmos ecosystem, with Osmosis being a critical early destination.
The authors believe that it would be in the best interests of the community to incentivize an OSMO-IST pool to drive deep eventual liquidity and easy access from any other Osmosis token.

### What is IST?
IST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric’s unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric’s model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.

For its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST. Each PSM accepts another Cosmos stablecoin and mints IST in exchange. There are currently six PSM contracts running, accepting DAI, USDC and USDT over both Axelar and Gravity bridges, each with different minting limits. Rationale for the current minting limits was explained by the elected governance committee here: https://community.agoric.com/t/ist-minting-limits-for-inter-protocol-mvp-launch/87/1 

Additional PSMs may be added by governance to accept new IBC-accessible stablecoins. 
IST’s next iteration will include overcollateralized vaults, which will drive a major unlock for minting capability and allow the token to diversify away from bridge risk and stablecoin centralization risk.

This is a proposal to fund the proactive approach to security benefiting the Terra community, leveraging the expertise and position of SCV. Continuously helping all projects and software within Terra's ecosystem by:

- proactively identifying risks on Terra’s software stack;
- coordinating vulnerability disclosures and remediations;
- actively monitoring external surface for vulnerabilities;
- providing security awareness, training and guidance.

In a nutshell, at SCV, We combine high end security research with a real world attacker mentality approach to reduce risks, fortifying code and implementations for the entire Terra perimeter and software stack for Terra.

The funding would be required to sponsor vulnerability research, small hackathons and continuously scaling our proactive security work dedicated for Terra and on-chain projects.

The SCV team is asking 550k Lunas or ~ 900k USD worth from the community pool to bootstrap and scale what is described in this proposal. Note that SCV is a registered company and all considerations were based before tax.

45,"Whitelist Apollo Vaults for USDC and ATOM

This proposal whitelists the Apollo Vault addresses for OSMO/ATOM and OSMO/USDC for ForceUnlocking, enabling them to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within.

## What are Vaults?
Vaults are a key piece of infrastructure required to enable leveraged yield farming on Osmosis.

Vaults allow users to deposit tokens to be managed by a protocol and enable access to yield strategies offered by that protocol.

The first such strategy is Apollo's [Leveraged Liquidity Provision](https://articles.apollo.farm/the-future-of-apollo/), launching in conjuction with [Mars Protocol](https://marsprotocol.io/).

Leveraged Liquidity Positions require depositing assets into a vault which then provides liquidity on a user's behalf. These assets may then be used as collateral via Mars' Rover Credit Accounts to increase the value of the liquidity provided. The vault also auto-compounds rewards into the pool to maximise yield.

In the event of the pool's value dropping below a declared safety threshold and the position being liquidated, the collateralised assets within the vault are required to be automatically sold. As these assets will be locked in order to receive liquidity incentives this is not possible without allowing the vault addresses to directly bypass this restriction and unlock assets immediately rather than waiting for the bonding period to pass.

Apollo LP Vaults have been audited by Oak Security and the audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/master/Apollo).

## Implementation
This proposal directly whitelists two addresses to be able to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within them.

These addresses are the deposit addresses for the following vaults:
* OSMO/ATOM (#1) (14 Day Bonding) - osmo1g3kmqpp8608szfp0pdag3r6z85npph7wmccat8lgl3mp407kv73qlj7qwp

51,"Protocol Owned Liquidity proposal on WYND DEX

This proposal is to request 166,000 $JUNO ($250,000) from the community pool to be added with 835,000 $WYND ($250,000) minted by the WYND DAO into the JUNO/WYND pool on WYND DEX as Protocol Owned Liquidity.

You can read more about what is POL and WYND DEX here 

https://dex.wynddao.com/
https://medium.com/wynddao/wynnovation-protocol-owned-liquidity-78fbbadac86f 

## Parameters of this agreement if passed

1. ~$500,000 of liquidity will be added to the WYND/JUNO pool on WYND DEX. 
1. The Juno Community pool and the WYND DAO will each own 50% of provided liquidity. This is not a spend, but rather a reallocation of unutilized $JUNO into a defi protocol.
1. The liquidity may be removed at a future date, and the value of the liquidity at the time of removal will be returned to the Juno Community pool and the WYND DAO at 50/50 distribution. Specifically, at the time of removal from the liquidity pool, all available $JUNO will be sent to the Juno Community Pool and all available $WYND will be sent to the WYND DAO.
1. None of the liquidity will be bondend so it will not impact incentives for regular liquidity providers. If community want to bond these tokens they should open a new governance proposal specific for this.
1. In case the community decides to bond tokens in the future, the incentives earned will be split 50% to Juno Community pool and 50% to WYND DAO.
1. $WYND incentives earned by Juno Community pool will be sent to the Juno Community pool. The Juno Community pool has the full right to determine how these assets are used, including but not limited to selling/swapping, staking for governance rights, providing liquidity, or to use in other defi applications. 
1. Participation in Protocol Owned Liquidity can be withdrawn at any time for any reason by either party.
1. Modification of existing parameters, such as adding, partially removing liquidity, or adding / modifying the bondend amount or duration will also require an on-chain governance vote by both parties.


## Plan of action

Community pool tokens from Juno and WYND DAO will be  sent to a Juno/WYND PoL multi-sig address that will then allocate token to the liquidity pools. This subDAO will also maintain custody of the LP position unless a governance proposal from either Juno or WYND dictates otherwise.

Any excess $WYND goes to the WYND DAO community pool. This means in effect that each side contributes a maximum number of tokens as given in the proposal, but the swap is performed at market price at time of LPing, so the token with better price action will receive some of the tokens back


Multisig members are
- Esse (Made in Block Validator)
- Jakub (WYND Developer)
- Rarma (Community Member)
- CryptoCakir (Stake & Relax Validator)
- Mike Purvis (CronCat co-founder)

## Note

_Protocol Owned Liquidity_ is a novel concept that has yet to be successfully implemented in the Cosmos Ecosystem. If this proposal passes, Juno will be the home of the first ever protocol owned liquidity governed by a DAO. The successful implementation of Protocol Owned Liquidity with the Juno Community pool will pave the way to attract more interchain liquidity to Juno Network and WYND DEX.


**Voting**:

- **YES** - You agree to provide 166,000 $JUNO from the community pool to participate in protocol owned liquidity on WYND DEX
- **NO** - You don’t agree to provide 166,000 $JUNO from the community pool to participate in protocol owned liquidity on WYND DEX
- **ABSTAIN** - You formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal
- **NO WITH VETO** - You would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their 1000 JUNO deposit, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",0

# **TL:DR:**\n BitCanna has released a payment plugin for the Cosmos-ecosystem for WooCommerce and Prestashop.\nIn this plugin JUNO is enabled as payment method, offering a possibility for webshops to start accepting JUNO as a means of payment. Community support is vital in our opinion, which is why we want to ask the approval of the Juno community to have JUNO enabled in the plugin with this proposal.\n* Vote Yes if you are in favor of having JUNO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay\n* Vote No if you don’t want JUNO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay\n\n## Details\n### Who is BitCanna?\nBitCanna has been found by and for the cannabis industry. It aims to provide a secure and efficient way for businesses and consumers to transact using blockchain technology to create a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions, enabling fast and secure payments without the need for intermediaries. The platform also includes a range of tools and services for merchants, such as point-of-sale systems and financial management tools. With BitCanna, the cannabis industry can benefit from the advantages of digital currencies, including low transaction fees, global accessibility, and increased security.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.bitcanna.io](https://www.bitcanna.io)\n\n### What is Cosmos Pay?\nCosmos Pay is an open-source plugin developed by BitCanna for the e-commerce. Currently it is live for the platforms WooCommerce and Prestashop. Keplr is integrated, making the user experience to pay as smooth as possible.\nThe plugin offers the possibility to integrate a lot (if not all) Cosmos-SDK based cryptocurrencies and is therefore an addition to the tools the Cosmos ecosystem already has to offer.

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%

# Fund Incentives for the Interchain NFTs Public Incentivized Testnets of Game of NFTs 

# Summary 

The Game of NFTs (GoN) is an event proposed as a joint effort by multiple Cosmos teams, aiming to test the Interchain NFTs feature and build applications on top of it, which will have 2 phases: a) public incentivized testnets and b) a hackathon. This event is expected to happen in Q1 2023.

This is a community pool spend proposal seeking approval to fund **20000 ATOMs** worth of incentives for the Game of NFTs **Phase 1 - Interchain NFTs incentivized testnets** - to reward participants.

# Background - Interchain NFTs 

The Interchain NFTs technology can facilitate interoperability and expands the capabilities of IBC by allowing cross-chain NFT interoperability between IBC-enabled chains, which is the work of multi-team efforts supported by the Interchain Foundation. 

With collaborative efforts from ICF, IRISnet, Gravity Bridge, Stargaze, Ark Protocol and many community teams, it has Cosmos SDK and CosmWasm implementations that can be easily adopted by Cosmos SDK Chains including Cosmos Hub or CosmWasm Chains to expand their interconnections across the ecosystem. 

In November 2022, the first IBC NFT transfer between two test chains using different implementations of ICS721 was successfully executed on testnets. This marked a significant step forward for the IBC NFT ecosystem demonstrating the NFT interoperability between Cosmos SDK (Go) and CosmWasm (Rust) chains. 

NFTs have now captured the attention of various industries as well as Cosmos stakeholders. Similar to fungible tokens, if NFTs are just tied to one blockchain, the number of transactions and size of the NFT market would be restricted. To remedy this and unleash the next level of Cosmos NFT, high connectivity and interoperability are required. This is where Interchain NFTs enter the picture. We believe that Interchain NFTs and the community collaboration around them are expanding the mindshare and market share for Cosmos. 

More details about Interchain NFTs: [Interchain NFTs are Coming to Cosmos | by Interchain | The Interchain Foundation | Medium 4](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/interchain-nfts-are-coming-to-cosmos-e01e3abe3d37) 

# Game of NFTs 

The Interchain NFTs technology requires rigorous testing with the community involved. To boost the IBC NFT ecosystem, we’re proposing to launch a Game of NFTs event, which will build on the success of previous programs including [Game of Stakes 6](https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes) and [Game of Zones 1](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/), as well as the ongoing [Game of Chains 1](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022). The event is expected to have two phases: 
* Phase 1: Public Incentivized Testnets, for chains and service providers to test around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around February 2023. 
* Phase 2: A Hackathon, for developers to create tools, dApps and use cases around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around March 2023. 

## Public Incentivized Testnets - Phase 1 

Many talented teams are contributing to the IBC NFT ecosystem, and have plans to deploy this Interchain NFTs technology. To facilitate wide adoption and successful deployment to capture more value to the Interchain, Phase 1 of the Game of NFTs event is designed to provide mainnet-like environments for purposes on a) testing the performance and capability of Interchain NFTs feature, and b) building trust in Interchain NFTs and preparing for its deployment in the mainnet environments. 

The Interchain NFTs technology is crucial to facilitate interoperability and use cases of IBC, and will capture more value and use cases for both Cosmos-SDK and Wasm chains in Cosmos. By bringing this proposal up, we believe in the Interchain, Cosmos Hub is always a pioneer that takes the lead to pays attention to innovative technologies and public goods that can enhance IBC, Cosmos SDK and more underlying technologies, which is crucial to Cosmos Hub, Cosmos chains and also the Interchain. We would like to bring more value to the Interchain and there is no better way to do this than by having support from Cosmos Hub to Cosmos teams and communities to join the testing and improve this technology jointly. 

For this reason, we believe it’s crucial to have testnets environment for Cosmos teams and communities to participate, as well well to reward participants who help contribute through the testing to the Interchain, we’re seeking community approval for 20K ATOMs withdrawn for the community pool as incentives for the GoN Phase 1 - Public Incentivized Testnet. 

* 50% (10K ATOM) of the prize pool will be reserved for Phase 1 participants who complete Public Incentivized Testnet tasks with a set point system that is allocated based on their scores. These tasks and the point system will be published at the launch of the testnet. 
* The remaining 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for bonuses to Phase 1 participants who help identify bugs or performance issues or help develop new tools and monitoring solutions at the discretion of the board of judges 
* Funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig committee 
* Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool 

Game of NFTs is a joint effort by the Interchain ecosystem, so certainly, in addition to the support from the Cosmos community pool to advance the infrastructure and underlying technology, there will be various support from Cosmos projects such as IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno and other teams, and also from organizations such as IDG Capital and HashKey Capital. There will be multi-team support from their community pools, to sponsor the prize pool of Phase 2 Hackathon that is boosting applications on top of this infrastructure and technology. 

Through collaborative efforts of the Cosmos teams and community, this whole event will bring out verified Interchain NFTs infrastructure and technology that can be simply used and adopted by Cosmos chains, and prompt the creation of various pioneer applications using the technology, which together will create a complete IBC NFT ecosystem from bottom-up for the Interchain, and quickly expand the mind and market share for Cosmos.

65,"Are Validators Charging 0% Commission Harmful to the Success of the Cosmos Hub?

This governance proposal is intended to act purely as a signalling proposal.  Throughout this history of the Cosmos Hub, there has been much debate about the impact that validators charging 0% commission has on the Cosmos Hub, particularly with respect to the decentralization of the Cosmos Hub and the sustainability for validator operations. 

 Discussion around this topic has taken place in many places including numerous threads on the Cosmos Forum, public Telegram channels, and in-person meetups.  Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. 

 There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission.  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 

 This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum.  It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. 

 We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here:  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 

 Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. 

 The question on this proposal is “Are validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?”.  A Yes vote is stating that they ARE harmful to the network's success, and a No vote is a statement that they are NOT harmful.",0

This proposal was discussed on the cosmos Hub Forum here: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-hub-open-source-funding-policy/8566

We propose the following rules related to all funding decision made by Cosmos Hub funding bodies requesting funds from Community Pool:

Projects receiving funding to deploy chains/consumer chains MUST open source Chain binary code (and any associated smart contracts deployed by the core team receiving funding) prior to mainnet launch.
Wallet projects where users store their private keys and interact with the chain MUST be open source to receive funding.
These requirements exist to protect users. If the conditions for open source compliance are not met, all funding for the project should be immediately halted. Once open source requirements are met, outstanding funding will be provided as previously agreed.

Furthermore these additional rules shall apply to:

Community pool may only fund open source projects
Future grants from community fund treasury may only fund projects where every component is open source.
Moreover, as a chain built entirely on public goods, we emphasize that all Cosmos funding should prioritize projects that are entirely open source.

By voting YES you approve that we should adopt the funding policies described above

By voting NO you disapprove of the proposal

By voting ABSTAIN you ABSTAIN from making a ruling.

By voting NO with VETO you express that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",0
73,"Major Incentives Category Rebalance

* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates that liquidity incentive minimums should be reallocated as below\n\n* Voting No for this proposal indicates that existing liquidity incentive minimums should be unaffected by this proposal\n\nOsmosis Liquidity incentives are distributed daily according to the category model established in Proposal #233 with 45% of the daily incentives going to major/osmo pools. These are distributed according to minimum incentive levels established in Proposals #223, #229 and #233 with the remainder distributed proportional to the fees generated by transactions in these pools as follows:\n* OSMO/ATOM (#1): 25%\n* OSMO/WETH (#704): 4.91%\n* OSMO/WBTC (#712): 5%\nLeaving 10.09% to be awarded based solely on the share of fees. These currently go 0.9% to CRO and the remainder to ATOM.\n\nThis proposal asks that the minimums are redefined to the following in order to further encourage deep liquidity in a variety of Major pools:\n* OSMO/ATOM (#1): 15%\n* OSMO/CRO (#9): 3%\n* OSMO/WETH (#704): 10%\n* OSMO/WBTC (#712): 10%\nLeaving 7% to be awarded based solely on the share of fees.\n\nA maximum incentive level would also be implemented for OSMO/ATOM (#1) of 25% in order to enable these changes. Without this, Pool #1 continues to draw the majority of the fees due to its size and does not allow newer pools to grow. Further maximum incentive settings can be implemented in future proposals to ensure that Osmosis does not incentivise any one asset excessively.\n\nIf passing by the time of the regular incentives proposal, these changes will also be merged into the new incentives proposal for the 29th May so the regular incentives proposal does not revert the gauge weights to the current minimums on passing. The regular incentives proposal should be voted No on if this proposal was passing on the 29th and later fails.\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5034-change-to-minimums-in-major-incentives-category",0

**About Carbon (SWTH)**

Carbon is a protocol that powers cross-chain financial markets and ecosystems. As a custom-purposed blockchain, Carbon is designed specifically to allow trading of sophisticated financial instruments such as options, bonds and futures at scale. Developers can also build any kind of DeFi application on top of Carbon, while enjoying multi-chain interoperability. Carbon is currently integrated across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Zilliqa, Neo, as well as any IBC-compatible chain such as Osmosis, Terra, and Cosmos Hub. Carbon currently powers decentralized, cross-chain order-book trading of spot and futures markets on Demex.

Since the addition of the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis last month, the pool has already garnered over USD 1.72m in liquidity, with a 7D average trading volume of USD 137k.

Via Carbon governance, additional SWTH rewards have been allocated to the OSMO/BUSD spot liquidity pool on Carbon, as well as the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis.

All memes will have a ''Juno Sauce'' watermark.\n- Organize 3 Twitter Spaces per week, with a length of 60 minutes+ each. Titles will always include SAUCE or MEME , and discussion will gravitate to Juno News (but may go off topic sometimes).\n- Any ''FUD'' or drama directed at Juno will instantly be dealt with by the meme army AND we will not hesitate to resort to ''Twitter bots'' to sway engagement in our favour.\n- Will be organizing a monthly Poker Tournament for the Juno community. Any donations for prizes are welcome for this initiative.\n- Hold a monthly JUNO meme competition\n- Hold a JUNO meme class and an educational workshop on how to create memes.\n- Partial coverage of Juno spaces and other Juno news by Rekt News.\n\nIf the communication subDAO is polite and neutral, the Juno Sauce subDAO aims to be loud and capture the attention of Crypto Twitter.\n\n### Value added\n\n- Bringing a sense of belonging to the Juno community,\n- Bringing a sense of fun and playfulness. More excitement and fireworks to Juno.\n- Keeping the Juno and Cosmos community informed of new developments happening on Juno Network.\n- Onboarding new users that enjoy culture and love to see an engaged community.\n- Devs can focus on doing dev work instead of spending time shitposting on twitter.\n\n### Funding\n\nJuno Sauce SubDAO will be initially funded with around 0 JUNO. We only ask to be paid in good vibes.\n\nGood vibes will be spent on the following:\n\n- Pay imaginary salaries for professional artists and meme makers.\n- Pay imaginary salaries for professional talkers that spend more than half their day on Twitter Spaces.\n- Pay eventual bots for Twitter engagement if needed.\n- Allocate to community-incentivized events such as Poker and Meme contests\n\nA monthly report of engagement metrics will be provided. The scope of this proposal is for 1 month.\n\n### Background\n\nMemes are one of the best ways to grow a community especially in the crypto space. Some of the biggest accounts on crypto Twitter with the largest following and engagement are simply meme accounts.\n\nMeme accounts are some of the purest forms of comedy. Memes are a form of online communication that can be a fun and effective way to share ideas and culture. They often use humor and creativity to make complex ideas more accessible, and can help bring people together around a common interest or topic. Additionally, memes can be a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing people to express their opinions and engage in political and cultural discussions in a way that is relatable and engaging. Overall, memes can be a positive force in culture by promoting communication and collaboration, as well as providing a platform for artistic expression and social commentary.\n\n### Members\n\nRekt Zerker: Professional memer and shitposter\nRektVee: Professional memer and FUDmaster\nGiannisMartakos: Professional memer, community manager and GIF artist\nKingJulianIam: DeFi content creator and analyst\nrekt_news: Who knows who they are\nBbands: Twitter Spaces extraordinaire\nCosmos Junky: He has Cosmos in his name, must be legit\nHodl Juno: He hodls Juno, definitely qualified\nTenderMint Timmy: Leader of Joes\nRobo Racoon: Can you imagine the smell?\nEmir: Good vibes person\nFarmer Stars: Makes gud memes\n\n### Why\n\nThe special sauce that brings Juno together.

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%

93,"Reduce incentives on established Major and Stable category pools

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for a staged reduction of emitted OSMO incentives to the Major/OSMO and Stable/OSMO to defer inflation as outlined below.\n\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to a staged reduction of emitted OSMO incentives to the Major/OSMO and Stable/OSMO to defer inflation as outlined below.\n\n## Details\nPrevious incentive reduction proposals have reduced the emitted quantity of OSMO to all pools. [Proposal 364](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/364) put this staged reduction in to the hands of a working group who have continued to reduce emissions down to 50% of standard. This was carried out slowly as the required hurdle rate of pools adjusts with market and liquidity changes. Several of these pools, notably the WETH, WBTC, CRO, USDC and DAI pools have had high incentives compared to their hurdle rate and have never been a factor in choosing whether to proceed with the reduction due to being excessively incentivised compared to comparable rates.\n\nMonitoring the OSMO/MAJOR and OSMO/STABLE pool GAMM levels shows that very few liquidity providers have left these pools, however new liquidity providers are not being attracted. Meanwhile, the high inflation of Osmosis is causing token value to be diluted resulting in impermanent loss in all pools as can be seen by the paired tokens in the pools decreasing faster than the GAMM tokens representing liquidity provided.\n\n[Liquidity Provided to OSMO/ATOM](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0f6dbee3-f691-44cf-9bd1-59966aaa0585.1671358036254) vs [ATOM Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1f87e0ca-e53e-4571-aaa6-8f665dc31bbd.1671358050096)\n\n[Liquidity Provided to OSMO/USDC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a20b5c74-ed9f-4251-bb32-9a84bc6a9dab.1671358062801) vs [USDC Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/31edae52-0dbb-428a-adc5-d5eda5084423.1671358077128)\n\n[Liquidity Provided to OSMO/WETH](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0a01c7f9-1ebc-479b-a52e-f67421f6ff62.1671358088408) vs [WETH Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/7065b7aa-9d10-4c74-a2ba-17c5cbbd98ef.1671358098707)\n\n[Liquidity Provided to OSMO/WBTC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/639928d6-9d38-4e06-ac76-7f639f597f73.1671358111177) vs [WBTC Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bcdf5a18-8077-42e7-91c5-b8164f1addeb.1671358123040)\n\nThis proposal aims to set the incentive rate for all established Major and Stable pools to be approximately the comparable staking rate of each half of the pools, or the OSMO staking APR, plus a 5% premium to account for impermanent loss, at the current liquidity levels.\n\nThis aims to be a preliminary step to reduce inflation of the OSMO token until target liquidity levels can be set and further measures to reduce overall inflation can be implemented.\n\nThis results in only significant changes to the OSMO/MAJOR and OSMO/STABLE categories with the following estimated effect on APR:\n[APR Chart](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/d95dee12-403f-4607-88f5-bbcfdd494038.1671358004731)\n\nWhich compares to the comparable staking rate as follows:\n[Comparable Rates](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/04c3dc33-8ae0-45ab-8c64-1cc82cdb25af.1671358014300)\n\n## Current allocations\nCommunity pool share of OSMO LP Incentives: **50%**\nLeaving 50% emitted to Liquidity Providers - **123,288 OSMO/day**\n\n**Current category shares**\n* 45% OSMO/MAJOR - 60,966 OSMO/day\n* 30% OSMO/STABLE - 40,644 OSMO/day\n* 14% OSMO/MINOR - 18,967 OSMO/day\n* 2% OTHERS - 2,710 OSMO/day\n* Up to 4% Stable/Stable\n\nThese are further normalised to 100%\n\n**Current Minimums**\n* 9 OSMO/CRO: 3%\n* 704 OSMO/WETH: 10%\n* 712 OSMO/WBTC: 10%\n* 773 OSMO/DOT: 0.5%\n* 789 OSMO/MATIC: 0.5% with 4 week sunset\n\n**Current Maximum**\n* 1 OSMO/ATOM: 25%\n\n## Proposed Allocations\nCommunity pool share of OSMO LP Incentives: **70%**\nLeaving 30% emitted to Liquidity Providers - **73,973 OSMO/day**\n\n**Proposed category shares**\nThese are normalised to 100% if the Stable/Stable allocation is not used:\n* 54% OSMO/MAJOR - 39,945 OSMO/day (-21,021, or -34%)\n* 17% OSMO/STABLE - 12,575 OSMO/day (-28,069 or -69%)\n* 25% OSMO/MINOR - 18,493 OSMO/day (-474 or -2.5%)\n* Up to 4% Stable/Stable\n\nThe OTHERS Category is being voted on removal in [Proposal 389](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/389).

* Voting YES for this proposal indicates that Axelar via Moonbeam will be considered the Canonical Bridge into the Polkadot Ecosystem for Osmosis\n\n* Voting NO for this proposal indicates that Axelar via Moonbeam will not be considered the Canonical Bridge into the Polkadot Ecosystem for Osmosis\n\nProposal 206 declared Axelar to be the Canonical Ethereum bridge for Osmosis. This has connected Osmosis to multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains including Moonbeam, an EVM parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem. \nThe expectations for bridge provision (approved in Proposal 205) established a strong preference for the winner of the bridge-off to also provide service to other ecosystems: 'At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).' \naxlDOT will soon be available via the Axelar bridge from Moonbeam. This proposal asks that axlDOT is considered to be the canonical DOT on Osmosis until a more IBC Native version of DOT is available, at which point a transition process will be proposed.\nOther assets native to the Polkadot ecosystem arriving via this route would also be treated in the same manner. \n\nCanonical status sets the following agreement:\nDefault Asset List – assets will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone default asset list, e.g. DOT with all other bridges’ assets being bridge1DOT, bridge2DOT, etc. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions.\nOsmosis Incentives – the DAO commits to prioritizing the Canonical Bridge assets, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges.

104,"Increase the Osmosis Active Validator Set to 150 Validators (from 135)

The Osmosis network is the home of the premier DEX in the IBC, and possibly the best DEX in the cryptocurrency space. Osmosis sees an impressive amount of daily traffic and serves as a central hub for investors to transfer assets between IBC networks. Because Osmosis is critically important to the IBC community, governance of the Osmosis network is extremely important. Even during the bear market, new investors continue to arrive. Representing diverse investors and their interests well as we are able aligns with the spirit of the IBC community. Increasing the number of validators in the active set from 135 to 150 would create additional opportunities for individuals and organizations to support the network as validators, and increase the options available to investors interested in selecting a validator that aligns with their philosophy for the network. While there are exceptions, across the IBC, 150 validators has become the standard size for an active set.

107,"Signaling Proposal for STRD/OSMO (#806) Incentivised Pool

- By voting **YES** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their support for adding STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to add STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the STRD/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.

STRD/OSMO (#806) is currently incentivized with a significant amount of OSMO, which was added externally by the Stride Foundation. However, liquidity depth remains low. In the coming weeks, a large STRD airdrop will be released, including 1MM STRD to OSMO stakers. It is desirable for liquidity depth to increase to facilitate the expected uptick in trading volume.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations for a number of coming Osmosis applications, the most prominent of which being Mars Protocol. Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis. It makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the STRD pool to the set of incentivized pools.

111,"Revised - [ION DAO] initialize

## Summary
Urgent announcement regarding Proposal 321:

The testnet standard parameter values in the proposal are incorrect due to typo issues. If the proposal is passed as is, the following problems might occur:

1. Short deposit / voting period allows the attacker to rush through the malicious proposal easily.
2. Low proposal deposit makes it easier to spam the DAO.

Therefore, we're submitting a new Proposal #322 with the revised parameters which we agreed with the Osmosis team as below:

Revised parameters
* unstaking period
  * `3600s` -> `1209600s` (= 14 Days)
* quorum
  * `0.3` -> `0.5` (= 50%)
* deposit period
  * `600s` -> `604800s` (= 7 Days)
* voting period
  * `800s` -> `604800s` (= 7 Days)
* proposal deposit
  * `100 uion` -> `500000 uion` (= 0.5 ION)
* minimum proposal deposit
  * `50 uion` -> `50000 uion` (= 0.05 ION)

We would like to request the community to kindly vote NO to Proposal #321, consider #322 as our proposal to instantiate ION DAO and cast your votes accordingly.

Vote **YES** on this proposal if you want to instantiate ION DAO contract on Osmosis with revised parameters.  
Vote **NO** on this proposal if you do not want to.  

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
About 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the testnet where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.  

Website: [https://ion.wtf](https://ion.wtf)  
Commonwealth Thread: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4956-proposal-put-ion-dao-contracts-on-chain-on-osmosis](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4956-proposal-put-ion-dao-contracts-on-chain-on-osmosis)

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.  

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).  

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig  

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.  

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js (React Fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features 
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee 
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list 
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal 
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description 
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the threshold is 50%

112,"Activate governance discussions on the Discourse forum using community pool funds

## Summary
Proposal to request for 1000 ATOM from the community spending pool to be sent to a multisig who will put funds towards stewardship of the Discourse forum to make it an authoritative record of governance decisions as well as a vibrant space to draft and discuss proposals.
## Details
We are requesting 1000 ATOM from the community spending pool to activate and steward the Cosmos Hub (Discourse) forum for the next six months.

Off-chain governance conversations are currently highly fragmented, with no shared public venue for discussing proposals as they proceed through the process of being drafted and voted on. It means there is no record of discussion that voters can confidently point to for context, potentially leading to governance decisions becoming delegitimized by stakeholders.

The requested amount will be sent to a multisig comprising individuals (members listed below) who can ensure that the tokens are spent judiciously. We believe stewardship of the forum requires:

* **Moderation**: Format, edit, and categorize posts; Standardize titles and tags; Monitor and approve new posts; Archive posts.
* **Facilitation**: Ask clarifying questions in post threads; Summarize discussions; Provide historical precedence to discussions.
* **Engagement**: Circulate important posts on other social channels to increase community participation; Solicit input from key stakeholders.
* **Guidance**: Orient and assist newcomers; Guide proposers through governance process; Answer questions regarding the forum or Cosmos ecosystem.
The work to steward the forum will be carried out by members of [Hypha Worker Co-op](https://hypha.coop/) and individuals selected from the community to carry out scoped tasks in exchange for ATOM from this budget.
## Multisig Members
* Hypha: Mai Ishikawa Sutton (Hypha Co-op)
* Validator: Daniel Hwang (Stakefish)
* Cosmos Hub developer: Lauren Gallinaro (Interchain Berlin)

We feel the membership of the multisig should be rotated following the six-month pilot period to preserve insight from the distinct specializations (i.e., Cosmos Hub validators and developers).
## Timeline and Deliverables
We estimate the total work to take 250-300 hours over six months where we hope to produce:
* **Moving summaries:** Provide succinct summaries of the proposals and include all publicly stated reasons why various entities are choosing to vote for/against a given proposal. These summaries will be written objectively, not siding with any one entity.
* **Validator platforms:** Create a section of the Forum where we collate all validators' visions for Cosmos Hub governance to allow them to state their positions publicly. We will work with the smaller validators to ensure they are equally represented.
* **Regular check-ins with the Cosmonaut DAO:** Collaborate with the future Cosmonaut DAO to ensure maximal accessibility and engagement. Community management is a critical, complementary aspect of increasing participation in governance.
* **Announcement channel:** Create a read-only announcement channel in the Cosmos Community Discord, so that new proposals and major discussions can be easily followed.
* **Tooling friendly posts:** Tag and categorize posts so that they can be easily ingested into existing tooling that validators have setup.
* **Neutral moderation framework:** Document and follow transparent standards for how the forum is moderated.

At the end of the period, we will produce a report reflecting on our successes and failures, and recommendations for how the work of maintaining a governance venue can be continuously sustained (e.g., through a DAO). We see this initiative as a process of discovery, where we are learning by doing.

For more context, you can read through the discussions on this [proposal on the Discourse forum](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-activate-governance-discussions-on-the-discourse-forum-using-community-pool-funds/5833).

Make Cosmos Hub the Lead Sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022

Summary:
If this proposal passes, 2600 ATOM will be allocated to the Cosmoverse team - making the ATOM community the lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022. The Cosmos Hub was the first lead supporter for Cosmoverse 2021 and we would like to keep it that way for this one as well. Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world.

Description:
Cosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 27 & 28, 2022.

Our goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.

Cosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

Where do the funds go?

The sponsorship will help us finance the Cosmoverse conference. 

The main costs include:

Conference venue
F&B (conference + afterparty)
Marketing leading up to the event
Audio and visuals
Official afterparty
Legal costs
How does it benefit the ATOM community?

By allocating 2600 ATOM from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, the Cosmos Hub will become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.

Keynote speech: If this proposal passes, we offer three keynote slots to core Cosmos contributors. We will keep you updated on this topic on the official Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website.

Logo placement: The ATOM logo will be shown as “lead sponsor” on the main conference days. We will make sure everyone at the conference knows that the ATOM community has significantly contributed to covering the conference’s costs and making this a great event.

General Admission Tickets: We will give 15 general admission tickets to the ATOM community. Distribution TBD.

Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.

Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

Event Highlights 2021 and What To Expect

Cosmoverse 2021 took place in Lisbon, Portugal. The conference brought the Cosmos community together and kick-started new developments in the interchain! The attendees were provided with food, beverages, and merchandise and were able to listen to keynotes/ panels that were held by Cosmos thought leaders. Cosmoverse is the most community-driven Cosmos conference in the world! It is organized by and for Cosmonauts. 

This means low ticket prices and no VIP areas. If you attend the conference, you have direct access to all speakers and can ask them questions. 

Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia, and will have the same community vibe - but it will be much bigger! 

There will be many Cosmos speakers at the event, two coffee breaks per day including an assortment of food, two 5-star buffet lunches, an NFT room, a public co-working zone, private meeting rooms for sponsors and their teams, and much, much more. We will be able to provide twice as many tickets as the first conference. Medellin is a vibrant city settled in between a beautiful valley in the heart of Colombia. With many activities besides the ones we will be hosting throughout the week. We will ensure that within the Cosmoverse week, attendees will have the possibility to visit side events and meet Cosmonauts from all over the world!

The Team:

Cryptocito: Cryptocito is the most prominent Cosmos YouTuber in the interchain! Who is responsible for bringing all the cosmos together, through outreach, and planning of the event.

Basil Naser: Basil is part of the Cryptocito team. Last year he founded the Cosmoverse conference with Crypotcito. He is responsible for event operations and branding.

Fabian Klauder: Fabian is the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES, a Cosmos-focused media company. He is responsible for the financing of the event.

Juri Maibaum: Juri the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES and host of the company’s podcast and YouTube show called “This Week In Cosmos”. He is responsible for outreach and bringing cosmos projects to the conference.
For Updates
We have 5 months to plan this one (for Cosmoverse 1.0 we only had 5 weeks) - so you know it will be epic.

You decide:

By voting “Yes” you believe that the ATOM community should become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

By voting “No” you think that the ATOM community should not become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

122,"Bootstrapping liquidity for Mars Protocol through Spend of Redirected Incentives

This proposal would transfer 310,000 OSMO from the community pool, to be used as pool rewards over 90 days in order to bootstrap Mars liquidity on Osmosis.

## Details
Mars protocol is a Money Market and Credit protocol initially launched on Terra that will be launching a Cosmos chain as the hub of its operations for the IBC network.  Mars' first outpost of operations will be on Osmosis as the home of the deepest liquidity across IBC and enable users to lend, borrow and earn against Mars governance gated credit lines.

Mars protocol wishes to quickly build liquidity on Osmosis to provide stability for the governance of their credit module and proposes that it is in Osmosis' interest to assist in funding this stability to ensure the security of and smooth operation of its outpost.

At the time of the Terra De-peg (May 7, 2022), the Mars fully diluted market cap was $797 Million, with a contained liquidity of [$263 Million](https://defillama.com/protocol/mars-protocol). The Mars token itself had [~$32 Million](https://forum.astroport.fi/t/arc-6-add-astro-emissions-for-the-mars-ust-pool/308/11) liquidity in the MARS/UST Astroport pair, the dominant Terra exchange. Under current market conditions, and the average trading value in the post-depeg climate, a MARS pool liquidity of around $3.4 million should still be achievable. [Calculations here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVVBusqYSVi3VSNvJBGs0QtpkOZamcaC2AB5i_1WzqU/edit?usp=sharing).

In order to achieve this rapidly and establish Osmosis as the primary marketplace for the Mars token, as well as ensure that the first outpost is established on solid ground, this proposal asks for a spending of previously redirected incentives to provide bootstrapping rewards for the MARS/OSMO pool.

A community pool spend of 310,000 OSMO will be allocated to 14-day bonding within the OSMO/MARS pool over 90 days. This should cause liquidity to quickly reach the post-depeg levels of liquidity based on the current Osmosis value, the average price of the Mars token after the UST depeg, before the pool APR becomes comparable to alternative pools of this size. This spend should be considered to be a deployment of incentives previously redirected from normal OSMO incentives to the community pool.

If the canonical status of one of these assets is changed then incentives would move at the next routine proposal to the pool containing the new canonical assets, with the highest volume and matching the criteria stated in [Proposal 377](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/377).\n\n Stable pools are incentivised by the model defined in [Proposal 377](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/377). In brief, incentivised pools receive a subsidy of up to 2 times the value of fees generated in the pool in OSMO, with the total of the Stable/Stable category being capped as 4% of current Liquidity Provider emissions.\n\n This proposal depends on the passing of Proposals [402](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/402) and [403](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/403), which recognise USDT and BUSD as Stablecoin assets on Osmosis. If this proposal passes whilst one of the referenced proposals fail then it would have no immediate effect as one of the constituent assets would not be recognised as a Stablecoin asset. If all constituent assets become recognised by Osmosis governance as Stablecoin assets in future then this proposal would take effect.\n\n## About USDC\nUSDC is a stablecoin redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars, backed by dollar-denominated assets held in segregated accounts with US-regulated financial institutions and issued by Circle.\nWebsite: [https://www.circle.com/en/usdc](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)\n## About USDT\nLaunched in 2014, Tether was the first stablecoin issued and remains the most prevalent stablecoin in use across the crypto ecosystem.\nWebsite: https://tether.to/\n\n## About BUSD\nBUSD is a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin approved by NYDFS and issued by Paxos on Ethereum.

# Summary
This proposal aims to put forward a clear definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ that provides a stand-alone reference for future Cosmos Hub votes. We examine the technical context and existing discussion on ‘NoWithVeto’, and the range of ways the community understands NoWithVeto. We bridge these ideas into a coherent and thorough definition proposed below.

If passed, changes will be made to the Cosmos Hub documentation and Cosmos Hub Forum templates to reflect the newly accepted definition.

# Proposed Definition for NoWithVeto

***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***

Note: In this definition we use the term “rules of engagement” to refer to practices adopted by the Cosmos Hub community through governance. These may include decision-making processes and social protocols that have passed governance and thus been accepted as rules.

The following is factually correct about how ‘NoWithVeto’ currently operates and will continue to operate regardless of this proposal’s outcome: If quorum is met and greater than 1/3 of participating voting power have voted ‘NoWithVeto’, the proposal fails and is considered to be vetoed. In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.

# Discussion
## Summary of existing definitions
This list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.

1. **As a stronger No:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.
2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.
3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.
4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).
5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.
6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.

## Censorship
It may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3% of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2% of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.

## Financial and social cost
‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2% of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.

Consequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. 

While there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.

# Conclusion
We are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.

Cosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.

# Voting options
We propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:

***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***

Your vote on this proposal indicates the following:
* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.
* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal. Please indicate why in the [Cosmos Hub Forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898).
* **NO WITH VETO** - ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.
* **ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.",0

137,"Allow Apollo DAO LP Vault Contracts to be Uploaded

This proposal gives the address osmo1wl59k23zngj34l7d42y9yltask7rjlnxgccawc7ltrknp6n52fps94qsjd the ability to upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis without seeking further governance approval for each upload. This address is a multisig administered by Apollo DAO.

The CosmWasm contracts that Apollo DAO would be uploading for our LP Vaults would be our:
* LP Vault Contract (compounding vaults for Osmosis)
* Zapper Contract (enabling users to enter and exit vaults directly with just Osmo)
* Liquidity Helper Contract (deals with providing liquidity,  withdrawing liquidity and swapping)
* CW DEX Router (finds the most efficient routes to swap assets when entering and exiting vaults)

Apollo’s LP Vaults have been audited by Oak Security, [with the audit report available to view here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/master/Apollo).

Governance approval for contract upload was originally intended to keep the set of DApps running on Osmosis consistent with its objective of being a DeFi hub for the Interchain.

While this proposal gives authority for osmo1wl59k23zngj34l7d42y9yltask7rjlnxgccawc7ltrknp6n52fps94qsjd to permissionlessly upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis, governance only signals approval for contracts relating to the function of Apollo DAO’s LP Vaults.

## About Apollo DAO
Apollo DAO is a collective of CosmWasm developers and DeFi natives that focuses on building DAO tooling and asset management for the Cosmos ecosystem. Apollo’s primary focus in the short term is to create and enable additional advanced yield strategies for Cosmos, while improving the user experience through automation.

145,"Aid Proposal for Earthquake Survivors in Türkiye

Aid Proposal for Earthquake Survivors in Türkiye

On 02.06.2023, two catastrophic earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.6 and 7.8 occurred in the Kahramanmaraş in Turkey. In addition to Kahramanmaraş, many earthquakes and aftershocks were experienced in Adıyaman, Kilis, Şanlıurfa, Diyarbakır, Adana, Osmaniye, Gaziantep, Malatya and Hatay. According to the statement made by Japanese earthquake expert Shinji Toda, “We can say that the Kahramanmaraş earthquake is the largest earthquake in the world to have occurred on land. 
6207 buildings were destroyed, and many buildings became unusable. More than 13 million people are affected. According to the statement made on February 9, the loss of life is 17406 and the number of injured is 71806. 

We need the support of many people from all over the world in this catastrophic event, which has been declared a Level 3 Emergency by the World Health Organization.

Although it is a great humanitarian need, we are aware that this proposal puts a great burden on all voters and may put them in a dilemma, but we had to take such route due to the urgency of the situation. In addition to being a support that prevents great pain, this proposal unfortunately opens a door for opportunistic people to use it in the future. It creates a great moral dilemma as to who will receive and how much support, or whether to give support to anyone who asks for it. In order to prevent this, it is of great importance for the good of the whole cosmos that the next charity proposals must be run through a Charity DAO. That's why we're asking for both your support and the establishment of a Charity DAO. And again, the reason why we did not establish this proposal through the Charity DAO is that every passing second is costing a human life.

The funds will be transferred to the Ihtiyac haritası (https://www.ihtiyacharitasi.org/ , https://www.needsmap.coop/ ), which is one of Turkey's most reliable non-governmental organizations, which still continues its search and rescue activities in the earthquake zone. The Cosmos Account of the Ihtiyaç haritası has been approved by the T.C. Financial Crimes Investigation Agency “MASAK”. Since the account has been opened on the local crypto exchange (Paribu), funds will be transferred to the organization's Paribu account via multisig. In order not to harm the Cosmos ecosystem, the funds received will be converted into Turkish lira by Paribu (the crypto exchange in Turkey used by Ahbap and Ihtiyaç haritası for the funds) without being sold on the market, and Paribu will use these funds as liquidity.

146,"Allow Mars Outpost Contracts to be Uploaded to Osmosis

This proposal would allow osmo1cd4nn8yzdrrsfqsmmvaafq8r03xn38qgqt8fzh to upload contracts for a Mars Protocol outpost on Osmosis.

## Details
This proposal gives the address osmo1cd4nn8yzdrrsfqsmmvaafq8r03xn38qgqt8fzh the ability to upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis without seeking further governance approval for each upload. This address is administered by Delphi Labs.

Governance approval for contract upload was originally intended to keep the set of DApps running on Osmosis consistent with its objective of being a DeFi hub for the Interchain.

While this proposal gives authority for osmo1cd4nn8yzdrrsfqsmmvaafq8r03xn38qgqt8fzh to permissionlessly upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis, governance only signals approval for contracts relating to the function of a Mars Protocol Outpost.

## About Mars Protocol
Mars protocol is a Money Market and Credit protocol initially launched on Terra that has launched a Cosmos chain as the hub of its operations for the IBC network.  Mars' first outpost of operations will be on Osmosis as the home of the deepest liquidity across IBC and enable users to lend, borrow and earn against Mars governance gated credit lines.

By voting **YES**, the OGP will be launched with 1,500,000 OSMO tokens from the community pool.

By voting **NO**, OSMO holders voice their dissent against the OGP.

**Details**
- An Osmosis Grants Program (“OGP”) should be launched to fund new community-built tooling, infrastructure and projects building on top of Osmosis.

- We propose an initial budget for the program of up to 1,500,000 OSMO tokens for a 6 month program with quarterly community review. OGP is not obligated to spend this amount; quality always comes first.

- Funds will be managed by a 7 person multi-sig consisting of:
- Sunny Aggarwal (Osmosis team)
- Figment
- Eddie Hartmann (Osmosis team)
- Cosmostation
- Brandon Curtis (Independent)
- Coldchain (Independent)
- Dan Elitzer (Nascent)

- At the end of the initial six month term and then every quarter thereafter, the community can terminate the program via governance and any unspent OSMO tokens will be returned to the community pool.

- The program would be run by a Program Lead (Reverie) supported by seven reviewers, who also function as the multi-sig. Reverie has been working closely with the Osmosis team and the committee for the past few months for setup.

- Reverie proposes monthly compensation of $70k while it is administering the OGP as well a $100k one time setup grant to permit best in class legal and operational setup.

- As part of this proposal, weve included a preliminary version of the website, as well as an initial set of funding RFP ideas.

168,"Signaling Proposal for ATOM/stATOM (#803) Incentivised Pool

- By voting **YES** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO matched incentives to the ATOM/stATOM (#803) pool on Osmosis.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO matched incentives to the ATOM/stATOM (#803) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to give matched OSMO incentives to ATOM/stATOM (#803). This pool falls into the “other” incentive category, which gets 2% of OSMO incentives. So the ATOM/stATOM pool would get part of that 2% of OSMO incentives.

The pool is externally incentivized with 375,000 STRD over 45 days. Matched incentives expire when current external incentives end. At that point, Stride will likely submit a new proposal for the stATOM/ATOM pool to be added to the set of pools that receive regular incentives.

After this signaling proposal has passed governance, this pool will begin the onboarding process.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations for a number of coming Osmosis applications, the most prominent of which being Mars Protocol.

* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates approval that a further 21% of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives should be redirected to the community pool to lower direct Osmosis inflation until governance returns it.\n\n* Voting No for this proposal indicates that 29% shall continue to be the proportion of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives that are redirected to the community pool.\n\n## Background\nOsmosis emits a fixed amount of OSMO per day as inflation, which decreases with each thirdening event. \n45% of this inflation is allocated to Liquidity Incentives and 71% of that is distributed between liquidity providers according to the incentives system resulting in a current emission of 174,978 OSMO per day to pay for liquidity.\nThe remaining 29% is redirected to the community pool to be used for future liquidity incentives when emissions have decreased and the broader market supports higher inflationary APR as a method of attracting new liquidity providers.\n\n## State of Token Liquidity Growth\nOsmosis has seen a steady growth of token liquidity over the last 6 months, particularly in the OSMO/Major and OSMO/Stable pools that receive the majority of liquidity incentive allocations.\n\nAs was observed in [Proposal 268](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/268), liquidity pools tend to grow when the incentives provided are greater than that of independently staking the two halves of the pool, plus a small additional yield that compensates for Impermanent Loss.\nNotable examples of this include:\n* Evmos [where the liquidity drastically increased after external incentives (22nd July) helped compensate for the higher Evmos Staking APR](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/f1c3a9f2-4678-48cf-92a4-8630b60f812e.1668440485580)\n* Juno [where liquidity stagnated until 24th October when the Juno Halvening made Liquidity Provision a better choice again](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/694ebc77-5ba9-4868-81f2-dfa967d1cfde.1668440516112)\n\nFor completeness, other major pools over the last six months include:\n* [WBTC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bd34d3de-1ad0-4fbb-b07d-063ecc9c5bf6.1667579137376)\n* [WETH](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/9560938f-bb15-49de-90e1-06b5e750c29a.1667579147574)\n* [CRO](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/d4bd737e-8b30-4db7-af30-6cbc6e4b1469.1667579157107)\n* [DOT](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0a2d7495-c5d1-41d7-9fdd-41be3e6b73cc.1667579166070)\nThese all have steadily increased whilst being allocated high incentives.\n\nStables seem to act differently, potentially as during the current bear market they may be seen to have poor potential.

This is an effective 30% reduction in current liquidity emissions.\n\nWhile Osmosis' contribution to a pool's APR from Liquidity Incentives is reduced, APR gained from Swap Fees, External Incentives and Superfluid Staking will be unaffected. This results in smaller APR changes in pools with already lower APR as follows:\n[APR Changes](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ea42ca02-ff4a-46e1-8a96-be95ed64c55f.1668435674138)\nJackal, stOSMO and Tori are cut off but have no changes as they are unincentivised by Osmosis at the time of writing.\n\nThis results in the following change to the Liquidity vs Staking chart, showing where pools are currently trending towards and where they would be trending towards after this reduction completes:\n[Current Trending vs Trending after Reduction](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a9ce040b-047f-45dd-abed-fd951cb66202.1668435703320)\n\nThis shows that even with this reduction, LP rewards will remain superior to alternative token uses whilst reducing the amount that Osmosis pays each day to continue to maintain and grow token liquidity.\n\nIn order to ensure this reduction goes smoothly, an informal group will be formed to oversee each step change. This group consists of\n* Chaos Labs (Incentives Optimisation Infrastructure)\n* Flipside Flan (Flipside)\n* Hathor Nodes (Validator & Incentives Optimisation Researcher)\n* Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Labs)\n* RedRabbit (Osmosis Community)\n\nBy a majority consensus, governance entrusts the five (5) member working group to use their best judgement to delay or halt the implementation of the second and or third 7% weekly redirection in order to ensure that this reduction in incentives does not negatively impact token liquidity. The working group DOES NOT have the ability to revert any redirections that have occurred or change the amount that is to be redirected so that it does not equal the 7% defined in this proposal. The working group will communicate to governance on Commonwealth on a weekly basis whether to expect the second and or third weekly redirection to be postponed due to any yet unforeseen extenuating circumstances.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7501-further-reduction-of-lp-emissions](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7501-further-reduction-of-lp-emissions)",0

172,"Remove Exit Fee option from pools


Passing this proposal indicates that the Exit Fee option should be removed from all new and existing pools in a future software upgrade.\n\n## Details\nExit fees are an option that can be enabled at the point of pool creation. These cause Liquidity Providers to pay a fee when withdrawing from the pool. Users withdraw their tokens, minus a proportion of the LP shares, for the exit fee. These LP shares are burned, resulting in pro-rata distribution to remaining LPs.\n\nAs a method of retaining liquidity their usefulness is questionable. A liquidity provider who wishes to leave the pool will likely regard a small 0.1% fee as negligible compared to their reasoning for leaving, such as migration to another pool or confirming their current ratio of assets.\n\nA larger fee may be better at retaining liquidity, however, these begin to prevent users from leaving the pool without sacrificing earned rewards and therefore increase the hurdle for users to overcome the sunk cost fallacy on declining pools.\n\nCurrently there is no display of the exit fee on the [Osmosis.zone](http://Osmosis.zone) frontend and so a user may not be aware of this fee when joining a pool, therefore being unable to estimate the time they must provide liquidity for before their returns outweigh the exit fee. If this proposal is rejected then this should be added to make users aware of potential exit fees on pools.\n\nVery few pools have utilised exit fees during the lifetime of Osmosis, the majority of which are abandoned. All pools currently utilising Exit fees are listed below.\n\nThis proposal argues that the option to have exit fees is at best, obsolete, with other methods of liquidity stickiness such as the now default 14 day bonding time, and at worst harmful to the Osmosis liquidity provision experience. Accommodating this setting in frontend displays and integrations causes unnecessary complexity and so this setting should be removed during a future software upgrade.\n\nDuring removal, all pools with Exit Fee settings will have it removed and no future pools will be able to add one.\n\n## Affected pools\n553 - LIKE/OSMO\n596 - BOOT/ATOM\n555 - LIKE/ATOM\n905 - DYS/OSMO\n597 - BOOT/OSMO\n802 - ATOM/stATOM\n654 - CRBRUS/HUAHUA\n595 - BOOT/ATOM\n696 - GLX/OSMO\n551 - LIKE/OSMO\n552 - LIKE/ATOM\n554 - LIKE/ATOM\n652 - CRBRUS/OSMO\n655 - CRBRUS/HUAHUA\n657 - CRBRUS/HUAHUA\n797 - UMEE/HOPE\n\n[Including Liquidity and Exit Fee settings](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/4d2aac4a-1d35-487f-bca2-bc8d6ec994d7.1676301806551)\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9793-remove-exit-fee-option-from-pools](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9793-remove-exit-fee-option-from-pools)",0

0. Summary

Babylon proposes a 3-phase integration to allow Osmosis to leverage the security  of the Bitcoin network and enjoy benefits such as fast stake unbonding and extra security for high-valued transactions. This signaling proposal serves a dual purpose: it not only signals the Osmosis community's intent to integrate phase 1 shortly after Babylon mainnet, but also provides a clear roadmap for the integration process. Phases 2 and 3 will be specified and voted for by the community in future governance proposals.

CommonWealth forum post: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9967-babylon-integration-proposal-with-osmosis

We have created an FAQ based on the feedback we received from the community which can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1NmMZZTtWPJRWJXwPtAWIykAPDmPaZx4OgyL8fS2ik/edit?usp=sharing

1. Overview

The Babylon project allows PoS chains to leverage Bitcoin security. Babylon uses Bitcoin to timestamp critical PoS consensus data (such as headers with quorum certificate). This secure timestamping resolves a fundamental security threat to PoS chains that allows attackers to fork the chain without being slashed, known as the long-range attack.
But Babylon doesn’t just protect against long-range attacks. The same secure timestamping also improves the security dynamics for Cosmos PoS chains. To name a few: It allows for a shorter unbonding period without impacting the PoS chain’s security. It allows Osmosis clients to enjoy additional security for important high-valued transactions. It also allows for easier state sync and snapshot verification for node operators. It can also help with the IBC client initialization and verification, which is particularly important for Osmosis. 

2. Additional Context

Babylon has conducted several events around Bitcoin security for Cosmos with Osmosis and Juno among others. There has been strong Cosmos community support for these efforts with 150+ people signing up for these events. Sunny from Osmosis has spoken at these events with great community receptivity from both the Babylon and Osmosis communities.
3. Summary of the Three Phases of Integration
Babylon proposes a 3-phase integration to allow Osmosis to leverage the security and availability of the Bitcoin network. At its core, Babylon verifies Osmosis’ critical consensus data (called checkpoints) submitted by IBC relayers and aggregates the checkpoints for secure Bitcoin timestamps.
The table below summarizes the integration phases. In particular, Phase-1 integration is permissionless, since it only involves a standard IBC connection without any code changes to Osmosis. Yet it can already unlock Bitcoin security for Osmosis. All the integrations will be thoroughly reviewed and tested on Osmosis testnet first. Separate governance proposals will be submitted for mainnet integrations.

Three Phase Table
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF2xpu0reAbBHfNz4dult8DrPux-mnTZx3qP9SWQsug/edit?usp=sharing

The Babylon integration will not impact the infrastructure and operations of Osmosis validators and relayers. It will provide extra information and tools that help them secure the network. 


4. More Details about the Integrations 

Phase-1: The Oracle

IBC relayer’s client sync functionality will automatically submit Osmosis’ signed headers to Babylon. These headers will enter the Babylon ledger and be verified, and will receive secure BTC timestamps. Then any Babylon node can serve as an oracle for queries about:
the BTC-finalized Osmosis headers
whether there were long-range attacks to Osmosis
This information provides objective trusted heights and headers that allow Osmosis node operators (such as validators) and IBC relayer operators to bootstrap and verify Osmosis full nodes, light clients, and snapshots. It also allows Osmosis’ counterparty chains to verify their Osmosis IBC client.
Below is an example API call to a Babylon node for the query: 
>> https://<ip>:<port>/babylon/zoneconcierge/v1/finalized_chain_info/{chain_id} 
The Babylon team will also maintain an API server and web service for better visualization and usability. For example, Babylon’s web service can display real-time updates of the partner chain’s latest information.
The Babylon team will also provide additional standalone tools to verify the correctness of any Babylon nodes. 
Phase-2: On-Chain Automation
The Babylon team will work with the community to design and develop an IBC application module that handles BTC timestamps and associated proofs sent by Babylon. Osmosis will import this module to its App struct. The module will work standalone and thus will not require changes to other codes, nor impact existing functionalities.
Compared to Phase-1 where Osmosis users will need to access Babylon oracle nodes for Osmosis’ BTC timestamp information, this phase will enable the following on-chain automation:
automatically decide the latest headers finalized by BTC 
automatically detect and alert any forking attacks on partner chain observed by Babylon
This phase will also be an enabler of Phase-3 integration, which utilizes the on-chain BTC timestamp information.

Osmosis x Babylon Genesis swap

In order to foster a sense of cohesion and shared purpose between our communities, Babylon will be implementing a strategic initiative during Phase 2 of our project. As part of this initiative, we will be requesting token swap. These funds will be added to Babylon's community pool and will be utilized to support the growth and development of the Babylon partnership with Osmosis.

Key components of this initiative will be the delegation and staking of the acquired OSMO and bootstrapping liquidity pools. This will not only help to secure the network and support the underlying blockchain, but will also provide a way for Osmosis to actively participate in the growth and success of Babylon. By ensuring that the genesis swap is being used to support both ecosystems, we believe that we can effectively promote alignment and a sense of shared ownership among our communities.

Overall, this initiative is a crucial step towards building a strong and united partnership, and we are confident that it will play a key role in the long-term success of Babylon and integrations of bitcoin security on Osmosis. Details of the genesis swap will be included in a future prop (phase2).

BABYLON/OSMO liquidity bootstrapping pool on Osmosis
Babylon available on Osmosis
Aligned success for both communities 
Diversify both babylon and Osmosis community pool 

Phase-3: Unbonding Time Reduction 

The Babylon team and Osmosis team will work together to hook Osmosis’ staking module with the IBC application module imported in Phase-2. The stake unbonding/undelegating request approval conditions will be updated to include the associated Osmosis block’s BTC finalization information provided by the IBC application module.
The BTC finalization time will be a configurable parameter. It enables a configurable stake unbonding time that can be as short as 15-30 hours, which is much shorter than the current 14 days.
(The Babylon team is also researching other use cases of BTC security with the community.)
5. Pro's of this Proposal
Better security for Osmosis 
Osmosis will become BTC secured with BTC-assisted node / light client bootstrapping and verification enabled, which is particularly useful for Osmosis validator and relayer operators
Optionally, much shorter unbonding time (as short as 15-30 hours, and is configurable by Osmosis) may increase the number of Osmosis community members (especially OSMO stakers such as validators and delegators) because it gives them higher liquidity and can also significantly reduce the “idle” capital that does not earn yield due to the unbonding period.
Babylon community will engage with Osmosis, increasing usage, community engagement and TVL
More institutional players may engage with Osmosis due to increased security of the chain through the Babylon integration increasing TVL
The integration will increase censorship resistance of Cosmos zones including Osmosis
6. Cons of this Proposal
Having a steady stream of IBC transactions will somewhat increase the size of osmosis blocks. The additional size per Osmosis block will be in the order of the Osmosis header size.
There will be additional development and relaying commitment, but Babylon is partnered with Cosmos’ leading relayers.

The Osmosis Grants Program (OGP) has been active for 6 months, and is now looking to renew for an additional 12 months with some changes to the program. The details are outlined below.

**Details**

- The OGP will continue its core objective of issuing grants to contributors that can deliver long-term value to Osmosis.

- The OGP will add to this objective the incubation of new subDAOs and Strategic Initiatives to tackle protocol functions.

- Reverie will continue to serve as Grants Lead and is requesting 55,000 USDC and 25,000 OSMO per month in renewed compensation.

- Reverie will add more transparency through monthly reporting, calls, and other frequent reports.

- Jeremy Parish and Monetsupply will be added as two new signers on the OGP multi-sig.

As part of this proposal, the community will have an option to terminate Reverie’s involvement with the OGP after 6 months.

This proposal intends to supersede [Proposal 199](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/199) by defining a set of standards for putting a proposal into voting period on Osmosis.\n\nProposals that have not met these criteria should be met with `NoWithVeto`.\n\n# Standards\nGovernance proposals must be posted as a draft on Commonwealth for at least three days before being submitted to chain to allow feedback.\n\n## CosmWasm Storecode Proposals\n*`wasm-store`, `migrate-contract`* \n\nCosmWasm StoreCode Proposals must contain the following information at minimum:\n* Git Commit ID or release\n* Version of Compiler used\n* A description of the code's purpose for a layman\n\nStoreCode Proposals must be posted with full text and links to the code to be deployed for a minimum of 7 days before being submitted to chain to allow deeper review.\n\n# Exemptions\n## Expedited Proposals\n*Proposals Utilising the `--expedited` flag implemented in V12* \n\nAny proposal utilising the Expedited status as defined in [Proposal 278](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/278) is exempt from this requirement.\nUse of this mechanism for non-urgent situations should be met with `NoWithVeto`.\nUrgent situations must be clearly communicated as such with a corresponding Commonwealth post.\n\n## Software and IBC Updates\n*Currently `software-upgrade`, `cancel-software-upgrade`, `ibc-upgrade`, `update-client` commands* \n\nSoftware and IBC updates are not required to be posted for review. \nThe coordination of Software Upgrade proposals is typically carried out in more direct channels between Developers and Validators and may be subject to sudden changes in scheduling. \nIBC Maintenance proposals are required when an IBC channel has become stale due to lack of use. Osmosis governance recommends that these proposals are discussed in direct channels between relayers to ensure that the settings are correctly configured.\n\n## Routine Incentive Adjustment Proposals\n*`update-pool-incentives` proposals are routinely submitted via the incentives process wallet [osmo1ahtwxyl7v5qu347u07lwxxkz4dpxpl48yr4une](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo1ahtwxyl7v5qu347u07lwxxkz4dpxpl48yr4une)* \n\nRoutine incentive proposals are not required to be posted for review. \nAll other incentive adjustment proposals will be treated as standard proposals and require a 3-day waiting period unless expedited.\n\n## Resubmissions\nResubmissions of proposals previously seen on chain, such as authorisation for continued matching of External Incentives to a pool, confirmation of continuing incentivisation of a pool, or resubmitting a failed proposal after further discussion may reference the original Commonwealth thread with updated values. However, good practice would be to make a new post linked to the previous one.\n\n# Recommendations and Clarifications \n\nProposers should actively seek and redirect feedback to Commonwealth by publicising their draft proposal. \n\nProposers should respond to commenters to address any concerns and adjust the proposal criteria in line with constructive feedback and Osmosis community sentiment. \n\nChanges to the proposal should have a comment posted detailing the changes as this notifies participants that a change has occurred. \n\nA proposal should ideally have reached a negotiated consensus that is likely to pass before progressing to chain. \n\nContentious proposals may still be loaded as long as the Commonwealth thread is available for a voter to reference for any counterarguments.\n\n## CosmWasm Storecode Proposals\n*`wasm-store`,`migrate-contract`* \n\nCode walkthrough sessions are recommended to ensure the deployment is secure through exposure to many eyes.\n\n## Community Spend Proposals\n*`community-pool-spend`* \n\nCommunity Spend Proposals are recommended to be posted for review for at least 7 days.\n\n## Parameter Changes\n*'param-change'* \n\nParameter change proposals should include a link to a successful proposal on the Osmosis Testnet.

After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST.  IST liquidity will be incentivized through the Cosmos ecosystem, with Osmosis being a critical early destination.\n\n The authors believe that it would be in the best interests of the community to incentivize an OSMO-IST pool to drive deep eventual liquidity and easy access from any other Osmosis token \n\n Additionally, it is requested that IST be enabled and listed as an asset on app.osmosis.zone. The OSMO/IST pool should be listed as well in the main app.\n\n ## What is IST?\n\n IST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric’s unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric’s model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.\n\n For its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST.  Each PSM accepts another Cosmos stablecoin and mints IST in exchange.  There are currently four PSM contracts running, accepting USDC and USDT over both Axelar and Gravity bridges, each with different minting limits.  Rationale for the current minting limits was explained by the elected governance committee here: https://community.agoric.com/t/ist-minting-limits-for-inter-protocol-mvp-launch/87/1 \n\n Additional PSMs may be added by governance to accept new IBC-accessible stablecoins. \n]\n IST’s next iteration will include overcollateralized vaults, which will drive a major unlock for minting capability and allow the token to diversify away from bridge risk and stablecoin centralization risk.\n\n User Docs: https://docs.inter.trade/ \n Analytics: https://analytics.inter.trade/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/inter_protocol \n Discord Link: https://discord.com/invite/interprotocol",0

- By voting YES on this proposal, external PSTAKE incentives will be matched at ~$2,222 per day
- By voting NO on this proposal, external PSTAKE incentives will NOT be matched at ~$2,222 per day

**Context**
The PSTAKE team has allocated 500,000 PSTAKE across PSTAKE/OSMO pool 648 that amounts to ~$200,000 over the course of 90 epochs (Started on 07-05-2022)

199,"Upgrade stOSMO, stJUNO, and stSTARS Pools to Stableswap

This proposal is to upgrade the following constant product pools to the new stableswap pool type: stOSMO/OSMO (#833), JUNO/stJUNO (#817), STARS/stSTARS (#810).

The stableswap pool type is more suitable for these liquid staked derivative pools, as the two tokens in each pool are pegged.

The address “osmo1k8c2m5cn322akk5wy8lpt87dd2f4yh9afcd7af,” a multisig controlled by the Stride Foundation, will be used as the scaling factor governor for all three pools. That means that this address will be able to adjust the stToken : token ratio (i.e. peg) where liquidity is concentrated, which is necessary because the peg shifts as the stToken gains value against the token.

The swap fee for all three pools, which is currently 0.3%, will be reduced to 0.05%.

This is a signaling proposal. If approved by Osmosis governance, the pool upgrades will be bundled with the next Osmosis chain upgrade.

202,"Implement Price Oracle on Juno

# Implement Price Oracle on Juno\n\nThis is a signaling proposal regarding the implementation of an on-chain Price Oracle to Juno.\n\nCommonwealth Proposal and Discussions can be seen [here](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7325-oracle) and [here](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7751-implement-price-oracle-on-juno).\n\n### Pros\n\n- A Price Oracle supports many DeFi use cases that are currently difficult (or impossible) to implement on Juno. Many major DeFi protocols depend upon decentralized price feeds to function correctly. This is a rapid solution to provide that functionality.\n- Currently, projects on Juno wanting to access price feeds have to pay excessive fees to access these feeds, which can be prohibitive for a start-up.\n- Implementing a Price Oracle on Juno natively would give Juno (and the community) control over this public good.\n- Even if better solutions come along, this is a rapidly implementable stop-gap solution that can be deployed. Future oracles and providers may improve upon this service.\n- Juno would be the first *permissionless* CosmWasm chain with an on-chain Price Oracle, which is a valid differentiator for builders seeking to deploy DeFi protocols in a permissionless environment.\n\n### Cons\n\n- Validators will have to run additional software to ensure the price oracle is decentralized. Failure to do so will result in soft-slashing, so Juno stakers and validators face a non-zero risk of soft-slashing. Soft-slashing is set at 0.01% on Juno. *(The slashing window is an adjustable parameter and will be set conservatively at first to allow validators to gain software familiarity.)*\n- Some blockchains have already added price oracles, though none are permissionless. This is a solution that exists on chains such as Kujira and Umee.\n- Oracle TX fees have to be paid from a common pool, and ultimately there is a cost to the community for those tokens.\n\n## Voting\n\n- Vote **YES** if you\'d like Juno to implement this Price Oracle solution as per the above.\n- Vote **NO** if you don\'t want Juno to implement this Price Oracle solution as per above.\n- By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote for or against the proposal.\n- Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",0

204,"Add AVAX to the list of Major category assets

This proposal would add AVAX to the list of assets that Osmosis recognises as strategically important for growth, increasing the incentives allocated to it.\n\n## Details\nAVAX is currently the rank 18 cryptocurrency by marketcap with a valuation of around .4 Billion, 12 times higher than Osmosis. wAVAX is the wrapped version of this able to be used across Avalance Network DeFi, for the purposes of bridged assets to other chains these are treated the same.\nThe majority of trade volume happens on alternative decentralised exchanges for wAVAX and centralised exchanges for AVAX, not on Osmosis.\nThis proposal asks if Osmosis has a strategic interest in attracting more liquidity of AVAX and so will enable it to access a greater proportion of liquidity incentives.\n\n## About AVAX\nAVAX is the native token of the Avalanche platform and is used to secure the network through staking, pay for fees, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple subnetworks created on the Avalanche platform. wAVAX is the wrapped version of AVAX that enables use on the Avalanche network.\nWebsite: [https://www.avax.network/](https://www.avax.network/)\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9547-onboarding-of-new-major-token-pool-avax](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9547-onboarding-of-new-major-token-pool-avax)",0
205,"Phase out incentives for BUSD

This proposal would wind down all OSMO incentives involving the BUSD stablecoin over the following two weeks.\n\n## Details\nOn the 13th February 2023, Paxos, the issuer of the BUSD stablecoin, released a [statement](https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/) that they will cease further issuance on the 21st February 2023.\n\nThis impacts Osmosis as we have recently voted to [recognise BUSD as a stable asset](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/403), [onboard a Core Stableswap pool](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/404) containing BUSD, [incentivise the BUSD/OSMO pool](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/425) and [bootstrap it by allocating initial liquidity incentives](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/426).\n\nWhile the cessation of issuance is concerning, Paxos have attestations of full backing and intend to support redemption of BUSD until February 2024. Therefore this proposal is not an emergency proposal and will stagger the removal of incentives from BUSD related pools to give users time to unbond.\n\n## Proposed Plan\nThis signalling proposal lays out the path to removing BUSD incentives and has no direct effect.\n\nAt the first routine incentives proposal after passing the following would occur:\n* Minimum Incentive allocation to Pool 879 removed (Proposal 426 Reversion), lowering incentives to a standard level for a stable pool.\n\nAt the second routine incentives proposal after passing the following would occur:\n* Removal of Osmosis Incentives from OSMO/BUSD pool (Proposal 425 Reversion)\n* Removal of Osmosis Incentives from USDC/USDT/BUSD pool (Proposal 404 Reversion)\n* Removal of BUSD as a Stable asset (Proposal 403 Reversion) \n\nCommonwealth Thread: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9998-busd-wind-down](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9998-busd-wind-down)",0

212,"Reduce OSMO/ATOM Pool Swap fee to 0.2%

Voting YES for this proposal would reduce the Pool 1 (OSMO/ATOM) swap fee from 0.3% to 0.2% \n\nVoting NO for this proposal indicates that the Pool 1 (OSMO/ATOM) swap fee should remain unchanged at 0.3%\n\n Background\n With the passing of Proposal 187 (Multihop Discount on Osmosis Pools) most trades should be routed through OSMO pools. \n OSMO pools mostly have swap fees set at 0.2%, however the major ATOM/OSMO pool (#1) has a swap fee of 0.3%. This causes some direct trades between ATOM/X to have a lower, or identical cost in swap fee to the multi-hop routes. As trades via OSMO pools usually benefit from their higher liquidity and so have lower slippage costs in comparison to non-OSMO pools they may still be the more optimal route for larger trades. The use of OSMO pools as the optimal trade route for user purchases is beneficial for Osmosis.\n Ideally this would be voted on purely by Pool 1 Liquidity Providers, however pool sub-governance is not functional yet and so this will be asked of all Osmosis governance and implemented during the next software upgrade if passed. \n Pool 1 Liquidity Providers specifically should see compensatory swap fees generated from the new routes passing through the pool as well as increased frequency of volatility harvesting as mentioned in the multihop proposal.\n\n Affected routes:\n From Identical swap fees to Multihop being having lower swap fees: ATOM/JUNO, ATOM/STARS, ATOM/CMDX, ATOM/LUM, ATOM/NGM, ATOM/IOV\n From higher swap fees in Multihop to Identical swap fees: ATOM/IXO, ATOM/DEC, ATOM/CHEQ\n\n For a full comparison of the swap fees by route before and after the change proposed see here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFI4S5wqDoC-WiUbWoLJ0dRbylqbvQ1ZTjpiN71lkGA\n\nFurther details and discussion: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4340-reduce-osmoatom-pool-swap-fee-to-02",0

Match external incentives provided by the BitSong team for BTSG/OSMO (pool 573), BTSG/ATOM (pool 574) and BTSG/UST (pool 592). External incentives have already begun and will continue for 30 epochs.

By voting YES on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will be matched at ~$12,500 per day, at the current value of $0,25 x BTSG
By voting NO on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will NOT be matched at ~$12,500 per day, at the current value of $0,25 x BTSG

**Context**
The BitSong team has provided a first batch of 1,500,000 BTSG across BTSG/OSMO pool 573, BTSG/ATOM pool 574 and BTSG/UST pool 592, amounting to ~$375,000, at the current value of $0,25 x BTSG, over the course of 30 epochs beginning Tuesday, November 30th at 00:00am UTC.

The $BTSG incentives are as follows:

BTSG/OSMO (Pool #573): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$4.166,66 at the current value of $0,25 x BTSG
BTSG/ATOM (Pool #574): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$4.166,66 at the current value of $0,25 x BTSG
BTSG/UST (Pool #592): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$4.166,66 at the current value of $0,25 x BTSG
Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$12,500 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/54, these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.",0
218,"Increase Max Rate of Incentive Adjustment from 20% to 25% (Round 3)

Problem Statement \n\n The Adjust Scale parameter of used to dampen volatility in the weekly incentives adjustments algorithm is too low.  Pools are hitting this cap and either not having incentives drained or added quickly enough to reward the liquidity the market is valuing the most.\n\n This could be detrimental to TVL growth as existing liquidity can become over incentivized while newer liquidity, more valued by the market, struggles to attain justified reward allocations.\n\n Experimental Problem Solution\n\n Incrementally increase the Adjust Scale parameter then monitor how frequently pools continue hitting the cap and assess if further increase proposals are warranted.  The hypothesis is that this variable should be turned up to probably 25% but in multiple phases to allow for observation of the impacts.\n\n Proposal \n\n By voting YES on this proposal you signal approval to increase the Adjust Scale variable +5% (20% to 25%) \n\n By voting NO on this proposal you signal dissent and want the Adjust Scale variable to remain at 20% \n\n Commonwealth Discussion \n\n https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/2802-increasing-weekly-adjustment-rate \n\n Adjust Scaling CAP Model \n\n https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G-UGlzyJHuHFqdmGPxiE6hHVscBDtxOFZVMFPo5lTsc \n\n Showing pools that have too high incentives that are reducing too slowly (Blue), too low incentives that are increasing too slowly (Green) and that the scaling does not apply to due to low maturity (Grey)",0
219,"Upload SwapRouter Contract

Passing this proposal will upload the SwapRouter contract to the Osmosis chain.\n\n## Details\nThe SwapRouter contract serves as a way to define, on-chain, routes that swaps from one asset to another will take. \n\nThis is important as there may exist multiple pools that are available for each potential swap with differing:\n* Fees (including Multihop discount routes)\n* Curves (e.g. Balancer vs StableSwap)\n* Liquidity depths (Two deeper pools vs one shallow pool)\n* Liquidity types (AMM vs Concentrated Liquidity)\n\nThe contract has an owner that can update default routes which is initially set to governance. However, the contract can be freely instantiated and routes may then be set on each copy for third party usage.\n\nThis proposal will upload the SwapRouter contract to the Osmosis platform. This will allow the contract to be instantiated and begin performing its intended functions.\n\n## Git Commit ID\n[https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/commit/beee069b93bb2275e49ae01808a4d44c16f85401](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/commit/beee069b93bb2275e49ae01808a4d44c16f85401)\n\n## Version of Compiler used\ncosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.10\n\n## Checksum\nswaprouter.wasm\na3cf2debef3855cae869dfeae4635e4dead415f1d8a985186e298e155483b336\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9419-proposal-upload-swaprouter-contract](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9419-proposal-upload-swaprouter-contract)",0

228,"Match CMDX External Incentives for Pools 600 and 601

Background
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

** Proposal Details** 
Match external incentives provided by the Comdex team for CMDX/ATOM (pool 600) and CMDX/OSMO (pool 601). External incentives have already begun and will continue for 90 epochs.
- By voting YES on this proposal, external CMDX incentives will be matched at ~$72,000 per day
- By voting NO on this proposal, external CMDX incentives will NOT be matched at ~$72,000 per day

** Context **
The Comdex team has provided 3,000,000 CMDX across CMDX/ATOM pool 600 and CMDX/OSMO pool 601 amounting to ~$6,500,000 over the course of 90 epochs beginning Wednesday, December 8th and 12:00 UTC.

The CMDX incentives are as follows:
- CMDX/ATOM (Pool #600): ~16667 CMDX per day amounting to ~$36,000
- CMDX/OSMO (Pool #601): ~16667 CMDX per day amounting to ~$36,000

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$72,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/54, these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.

232,"Incentives - Repo Process and Category Model

n\n[Link to commonwealth post](https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4722-incentives-repo-process-and-category-model)\n\nThis proposal entails two sub proposals.\n\n1. That we overhaul the meta process for generation of adjustment proposals. This has historically been implemented through a series of google spreadsheets implementing each variant of the mechanism, with static copies made for the generation of each proposal. This shall be replaced with a Github repository based process, which will make public tracking of changes easier, and allow for (nearly) full automation of the proposal generation process.\n\n2. That we modify the current mechanism (bias, subsidy, matching, fee cap, etc) to first group pools into categories, each with a parameterized incentive share, and then pools within each category split that share based on their share of fees collected and external incentives.\n\n\n## Github Repository\n\n[link to repo](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives/tree/unity/mainnet)\n\nThis Github repo will at all times contain at least 3 branches, which (along with some Github Action workflows), serve to automate the process of creating weekly adjustment proposals.\n\nThe `main` branch contains the process and data for the most recent proposal.\n\nThe `staging` branch contains the process for the next proposal.\n\nThroughout the week, PRs are made to `staging` corresponding to on chain text proposals, such as adding pools to onboarding, matching external incentives, or changing the adjustment process.\n\nA `liveview` branch off of staging is continually updated with new data, so that we can see what we expect the next proposal to look like.\n\nAs on chain text proposals pass, their PRs are merged to `staging` (and then merged to the `liveview` branch on the next update).\n\nWhen it is time for a new adjustment proposal, the `liveview` branch is merged back into `staging` (giving it up to date market data). And then `staging` branch is merged into `main`.\n\nThe data in the `main` branch is then used to create the on chain adjustment proposal.\n\n\n\n## Category Model\n\nThis model groups pools into a number of categories with proportional incentive shares, so that we can prioritize certain classes of liquidity directly.\n\n### Target Share\nThe share of incentives allocated to each category is then split according to the proportion of swap fees collected by each pool within the category. These values are limited by the `swap fee cap` (currently 3), such that pools will not benefit by having more than 3x the average fee APR of the category.\n\nWe then recalculate shares using (capped) fees + external incentives collected by the pool. To limit the incentive increase caused by a match relative to the base incentives, we take the minimum of this `adjusted reveneue` share, and `(1 + matched_multiple_cap) * capped_fee_share`. We set `matched_multiple_cap` at 1, so set matches to be no more than the base incentives of a pool.\n\n### Major\n\nQualification for `Major` status is determined by governance based on a combination of factors, namely:\n- Is the token market cap large relative to `Osmo`\n- Does the majority of the trade volume happen outside of Osmosis\n- Do we have a strategic interest in attracting more liquidity of this token\n\nThis proposal also entails choosing `ATOM`, `WETH`, `WBTC` and `CRO` as starting `Major` tokens. As well as `USDC`, `DAI`, and `EEUR` as stablecoins.\n\n### Minimum Share\nPools can also have a minimum share set by governance, to incentivize liquidity ahead of observed trading volume. We set minimums of 25% of incentives on pools 1 and 5% on pools 674, 704, and 712 as demonstration and to guarantee a large amount of incentives for base liquidity. These parameters would be set and changed by governance and should be used to prioritize the growth of strategic liquidity.\n### Categories\n\nThese initial category shares were chosen to approximately match the current breakdown of incentives between these groupings, but should be changed over time with follow up text proposals as needed. (And will likely be adjusted along with proposals to add incentives to new pools in the category)\n\n- Osmo/Major - 45%\n- Osmo/Stable - 30%\n- Osmo/Minor - 20%\n- Stable/Major - 0%\n- Stable/Stable - 0%\n- Others - 5% - Liquidity for Minor tokens paired with non-Osmo\n\n",0
233,"Senate candidate: VANESSA HARRIS


VANESSA HARRIS is running for a position on the new Kujira Senate. Use this proposal as an opportunity to signal whether you'd like to see them as a member of The Senate, or not.

The final Senate will be made up of no more than 9 members, however you should vote for as many or as few
candidates as you'd like to see represent the comminity. The top 9 by total yes votes will instantiate the first version of The Senate.

## Bio

Vanessa is an experienced Product Leader with more than 20 years founding and leading products at Google and Microsoft. For the last two years she has led products in Web3 digital identity and DeFi for a number of Web3 startups. She is also an advisor to three Web3 projects: Kavarii, a decentralized video streaming service built on MultiversX; Valorize DAO, a suite of tools for DAOs on the Ethereum network; and a stealth NFT project launching on Ethereum in early 2023.

## Related Experience

Vanessa has broad DeFi experience across a number of crypto ecosystems including Cosmos, Luna, Cardano, MultiversX, Polygon, Ethereum and of course Kujira. She brings a familiarity with algorithmic stablecoins, automated market makers, crypto onramps and offramps, decentralized lending and borrowing, and token launchpads. Much of her experience has been shared through her Youtube Channel, Just Crypto, as well as on Twitter. She is also proficient in the crucial crypto skill of meme making.  

## Personal Statement

Crypto is important because it allows for true ownership, transactions without a trusted intermediary, anonymity, transparent verification, equal access, freedom from government control and sound, predictable money. We're on the cusp of creating a new financial system that is more fair, more accessible. Yet we are beset on every side with centralized ponzi schemes, cash grabs disguised as businesses and DeFi reliant on inflationary tokenomics to survive. A decentralized economy needs decentralized money. It also needs to grow up. Kujira brings grown up DeFi and grown up governance to the Web3 economy. The Kujira team has shown resilience through the greatest of storms and is building at a rapid pace with a best in class user experience. Most importantly they displayed strength of character in offering KUJI holders one for one redemption on the new Kujira blockchain after Luna collapsed. I believe my skills, experience and passion can help Kujira bring grown up DeFi to the Cosmos and beyond. I would be honored if you would consider me for the position of Senator.

235,"Signalling Proposal for Initial IBC Rate Limits

This proposal signals the implementation of initial rate-limiting criteria for net movements as specified below. These will be implemented in a future software upgrade.\n\n## IBC Rate Limiting Background\nThe IBC Rate Limit module is a safety control implemented in v13, intended to protect assets on Osmosis in the event of security issues with:\n* Osmosis\n* A counter-party chain\n* IBC\n\nRate limits allow only a specified net percentage change in the quantity of an asset on Osmosis within a specified time period.\n\nThis slows down the rate of any security incidents, allowing validators more time to respond, investigate and take any action required. Either capping the rate at which exploited tokens generated elsewhere can be sent to Osmosis for disposal or preventing unusually high amounts of tokens on Osmosis being removed.\n\n## Proposed Values\nAs starting values this proposal will set the following for the largest assets, accounting for approximately 90% of all TVL on chain:\n\nAll Assets to be set to 30% in, 30% out within 24 hours and 60% in, 60% out within 7 days.\n\nATOM - ibc/27394FB092D2ECCD56123C74F36E4C1F926001CEADA9CA97EA622B25F41E5EB2\nUSDC - ibc/D189335C6E4A68B513C10AB227BF1C1D38C746766278BA3EEB4FB14124F1D858\nWBTC - ibc/D1542AA8762DB13087D8364F3EA6509FD6F009A34F00426AF9E4F9FA85CBBF1F\nWETH - ibc/EA1D43981D5C9A1C4AAEA9C23BB1D4FA126BA9BC7020A25E0AE4AA841EA25DC5\nEVMOS - ibc/6AE98883D4D5D5FF9E50D7130F1305DA2FFA0C652D1DD9C123657C6B4EB2DF8A\nSTARS - ibc/987C17B11ABC2B20019178ACE62929FE9840202CE79498E29FE8E5CB02B7C0A4\nDAI - ibc/0CD3A0285E1341859B5E86B6AB7682F023D03E97607CCC1DC95706411D866DF7\nJUNO - ibc/46B44899322F3CD854D2D46DEEF881958467CDD4B3B10086DA49296BBED94BED\nCRO - ibc/E6931F78057F7CC5DA0FD6CEF82FF39373A6E0452BF1FD76910B93292CF356C1\n\n[Proposed Values Table](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a9fa2426-3aa9-4560-95bb-92e11cd9afca.1676287310343)\n\n## Justification\nLiquid staking assets are not included in this proposal as spikes in movement would occur in the event of a depeg event to stabilise the peg.\n\nThe 24 hour period was chosen in order to give validators across time zones a chance to act on any questionable behavious detected while resetting frequently enough that extreme market conditions are able to be reflected on Osmosis.\n\nThe 7 day backup period was chosen in case the 24 hour period was not sufficient for validator action to occur.\n\nLimits set should be well outside peak usage and so not affect users using the exchange normally.\n\nToken variance day by day since launch shows that the greatest variance by far happened during May 2022.\n[Token Variance](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/16f14ce2-393a-41dd-95f3-17f7f8af26a1.1671358883648)\n\nConfining this chart to the May and June 2022 period, which covers the UST depeg event as well as the v9 chain halt, shows that most variance was caused by newly listed and incentivised Axelar and Evmos tokens gathering liquidity.\n[Terra Depeg and Chain Halt Token Variance](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bbcc5f16-68be-41ce-84b1-b16701c8bfe1.1671358893512)\n\nExamining the Negative axis only - the impact of the USDT depeg and the funds temporarily lost during the v9 exploit can be seen. The proposed rate limits would have been triggered on alternative stablecoins during the Terra depeg event and prevented the v9 exploit from getting worse in the event that it had not been caught as quickly as it was.\n[Terra Depeg and Chain Halt Token Variance, Negative Only](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/5fa80c86-b985-4837-b2ae-490ffcd70b1e.1671358903066)\n\nExcluding freshly launched tokens from the picture also gives a view that net change reduces the longer a token has been listed. This may correlate to deeper liquidity but shows that these rate limits should be only implemented on high liquidity, established tokens, as well as being regularly reviewed.

Distribution of 13,750,000 GRAV tokens currently in the Osmosis community pool with the following amounts for a period of **120 days:**

* WETH.grv/OSMO - 4,000,000 GRAV - Pool #634 
* USDC.grv/OSMO – 3,750,000 GRAV - Pool #633 
* USDT.grv/OSMO – 5,000,000 GRAV – Pool #818 
* GRAV/OSMO – 1,000,000 GRAV - Pool #625 

The distribution of these tokens will be handled by a 3/4 multi-sig composed of Johnny Wyles, luisqa from Osmosis community and Paul | SkyNet Validators and Dan | Qwoyn Validator representing the Gravity community.

These pools currently are the second and third largest OSMO pools on Osmosis by Total Value Locked.\n At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~11 million OSMO from these pools to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the ~15 million OSMO from the initial OSMO/ATOM pool.\n\n UST is a stablecoin that tracks the price of the US Dollar. Users mint new UST by burning LUNA. \n\n LUNA is the Terra protocol’s native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra Stablecoins. LUNA is used for governance and in mining. Users stake LUNA to validators who record and verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees.

Pools are hitting this cap and either not having incentives drained or added quickly enough to reward the liquidity the market is valuing the most.\n\nThis could be detrimental to TVL growth as existing liquidity can become over incentivized while newer liquidity, more valued by the market, struggles to attain justified reward allocations.\n\n\n*****Experimental Problem Solution*****\n\nIncrementally increase the Adjust Scale parameter then monitor how frequently pools continue hitting the cap and assess if further increase proposals are warranted.  The hypothesis is that this variable should be turned up to probably 25% but in multiple phases to allow for observation of the impacts.\n\n\n*****Proposal*****\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal you signal approval to increase the Adjust Scale variable +5% (15% to 20%)\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal you signal dissent and want the Adjust Scale variable to remain at 15%\n\n\n*****Commonwealth Discussion*****\nhttps://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/2802-increasing-weekly-adjustment-rate\n\n\n*****Adjust Scaling CAP Model*****\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G-UGlzyJHuHFqdmGPxiE6hHVscBDtxOFZVMFPo5lTsc\n\nShowing pools that have too high incentives that are reducing too slowly (Blue), too low incentives that are increasing too slowly (Green) and that the scaling does not apply to due to low maturity (Grey)",0

266,"Creation of the Grow Juno SubDAO

# Grow Juno SubDAO\n\nThe Juno community's Terra Developer Fund has achieved its purpose. Since the passing of the Terra Developer Fund Proposal, 18 projects have pulled themselves from the wreckage of the Terra collapse and found a new home on Juno. In this process of delivering aid to Terra projects, we noticed that Terra developers aren't the only ones who could use a little help. There are many new projects building on Juno, or who wish to build on Juno, that could benefit from community support.\n\nThe rapid ascent of projects on Juno has been fantastic, but in an increasingly competitive landscape, we must maintain this momentum and drive growth sustainably for the long term. We can now do this with the Growth Fund, one led by community members, operated transparently, and owned by Juno governance. We now have the time and opportunity to build up the ideal form of this DAO. We must have more human resources, diverse views, and representatives from the community - as well as a means to collaborate with outside capital partners to participate alongside the Juno Community in funding these protocols. The projects built in this bear market will define Juno's future as a leader in the Cosmos, a home for projects and protocols, and a community-driven incubator for the CosmWasm interchain.\n\nThis proposal would transition the Terra Developer Fund into an official Grow Juno SubDAO. This proposal aims to expand the membership to include members from the community with professional investing experience, analyst skill sets and valuable business acumen. As a community initiative, we are purposefully aiming to have less representation from Core-1, and stronger representation from experts within the community.\n\nThis proposal will expand upon Proposal 23 by extending the scope beyond Terra migrations to include all new projects and investments conducive to the growth and development of Juno, to bring more value to Juno holders as a whole, as well as new investment opportunities which expand the Juno's Community Pool and make it a sustainable resource for continued growth and community endeavors. \n\nThe [Terra Developer Fund Treasury](https://legacy.daodao.zone/multisig/juno1lgnstas4ruflg0eta394y8epq67s4rzhg5anssz3rc5zwvjmmvcql6qps2) will be transferred to the Grow Juno SubDAO and will seed the initial SubDAO treasury.\n\n## Creation of SubDAO\n\nIf passed, an official SubDAO will be created so that the Juno community maintains control of the SubDAO itself, and its associated treasury.\n\nAt the time of Prop 23 passing, the DAODAO SubDAO system was not available. Now that it is available, it is a much better setup than a normal multisig and with DAODAO V2 on the way, this will only make SubDAOs more effective.\n\n**Some key benefits are:**\n\n- Community control of SubDAO membership.\n- Community control of SubDAO treasury.\n- Formalization of the purpose of this SubDAO: To grow the overall ecosystem and bring in new capital.\n- Control from the community to return funds to the Community Pool, if it deems necessary.\n- Control from the community to add or remove members and the entire SubDAO, if it deems necessary.\n\n**Specific mandates:**\n\n1) The Grow Juno SubDAO will seek community approval (through on-chain signaling proposal) for any grants above k to any single entity.\n\n2) The Grow Juno SubDAO will actively seek out projects and investments which can contribute strong token swaps and/or obvious profits to the Community Pool, and will always aim to take actions which maintain the sustainability of the fund for the Juno community. In some cases, public goods may be funded, subject to the same limitations as above, insofar as they unlock key functionality for promising new protocols, (i.e. oracles, infrastructure partners, indexing, protocol code audits, etc)\n\n3) The Grow Juno SubDAO Treasury is subject to the control of the entire community. The community has the ability to cancel any outstanding funding and/or return funds to the community pool, at any time through governance, for any reason.\n\n4) The Grow Juno SubDAO membership will be established by governance, and will be maintained and changed using DAO voting, as necessary to accommodate and adjust its membership to the needs of the Juno Community. At any time, on-chain governance can override membership, as with all SubDAOs.\n\n5) As the membership is expanding, it's important to mandate that, where notable conflicts of interest may occur, members are expected to vote to abstain and recuse themselves. Simply being an investor in a project shall not be deemed to be a conflict of interest.\n\n6) The Grow Juno SubDAO will encourage and assist protocols in seeking additional supplementary funding with outside capital and funding partners to lower the risk of funding issuance by the Juno community, and will help to bring in new capital to the ecosystem through venture partners.\n\n7) Being an investor in projects is encouraged, and many of the venture investors working alongside the DAO can and should take on the risk of investing in protocols coming into the ecosystem. This must be encouraged to spread risk/benefit amongst numerous entities, and not place the burden of protocol funding solely upon the Juno community. Investments shall be disclosed by members publicly.\n\n8) Members of the DAO should be paid modestly while proving their own continued effectiveness and the viability of the subDAO, but well enough to put in the hours required to achieve the goals of the subDAO. This will be implemented sustainably by staking a portion of the treasury so that funding is not depleted over time.\n\n9) These mandates can be changed only through SubDAO membership voting on DAODAO, in a manner fully visible to the Juno community.\n\n**The membership of this SubDAO is proposed to be as such:**\n\n6 of 11 required for funding approval\n\n- Kevin Garrison (Oni Validator + Juno Biz Dev)\n- Maxjuno (Community Outreach + DAO Coordination)\n- Pupmos (Technical Expertise, Validator)\n- GoldenRatioStaking (Contracts Negotiations, Real Estate Investor)\n- Rarma (Project Manager, Quality Assurance, Vetting)\n- Jonathan DeLine (Venture Experience, M&A, Advisor)\n- Wtrsld (NetaDAO + Venture Experience)\n- Avicenna - Kleomedes (Validator, Fund Experience, Yield Expert, Analytics)\n- BoringDAO Members (Cosmos Investment DAO: Rahul P., Jonathan K., Connor K., RJ Patel)\n- Jonathan Caras, (VC, Protocol Outreach, Project Specialist, Comms)\n- Matthew Cantieri (VC, Microsoft VC, Protocol Incubation)\n\n**Advisory Board to the subDAO:**\nThese are advisors to the subDAO, who have valuable insights and skills and will also serve as a pool of potential DAO members who can step in to take up a voting seat, when needed.\n\n- _BitN8 (Project Specialist, Vetting)_\n- _JaparJam (Web3 Builders Alliance, Developer Resources)_\n- _CamelJuno (Full Stack Dev, UI/UX/DX, C2 Contributor)_\n- _Soi2studios (Community + Investor)_\n- _Reece, Validator & Technical Expert - NotionalDAO_\n- _TendermintTimmy, (SparkIBC, Community Validator)_\n- _Joe Abbey (Community Validator, Technical Expert)_\n- _Highlander Nodes (Validator, C2 Contributor)_\n- _Gjermund Garaba (EmpowerChain, Dev, Validator)_\n- _CommunityStaking (Community Validator)_\n- _DelRey - Stakin (Community Validator)_\n\n### Verifying the SubDAO Instantiation Message\nInformation on verifying and understanding the SubDAO Instantiation message and how it works can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/JakeHartnell/95492da2508074e44b8e5cef01aebc5f).\n\n## Vote:\n\nBy voting **YES**, you agree the Grow Juno SubDAO should be created as per the above proposal.\n\nBy Voting **NO**, it means you do not believe the Grow Juno SubDAO should be created as per the above proposal.\n\nBy voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\nVoting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.\n",0

279,"Fund incentives for the Interchain Security Incentivized testnet – Game of Chains – from the Community Pool

## Summary
This community pool spend proposal seeks approval to fund **20K ATOM** worth of incentives for the incentivized Interchain Security testnet – Game of Chains – coming to the Cosmos Hub, expected in November 2022.
## Background
Interchain Security (ICS) is a Cosmos SDK capability that has captured the mindshare of the Cosmos Ecosystem for well over the last year. This has been reflected in the engineering efforts by various core entities including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems as well as initial users Quicksilver and Neutron. ICS allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain.
ICS is a complex technology that needs to be rigorously tested. To ensure successful rollout, we are launching an incentivized public testnet where Cosmos Hub validators can participate and build confidence around this technology. Game of Chains will build on the Cosmos Hub’s legacy of running successful adversarial testnet programs in the past including [Game of Zones](https://github.com/cosmosdevs/GameOfZones) and [Game of Stakes](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/).
We believe the community will see ICS as a valuable addition to Cosmos Hub for three core reasons. First, it allows for “hub minimalism.” By deploying features on a consumer chain instead of Cosmos Hub, we keep the hub lightweight and reduce the surface area for attacks and vulnerabilities. Second, Interchain Security lowers the barrier for ATOM aligned app chains to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Instead of arranging their own validator set, new app chains can utilize the Cosmos Hub’s existing validator for security. And lastly, Interchain Security accrues value to ATOM and enhances its utility. As new Interchain Secured zones launch, gas fees on these new chains flow back to ATOM stakers through the Hub’s validators.
## Incentivized Testnet
For a successful launch, validators will need to prepare and train for expanding their node operations and governance efforts for every new Interchain Secured chain starting up. We are proposing an incentivized public testnet program that will serve the dual purposes of (1) testing Interchain Security in mainnet-like conditions and (2) providing Cosmos Hub validators the opportunity to build confidence around running the Interchain Security protocol.
In order to prevent delays and adequately prepare for launch, we believe it is critical for all Cosmos Hub validators to participate in this public testnet. For this reason, we’re seeking community approval for 20K ATOM (approximately USD 300k) withdrawn for the community pool to reward validators participating in the Cosmos Hub testnet.
* From this prize pool, 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for Cosmos Hub validators who complete Interchain Security testnet milestones. These milestones will be published at the launch of the testnet.
* The remaining 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for bonuses to validators who help identify bugs or performance issues or help develop new tools and monitoring solutions at the discretion of the jury
* Funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig committee
* Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool

## Governance votes
The following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:
**YES** - You approve this community spend proposal to fund the interchain security testnet incentives that will be managed by a multisig
**NO** - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form (please indicate why in the Cosmos Forum).
**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.
**ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.",0
280,"Governance Split Votes

In the Cosmos Hub governance system, each address can only cast a vote for one option (Yes/No/Abstain/NoWithVeto) which uses their full voting power behind that choice.

This proposal proposes an upgrade to the Cosmos Hub governance module that would allow a staker to optionally split their votes into several voting options. For example, a single address could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No. Clients may opt into supporting this feature, as the existing UX of voting for a single option is preserved.

This is beneficial because oftentimes the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company or organization that owns an address might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power.

Another example use case is exchanges and custodians. Many custodians and exchanges custody multiple customers’ ATOMs in the same address and use this address to stake on behalf of them. However, because of this, it makes it infeasible to do 'passthrough voting' and give their customers voting rights over their tokens, if different customers have different voting preferences. With this new proposal, custodians can use split votes to accurately reflect the preferences of their customers in on-chain governance.

The technical architecture for this feature can be seen in ADR 037 to the Cosmos SDK: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-037-gov-split-vote.md 

Acceptance of this governance proposal is signalling approval to adopt this feature in a future upgrade of the Cosmos Hub.",0

In turn, this will let users transfer  from bostrom, and to transfer  from cosmoshub back to bostrom.\n\nBy voting **YES**, the Cosmoshub stakers, voice their support to unfreeze IBC channel-240 between Cosmoshub and Bostrom.\n\nBy voting **NO**, the Cosmoshub stakers voice their dissent to unfreeze IBC channel-240 between Cosmoshub and Bostrom network.\n\n**Details:**\n\nMost IBC connections between Bostrom and other Cosmos chains have been relayed, to a large extent, only by the Bro_n_Bro validator.\n\nOriginally, channel-240 was created with a very short trusting period of 2 days. Alas, the lack of monitoring from our side caused the expiration of client 07-tendermint-497, which in turn, led to the impossibility to transfer tokens using channel-240. Currently, there are around 710 ATOM stuck on the bostrom chain, belonging to about 20 different accounts.\n\nAs this might be the first case, when a channel renewal on cosmoshub-4, happens via a governance proposal, we have set up prior testing to ensure that everything will work smoothly. We also modified test-suite https://github.com/bro-n-bro/ibc-testbed (thanks to the Lum devs for the awesome repo), so everyone could simulate the client renewal using governance with this test suite.\n\nIn the case that this proposal goes through, client 07-tendermint-497 state will be substituted by the state of client 07-tendermint-643.\nAlso if passed - channels 240-5 (cosmoshub-4 - bostrom) would be used, only, to recover the stuck funds. New channels would be created with a longer trusting period to ensure further stability.\n\nWe will be happy to answer any questions at our [Telegram community group](https://t.me/bro_n_bro_community) or on our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/868962876721860638/870738846772514826).",0

301,"Match External Incentives for SCRT/ATOM and SCRT/OSMO pairs

**Background**
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47, the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

**Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the Secret Network community for the SCRT/ATOM and SCRT/OSMO pairs. 

-   By voting **YES** on this proposal, external SCRT incentives will be matched at ~$10,000 per day
-   By voting **NO** on this proposal, external SCRT incentives will NOT be matched at ~$10,000 per day

**Context**
The proposal for the external incentives went live on the Secret Network on November 20th, 2021 and is passing with unanimous approval: https://wallet.keplr.app/#/secret/governance?detailId=64. The discussion around the incentives can be seen here: https://forum.scrt.network/t/proposal-scrt-on-osmosis-early-pool-incentives-to-mitigate-slippage-and-boost-liquidity/4737. This proposal is for ~$5000 per day in SCRT distributed across both pairs, however if the Osmosis community chooses to match, SCRT Labs will make the SCRT incentive ~$10,000 per day.

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$10,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54, these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.

304,"Continued reduction of emissions to Liquidity Pools

* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates approval that 20% of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives should be redirected to the community pool to lower direct Osmosis inflation until governance returns it.\n\n* Voting No for this proposal indicates that 1% shall continue to be the proportion of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives that is redirected to the community pool.\n\n### Background \nOsmosis has been providing only 80% of the 45% (36%) of emissions to Liquidity Pools since Proposal 230.\nThese have now returned to the liquidity incentives as stated in the original proposal.\n\nSince Proposal 230, Osmosis has continued to attract liquidity in major tokens despite these lowered incentives.  This is hard to see at first glance due to the market conditions but becomes much more obvious when viewing liquidity in terms of token amounts rather than value locked.\n\n[WETH Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/839d69c5-aa82-4ede-a02c-d43711abde7f.1656416646064)\n[WBTC Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/8e602367-a368-49a4-a127-aa81b4586ad0.1656416653281)\n[ATOM Token Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fcd8f808-8161-4616-b66a-2536514f0ead.1656416664670)\n[USDC Liquidity](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/053acb34-3552-4275-af7e-3d46f25c5585.1656416675731)\nATOM and USDC liquidity have been hit during this period by being an offramp for Terra and part of the loss due to exploited funds but have not seen a significant change in rate of growth due to the incentive spend change.\n\nThis raises the question of how much we are overpaying liquidity providers to bring their liquidity to Osmosis.  This overpayment contributes to the inflation of the Osmosis token and, if it is not required, then these tokens could be used either during the next hype period to attract new users, to pay for more teams to develop additional utilities for the Osmosis ecosystem or be used to provide incentives to other protocols building on Osmosis.\n\nIn the following model, we can see the estimated APR that a user would obtain if they were to stake the two separate halves of the liquidity pool on their own networks and how that compares with providing liquidity.  Where there is no alternative staking reward then OSMO staking APR is used as a substitute.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1irSsCJbC7uGal8I5Eb0l2M2p6M7S20aUUkgfamK_zyg/edit?usp=sharing\nThe estimated overspend by Osmosis LP incentives compared to these staking rewards is around 37%.\n\nSome overspending is sensible to attract OSMO compounding in the Major/Osmo category pools where Osmosis would like to build liquidity to gain market share.  However the overspending is not only directly contributing to the inflation of the OSMO token, it may also be increasing the sell pressure on tokens such as ATOM, where the optimal use of staking rewards is currently to sell single sided into Pool 1 rather than re-stake.\n\nThis proposal initially asks for the funds originally removed for Terra Pools to resume redirection to the community pool for the foreseeable future.  If this is successful and the rate of token liquidity change continues then further proposals will be made to reduce emissions to liquidity pools even further whilst still remaining the primary liquidity mining location in the IBC.\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5779-continued-reduction-of-emissions-to-liquidity-pools-during-the-bear-market",0

307,"Remove Incentives from all Terra pools

Voting YES for this proposal indicates that OSMO incentives should be removed from all Terra related pools and the fixed daily OSMO emissions reallocated to all other Incentivized pools. \n\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that OSMO incentives on Terra pools will remain, and incentives naturally drain over time. \n\n Background \n Due to the hyperinflation of LUNA supply caused by the recent UST depeg event, LUNA pools receive a far higher share of incentives than they should according to the current incentive model. \n UST incentives will likely also excessive once the hard fork allows unpooling and liquidity falls, as well as when the first people unbonding begin to sell their UST into the pool. \n As Osmosis incentives cannot be adjusted by more than 25% a week due to the Scaling Cap setting, the incentives on these pools may remain high for several months. This results in Osmosis paying for liquidity in these pools which is, at best, a highly speculative purchase based on any potential recovery model. At worst, users will buy in to obtain a high APR and be used as exit liquidity for people who have unbonded early. \n While the existing incentives do compensate for Impermanent Loss to some extent, they do not differentiate between users who suffered this and users who bought in since. If this proposal passes, liquidity providers will have obtained 11 days of incentives since the crash.\n The Osmosis emissions taken from the Terra pools will be distributed proportionately to all incentivised pools, giving all pools a boost of around a third of their APR\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4878-urgent-remove-all-terra-related-incentives",0

313,"Proposal for removing OSMO incentives on JUNO / XKI pool

By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:
Removing OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:
Removing OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

The following proposal is a special signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to remove XKI/JUNO pair into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.
Regular XKI/JUNO pool have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.
A proposal for JUNO incentives that would be matched by XKI incentives has been posted and rejected by the Juno community as it happened to be more controversial than expected: https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/7.

In order to remain fair to the OSMOSIS community, the Ki Foundation offers to support the removal of OSMO incentives from the JUNO / XKI pools as it has been stated on the live with Cryptocito: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=leY7R217qss.

This proposal has for sole goal to keep a spirit of fairness towards the Osmosis community, as we will continue building products on the Juno chain and continue our support on making the Cosmos ecosystem a more interoperable space!

318,"Add functionality to allow depooling of UST pools via emergency upgrade hard fork in proposal #225

Add functionality to allow depooling via emergency upgrade hard fork in proposal #225\n \n Because UST is IBC-native and because bridges to other stablecoins have just now going up, UST has been the predominant stablecoin on Osmosis. UST LP providers thought they were LP'ing with a stablecoin, and now they are facing significant further depeg risk. This proposal seeks to mitigate the IL loss due to the rapid depeg.\n \n UST pools have had unforeseen volatility and due to sigificant full depeg risk, Osmosis users should have a chance to avoid further potential impermanent loss. This proposal gives liquidity providers in these pools the option to take an action to unpool their liquidity in these UST pools if they wish. Unpooling would be a new message action an LP can take on these pools if they were bonded before the emergency proposal time. Unpooling on a 14 day bond will be the equivalent of exiting the pool, and then beginning a 14 day unlock for the constituent assets. This has the affect of confirming any impermanent loss, and will safeguard one half of their remaining liquidity tokens in the event of an asset in the pair going to zero.\n \n Furthermore, by reducing the liqudity between OSMO and UST, it makes the UST->OSMO->ATOM a less liquid exit liquidity path for UST, helping reduce OSMO price impact during further UST depegs.\n \n Governance should be very cautious with this, as its a significant change to Osmosis and may set a dangerous precedent. The change is concerning on multiple fronts, including the fairness to other LP's, using a hard fork for something thats arguably a market design problem, and what is to be expected in the next crash.\n \n Because this process requires a software upgrade and is extremely time sensitive, we propose adding the execution of this to the same mechanism proposed in proposal #225.  Namely, once 2/3 of *total chain voting power* approves proposal #225, if within a short time period, 2/3 of total chain voting power also approves this proposal, then this signals the approval for validators to include functionality enabling depooling in the emergency hard fork.\n \n The list of pools affected is:\n #560 (UST/OSMO)\n #562 (UST/LUNA)\n #567 (UST/EEUR)\n #578 (UST/XKI)\n #592 (UST/BTSG)\n #610 (UST/CMDX)\n #612 (UST/XPRT)\n #615 (UST/LUM)\n #642 (UST/UMEE)\n #679 (4Pool)\n \n Note: This Proposal will consider to be passed based on 67\% of governance voting Yes and failed based on 33\% voting No and so will be eligible for action when this threshold has passed rather than at the end of the voting period.",0

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/EVMOS (#722) pool on Osmosis.\n\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/EVMOS (#722) pool on Osmosis.\n\n**Details**\nThis proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/EVMOS pool (#722). This pool is currently the twelfth largest OSMO pool on Osmosis by Total Value Locked containing around 1.01% of all OSMO liquidity.\nAt the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~436 thousand OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the ~40 million OSMO from the currently enabled pools.\nThis proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance.\n\nEvmos is bringing the world of Ethereum-based applications and assets to the interoperable networks of the Cosmos ecosystem, all while aligning developer and user incentives.

321,"Osmosis v12 Oxygen Upgrade

## Osmosis v12 Oxygen Upgrade\n\nThis is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v12.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 6246000, which is estimated to occur on **Friday September 30th, UTC 16:00**. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.\n\n## Upgrade Features\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n\n### TWAP\n\n* Time weighted average prices for all AMM pools have been implemented. \n* These expose an on-chain oracle for each pool allowing CosmWasm apps to use this data.\n\n### CosmWasm contract developer features\n\n* Enables select queries for cosmwasm contracts.\n* Adds message responses to gamm messages, to remove the neccessity of bindings.\n* Allow specifying denom metadata from tokenfactory.\n* Upgrade to wasmd v0.28.0\n\n### Interchain Accounts Enabled\n\nAllows accounts on another ICA enabled chain to carry out transactions on Osmosis and vice versa.\n\n### Expedited Proposals\n\nAllows governance to have proposals that execute in faster time windows given higher quorums (2/3rds).\n\n[Full Change Log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/v12.x/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Getting Prepared for the Upgrade\n\nAs always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.\n\nIf using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v12/bin/.\n\nIf not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v12.0.0 binary.\n\n\n## Details of Upgrade Time\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be **6246000**, anticipated to be on **Friday September 30th, UTC 16:00**. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown [here](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/6246000).\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.",0

323,"Reallocate Incentives Removed From Terra Pools To Community Pool

* Voting YES for this proposal indicates agreement for allocating the majority of the OSMO incentives that were removed from Terra pools in prop 227 to the Community Pool.\n\n * Voting NO for this proposal indicates that another plan should be formed for the distribution of the removed OSMO incentives.\n\n This proposal suggests temporarily directing the majority of the incentives removed from Terra pools in proposal 227 to the Osmosis Community Pool.\n Note that this does not include the initial batch of incentives shifted from Terra pools towards ETH, USDC, and DAI pools in proposal 225 but rather the remaining Terra pool incentives described in proposal 227.\n While these incentives could be used to incentivize further liquidity depth in existing pools, as bearish sentiment around the crypto markets sets in, it is becoming increasingly important to keep the Community Pool well-capitalized to fund community initiatives such as the grants program, protocol owned liquidity and strategic incentives.\n Apart from an overlap period caused by Proposal 227 completing two days before this proposal, the APRs of existing non-Terra pools should not be impacted by this reallocation. The inflationary emissions to the community pool will be returned to normal incentives by the first thirdening (June 19th 2022), which will also ease the step change felt by liquidity providers.\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4903-reallocate-incentives-removed-from-terra-pools-to-community-pool",0

325,"Community consent Cosmos Pay supporting OSMO

# **TL:DR:**\nBitCanna has released a payment plugin for the Cosmos-ecosystem for WooCommerce and Prestashop.\nIn this plugin OSMO is enabled as payment method, offering a possibility for webshops to start accepting OSMO as a means of payment. Community support is vital in our opinion, which is why we want to ask the approval of the Osmosis community to have OSMO enabled in the plugin with this proposal. Besides that, having proposal [#376](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/376) in the back of our minds we are requesting to keep the BCNA/OSMO pool incentivized and listed on the main page of Osmosis.\n* Vote Yes if you are in favor of having OSMO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay and in favor of keeping the pool BCNA/OSMO (#571) incentivized in the OSMO/MINOR category\n* Vote No if you don’t want OSMO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay and/or against keeping the pool BCNA/OSMO (#571) incentivized in the OSMO/MINOR category\n## Details\n### Who is BitCanna?\nBitCanna has been found by and for the cannabis industry. It aims to provide a secure and efficient way for businesses and consumers to transact using blockchain technology to create a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions, enabling fast and secure payments without the need for intermediaries. The platform also includes a range of tools and services for merchants, such as point-of-sale systems and financial management tools. With BitCanna, the cannabis industry can benefit from the advantages of digital currencies, including low transaction fees, global accessibility, and increased security.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.bitcanna.io](https://www.bitcanna.io)\n\n### What is Cosmos Pay?\nCosmos Pay is an open-source plugin developed by BitCanna for the e-commerce. Currently it is live for the platforms WooCommerce and Prestashop. Keplr is integrated, making the user experience to pay as smooth as possible.\nThe plugin offers the possibility to integrate a lot (if not all) Cosmos-SDK based cryptocurrencies and is therefore an addition to the tools the Cosmos ecosystem already has to offer. In the current setup ATOM, OSMO, JUNO and BCNA are supported; with more to come in the (near) future. Find out more [here](https://commerce.bitcanna.io).\n\n### Why this proposal?\nSupport from the community is one of the greatest perks in the Cosmos-ecosystem. Via this route we want to give the Osmosis community a chance to have their say in this and to have a method to express their support of the Osmosis community to have OSMO enabled as a coin in the Cosmos Pay plugin. Similar proposals will be uploaded to the Juno and Cosmos communities to get their support as well.\n\nAlso in combination with proposal [#376](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/376) having passed we would like to request the Osmosis community to keep incentives from the OSMO/MINOR category on the BCNA/OSMO pool [#571](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/571).\n\n### Commonwealth thread:\n[https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/8506-community-consent-cosmos-pay-supporting-osmo](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/8506-community-consent-cosmos-pay-supporting-osmo)",0

From the original [Juno Tokenomics blog post](https://medium.com/@JunoNetwork/jun%C3%B8-tokenomics-and-utility-powering-the-worlds-first-fully-interoperable-smart-contract-ce9f490c4d97):\n\n> Approx 10% of the supply difference was allocated to the core-1 development reserve (multi-sig) address for the funding of core infrastructure development.\n\nCore 1 (also know as Root) has helped make Juno into what it is today, a vibrant community and one of the leading chains in the Cosmos. At the same time, Core 1 has not been perfect. As Juno has grown it has increasingly become important to bring in more community representation and decentralization of responsibilities. Thus, Core 1 must evolve.\n\nThis proposal aims to make Core 1 an official Juno SubDAO, making it's membership an elected position with the potential to remove members that are no longer active, as well as giving the community direct admin ability. The SubDAO shall be funded by transfering the current Core 1 Develoment Reserve tokens to the new Core 1 SubDAO.\n\n## The Future Core-1 SubDAO\n\nCore 1 will continue to carry out its assigned mission of funding and leading development of Juno.\n\nFor ease of transition, existing Core 1 members will also be part of the new SubDAO:\n\n- [Wolf](https://twitter.com/lobojuno)\n- [Dimi](https://twitter.com/dimiandre)\n- [Jake](https://twitter.com/JakeHartnell)\n- [Block](https://twitter.com/CosmosChain)\n- [Jack](https://twitter.com/jackzampolin)\n\nIn addition, two additional individuals Juno's Core contributors will be added:\n\n- [Maxjuno](https://twitter.com/max_maxsolo)\n- [the-frey](https://twitter.com/frey_needlecast)\n\nJuno would not exist without them, and both have spent many sleepless nights in service of this chain.\n\nFuture members may be elected by governance, at any point members may be removed by governance if the community looses confidence in them.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal will create an official Core-1 SubDAO with the individuals listed above as official members.\n\nUpon the passing of this proposal, the existing Core 1 multisig will transfer any liquid funds to the new official SubDAO. The vesting funds remaining in the existing Core 1 Development Fund multisig will be transfered to the Official Core 1 SubDAO in a future software upgrade.\n\n## Verifying the SubDAO Instantiation Message\n\nInformation on verifying and understanding the SubDAO Instantiation message and how it works can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/JakeHartnell/87568813bb2f1d39cd7b35121f1ba60f).

327,"Use Hardfork to Accelerate Proposals #222, #223, and #224

Osmosis Proposals #222, #223, and #224 propose to shift incentives from the OSMO/UST, OSMO/LUNA, and LUNA/UST pools towards the OSMO/USDC, OSMO/ETH, and OSMO/DAI pools. These incentives are crucial to help shift Osmosis liquidity away from Terra-based assets towards Ethereum-based stablecoins and major assets. However, these proposals are normal incentive adjustment proposals that go through the normal 5 day voting process (meaning they won't go into effect for 6 epochs).\n \n Because of the extremely volatile market conditions around Terra, we propose that we accelerate this process by using an 'emergency software upgrade' under special fast-voting rules to allow the incentives to shift faster than the normal 5 day voting period.\n \n The 'fast-voting process' would take the form of being enacted as soon as 2/3 of *total chain voting power* votes Yes on this proposal. At that time, if >2/3 of total voting power has voted Yes on each of #222, #223, and #224, then those proposals will be enabled during the upgrade process.  For example, if and once this proposal receives 66.6% of voting power as Yes, if proposals #222 and #224 have >2/3 voting power, they would both be enacted during the upgrade process.\n \n The process of upgrade would involve a height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary, similar to the v6.0 upgrade. Validators/node operators can change the binary during v7 operations, if the fork is approved. The v8.0 software version will be fully state-compatible with *v8.0* until the divergence block.\n \n No upgrade timeline or software patch should be released until 67% of governance approval has voted yes on this proposal. If so, validators should coordinate to attempt to find a time that suffices for this upgrade. (And importantly _verify_ all changes in this upgrade meet governance approvals)\n \n All validators, and full node operators should update their software to version *v8.0* as soon as possible once 67% of voting power has been reached, the changes have been accepted, and they have verified the code. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal to signal their readiness.\n \n Failure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\n \n Related commonwealth proposals: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4864-ust-derisking-proposal, https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4867-proposals-for-shifting-a-portion-of-liquidity-incentives-from-ust-and-luna-towards-usdc-dai-and-eth\n \n * Voting YES for this proposal indicates agreement for Osmosis validators to coordinate and perform an emergency upgrade to Osmosis, as authorised by greater than two-thirds of governance approval under the fast-voting conditions outlined above.\n \n * Voting NO for this proposal indicates that Osmosis should continue without any emergency upgrade action.",0

329,"Match External Incentives for BTSG/OSMO, BTSG/ATOM and BTSG/UST

**Background**
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

**Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the BitSong team for BTSG/OSMO (pool 573), BTSG/ATOM (pool 574) and BTSG/UST (pool 592). External incentives have already begun and will continue for 30 epochs.

By voting YES on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will be matched at ~$22,000 per day, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
By voting NO on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will NOT be matched at ~$22,000 per day, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG

**Context**
The BitSong team has provided the second batch of 1,500,000 BTSG across BTSG/OSMO pool 573, BTSG/ATOM pool 574 and BTSG/UST pool 592, amounting to ~$660,000, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG, over the course of 30 epochs beginning Wednesday, December 29th at 00:00am UTC.

The $BTSG incentives are as follows:

BTSG/OSMO (Pool #573): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
BTSG/ATOM (Pool #574): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
BTSG/UST (Pool #592): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$22,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/54, these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.",0

339,"Increase Community Tax

Juno was built as a 100% community driven initiative Without any VCs funds backing it that means it has to rely on the community pool for funding the Development on the network. Currently only 2% of the inflation is going towards the community Pool, which is a very negligible amount.

In order to continue funding development and have a Sustainable Ecosystem Juno requires a strong treasury/community Pool. This proposal requests to Increase the current community tax from 2% to 10% until at least the next halving which will result in the following benefits:

- Reduction of some part of the daily sell pressure on the Juno token because the inflation going towards stakers will decrease by 8%. The apr of staking Juno would fall from 39.91% to roughly around ~36.66%.

- The community pool would increase roughly by ~1.5million Juno (instead of ~300k Juno with the current tax) till the next halving.If this becomes a permanent change then the community pool would increase by ~9.2 million Juno in total (instead of ~1.8 million Juno with the current tax) till the end of the Juno’s 12 year inflation period.

- A stronger Community Pool will enable Juno community to conduct L1 to L1 swaps Which will enable Juno to have a diversified treasury.

- With a Larger community pool we will be able to use Juno tokens to have protocol owned Liquidity which will remove the need for Providing inflationary external incentives , which also affects the token price in a negative way, for Deep liquidity in Juno Pools.
*Some good resources explaining how protocol owned liquidity works:*

## Drawback of not increasing community tax

If Juno community pool doesn’t have any funds flowing into it right now it might end up in similar position like Cosmos hub in a few years ,where only $13 million out of the $3.2 billion chain valuation sit in the community pool which is around 0.4% of the current total supply. Even the Cosmos hub community has proposed to increase the community tax to 10% to increase the communtiy pool funds.

340,"Add a bias factor to external incentive matching

If another project allocates incentives to a non-osmo pool, Osmosis right now matches its incentives equally to how it matches non-osmo pools. This comes at a cost to all of the 'main' swap-fee driven pool incentives. (As this is osmo rewards they are not getting!)\n\nThis proposal proposes that external incentive matching maintain the same bias factor that is used for all incentivized pools within Osmosis. If the bias factor system (or equivalent preferential treatment for certain base asset) changes as time goes on, the external incentive matching should adapt in the same fashion.\n\nRight now proposal 127 feels ill-advised without this type of mechanism in place, as it is increasing the % of osmo incentives being allocated for incentive matching, without improving upon any of the core problems currently present in the external matching system. Right now, it is bad that there is no accounting for bias factors, thus over-paying for non-osmo base pair pools, and it is bad that a few high external incentive pools take the entire matching pot. There should instead be per-asset / per-pool caps, as there is 0 obligation for 1-1 matching as the ratio. It is also significant that prop 127 a significant 50% increase, without much discussion, put up in haste. And without the community being very clear that its going to lower APYs to every other pool, e.g. osmo/atom, osmo/ust, osmo/luna, with the difference being giving atom/huahua 300% instead of 210% osmo APY. In defense of proposal 127, this was done, due to the 20% cap for external incentive matching being made without a clear guideline for how it'll be enforced being agreed upon. (As it was not specified in prop 47)\n\nAs a response, this proposal is also put up in haste, to try to fix some of the core problems in a way that the commonwealth, Osmosis discord, and Osmosis siberia comunities have already expressed agreement in. Namely, make external incentive matching follow the same bias factor present in Osmosis. This concretely means that the Osmo-side bonus APY for external incentive ATOM pools will halve. However, the swap fee APY, swap-fee induced osmo APY, plus the actual external incentive APY will remain as before. This a better allocation for incentives that governance has already agreed upon, and it was inconsistent that this was not already being done for external incentive matching.",0

# Adan: non-profit fighting for sound crypto regulation

## Summary

- Adan is a non-profit organization representing the crypto-asset industry in Europe
- Since 2020, Adan has worked relentlessly to fight disproportional and overreaching regulations which threaten the crypto industry's ability to innovate
- We seek 8,000 ATOMS in funding to hire a European Affairs Officer as we ramp up operations in Brussels

## About Adan

Adan is a non-profit trade organization representing the crypto-asset industry. Our members are crypto-native companies and firms that provide industry-specific expertise (legal, consulting, marketing, etc.)

Founded in France in 2020, Adan has over [195 members 6](https://adan.eu/en/association/members) in France and Europe across several industry verticals, including DeFi, payments, market making, custody, data analysis, and security, and is the largest crypto trade organization in Europe.

Adan interacts with all stakeholders with interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.

Our unique positioning allows us to rally decentralized DeFi actors and more traditional listed companies and corporations.

### Mission

- Educate about crypto and help create better narratives around this technology and industry
- Foster an environment favorable to the growth of the industry
- Accompany the implementation of French and European regulatory frameworks adapted to the specificities of the sector
- Build constructive relations between the industry and public institutions

### Funding

Adan is a membership organization and is funded primarily through annual fees.

Being aware that our missions concern not only the Cosmos community but the whole crypto ecosystem, we will ask for grants from other blockchains. Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.

Finally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.

### Governance

Members define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.

See our website for more information about Adan's governance and [Board of Directors 3](https://adan.eu/en/association/governance).

Adan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).

### Works & Publications

Adan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.

Adan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.

In just two short years, Adan has produced an astounding amount of writing and [publications](https://adan.eu/en/publications) to support its mission:

- [A crypto-euro issued by an American giant, or how Europe is delegating its monetary sovereignty](https://adan.eu/en/tribune-les-echos-crypto-euro-en)

## Proposal details

The crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.

To this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:

- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.
- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.
- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.
- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).

To overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:

- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda
- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups
- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)
- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests

Given the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.

## Deliverables

We believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.

This report will be delivered to you via this forum. It will consist of different sections, such as :

- actions carried out in the last months;
- missions to be carried out in the coming months;
- distribution of the remaining allocation.

## Funding Amount

Total amount requested: 8,000 ATOM

This corresponds to roughly 100,000 EUR and covers gross salary, recruitment costs, and travel expenses for half a year.

This proposal includes the details regarding the loan of OSMO to Stargaze’s multi-sig and the parameters of the LBP. By voting Yes on this proposal will signify approval for both a loan of OSMO to Stargaze, and Stargaze will then launch and LBP with the following parameters with that funding. 
The request for a loan of 135,000 OSMO (~$724K) from the Osmosis community treasury to a multi-sig controlled by community members. Stargaze will use this OSMO to launch a 95/5 Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) on Osmosis. 

The members of this multi-sig will include: 
- James Parillo, Figment
- Shane Vitarana, Stargaze
- Cosmostation

Based on the LBP mechanics and OSMO volumes, the starting price of STARS will be $0.28.
Stargaze will pay back the value of the original loan in STARS once the LBP has ended.
There will be a 0.3% swap fee - Osmosis and Stargaze community pools will split the rewards of this fee 50/50.

Osmosis multi-sig public address: osmo1s3unu92e8zv8mfw7n5d4vrgkj9chn7yv0sh8rw 

Stargaze multi-sig public address: stars1s3unu92e8zv8mfw7n5d4vrgkj9chn7yvnhn27d


Background:
LBPs are a way to ensure a fair distribution of tokens at launch and to discover a fair market price of the token with low capital requirements. A 95/5 pool will have 95% of STARS to 5% of OSMO value. Over a period of 3 days, the goal is for the pool to reach 50/50 value.
LBPs allow teams to build liquidity without a large amount of upfront capital. It also separates the mechanisms for distributing tokens from the token price. This will be the first community pool loan for Osmosis and Stargaze.
Liquidity pools work within the crypto space with automated market makers, providing token holders and networks with liquidity through decentralized mechanisms. Liquidity pools usually only have a 50/50 ratio, where the value of Asset A equals the value of Asset B.

Potential Risks:
If there are no purchases for STARS, the price would fall to zero as the weighting decreases and the fluctuation in weighting creates constant downward pressure on the price.

Details about the LBP:
Start Time: December 16th, 2021 19:00 UTC
End Time: December 19th, 2021

Starting Liquidity: 50,000,000 STARS and 135,000 OSMO

End Ratio: 50/50

Starting Price:
STARS Price: $0.28 USD

349,"Regen token transfer

This is a signalling proposal for the transfer of 1.399mm $REGEN to the Osmosis community.

This transfer will be to the community pool address, giving osmo holders ownership and ability to utilize these tokens through the existing osmosis governance process.

We expect this allocation to be used strategically for protocol-owned liquidity provision, use-cases exploring eco-credits, modest provision of yield farming provisions, matching grants to public goods, and open-source development funding.

We propose the main criteria for judging use-cases should be the long term strategic benefit to leveraging the Osmosis DEX in partnership with Regen Network as an originator for ecological assets that create a new Regenerative Finance asset class native to our growing IBC ecosystem.

Voting YES on this proposal signals the Osmosis community’s willingness to receive this grant, and govern it for LONG TERM strategic benefit as outlined broadly above.
Voting NO would bump the conversation back to the forum posts and postpone a token transfer.

356,"Implement a fee-sharing mechanism

## TL;DR\nImplement a fee-sharing mechanism, where half of the transaction fee of a smart contract execution will go to the contract’s recipient address which is defaulted to the creator address, and the other half will go to stakers as per usual.\nThe proposed mechanism can potentially become a permanent incentive source for developers based on the raised user activity, in the form of executions, towards their developed smart contract.\n## Introduction\nJunø is the go-to smart contract zone in the ecosystem, due to its permissionless interoperability and lively community.\nOne of the main keys to grow and expand the core value of a smart contract platform is reflected by the applications and projects built on it, besides to the developers/contributors.\nTherefore, we intend to seek ways and methods to attract healthy development on Junø and promote the effectiveness behind adopting our platform to launch web3 applications. Such methods included offering grants, Hack Juno rewards, or community-pool based funding approved via governance.\nBut what if the chain offered built-in incentives for development on Junø? Will it attract further development and contributors to begin landing on Junø?\n## Contributor Fee-Based Incentives\nThe proposed solution is constructed around rewarding developers based on the overall user interest in what has been developed, which is potentially a longterm continuous reward.\nFor each smart contract, there will be a fee recipient address which is defaulted to the creator address.\nThe fee split parameter would be configurable via governance. As of now, we propose a 50/50% split.\nFor each transaction which executes the smart contract, 50% of the transaction fee is distributed to the fee recipient address. The remaining 50% is distributed to stakers.\nThis mechanism allows developers to be fairly rewarded as long as their development is raising activity and users are transacting with their smart contract. Fee distribution will not require voting or permission, and acts as longterm potential revenue, which can attract more developers to build on Junø.\n## How Contributor Incentives can commend DAOs\nOne of the optimistic outcomes will be the integration between DAO treasuries and on-chain smart contracts, where the treasury address can be the contract’s fee recipient address to receive fee-based incentives.\nFor example, JunoSwap can set the RAW DAO treasury as the contributor address, where 50% of the fees collected by JunoSwap transactions will be automatically received by the RAW DAO.\n## Postscript\nThis is a signaling proposal to evaluate the community’s interest in the proposed “Contributor Fee-Based Incentives” mechanism. Accordingly, the dev team will begin working on the implementation.\nThe proposed mechanism will not reduce or exclude the presence of other incentive programs such as Hack Juno, grants, or governance-approved funding.\n## Voting\n* By voting **YES** on this proposal, you agree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented.\n* By voting **NO** on this proposal, you disagree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented.\n* By voting **NO WITH VETO**, you disagree that the fee sharing mechanism should be implemented, and additionally intend to contribute towards proposal rejection and burning of proposal deposit if NoWithVeto votes are greater than a third of voting power.\n* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you decline to give an opinion on the proposition.",0

372,"Stableswap Incentive structure

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in modifying the incentives structure as below to facilitate Stableswap pools.\n\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in modifying the incentives structure as below to facilitate Stableswap pools.\n\n### About StableSwap\nStableswaps are pools that offer low slippage for two assets that are intended to be tightly correlated. There is a price ratio they are expected to be at, and the AMM offers low slippage around this price.\nStableswaps are the most popular pools across DeFi, providing deep liquidity in an ecosystem with no impermanent loss and sustainable yield from maintaining the peg between the two assets.\nThese are therefore important for Osmosis to implement and will be implemented in v13.\n\n### Incentives Category\nA new incentives category is proposed: *Stable/Stable* 
This category would include pools consisting of two, or more tokens which have been authorised as Stable assets and are pegged to the same currency.
i.e. EEUR/USDC would not be not a qualifying pool\n\n### Incentives Allocation\nShares of incentives are currently allocated to each category up to its cap.\nStableswap pools are strategically important to Osmosis' growth, as can be seen from the dominant pairs on alternative exchanges, and so the allocation of incentives should be higher than typical for a non-OSMO pool.\n\nWith multiple new dollar stablecoins emerging recently and pending, allocating a fixed % of incentives to the category will hugely benefit those with existing liquidity to draw on, and penalise those taking a more measured approach to slowly build their market-cap, encouraging excessive levels of risk taking.\n\nTo incentivise these pools this proposal puts forward a new set of rules for the Stable/Stable category only.\n\n* The Stable/Stable category shall be allocated a maximum share of 4% of LP emissions.\n    * Any unused incentive allocation will be proportionately shared between alternative categories rather than being normalised into Stable/Stable.\n* Pools will be automatically accepted for the external incentive matching program based on the following criteria:\n    * Using the Stableswap curve.\n    * Less than or equal to 0.05% fees.\n    * Composed entirely of governance-authorised Stablecoins, or GAMM derivatives of other pools meeting these criteria.\n    * All assets are intended by their minting process to be at minimum soft-pegged to the same denomination.\n    * Receiving external incentives, \n        * of at least 100 OSMO in equivalent value per day.\n        * for an epoch length of at least 7 around the date of OSMO incentive allocation.\n* Pools receiving native incentives must meet the following criteria:\n    * Using the Stableswap curve.\n    * Less than or equal to 0.05% fees.\n    * Composed of two or more governance-authorised Stablecoins.\n    * All assets are intended by their minting process to be at minimum soft-pegged to the same denomination.\n    * Passed by Governance as a core stableswap pool.\n    * This proposal recommends that the number of core stableswap pools is kept low to prevent duplication of liquidity locations but allows for multiple to exist.\n* Stable/Stable pools will have no maturity rating.\n    * Incentive matching changes will therefore follow at a lag of 5-12 days depending on the time of addition/removal compared to the routine incentives proposal.\n    * This allows Osmosis incentives to adapt to external incentive and volume changes as rapidly as possible.\n* Incentives will be allocated as a fee subsidy in line with the current model, however as there is no normalisation this will be a direct value matching until the cap is reached.\n    * Pools with external incentives auto-matching will receive a target allocation of $1 to $1 in external incentives, capped at $1 per $1 fees generated.\n    * The Pool with native incentives will receive a target allocation of $2 per $1 generated and cease to have any external incentives matched while receiving native incentives.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7917-stableswap-incentive-structure](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7917-stableswap-incentive-structure)",0

382,"Osmosis Carbon Neutrality through Purchasing and Retiring NCT

Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval to address Osmosis’ carbon emissions footprint by purchasing 1 year of carbon credits at worst case projections through Regen Network
Voting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated.
Based on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, Osmosis is projected to emit at most 5,100 tons a year in carbon, negatively affecting our climate. Regen Network, in partnership with Toucan and Moss.Earth, have already launched a version of NCT on Polygon at a price of $10 per credit.
This proposal asks for a spend of 6,600 $OSMO from the Community Pool to purchase 5,100 NCT from Regen Network to cover Osmosis’ historical carbon emissions, confirming Osmosis' carbon neutrality blockchain up to June 2022.

Method
 These funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of 
Cory Levinson (Regen Network)
Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)
NosNode (Osmosis Validator)

The $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase NCT. This will then be retired to offset Osmosis’ carbon emissions.
Any $OSMO remaining due to price fluctuations below the intentional 20% buffer to mitigate any price volatility, and a potentially lower NCT cost, will be returned to the Osmosis Community Pool.

* Voting YES for this proposal indicates that incentive categories not containing OSMO as a component should have external incentive matching capped as follows.\n    * Reduction in the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%\n    * Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1\n\n* Voting NO for this proposal indicates that all incentive categories will continue to be matched at a maximum 1:1 value ratio\n\n**Example:** https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1413b2b3-9d38-4865-8717-ba9a8ba4d0e7.1655974330412 \nAs an example of the proposed model, both FOO/OSMO and FOO/ATOM pools generate 30k per day in swap fees and have 15k provided in external incentives.  Currently Osmosis will match all 15k of these external incentives in both pools.  The line that reads 'Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1' causes the FOO/ATOM pools to have 7.5k spent on matching compared to 15k on FOO/OSMO pools.\n This is further limited if the fees generated are lower. In a scenario where both pools generate 5k per day in swap fees, currently, 5k of the 15k external incentives would be matched in both pools.  The line that reads 'Reduction in the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%' causes this 5k to be reduced to 1667 in matching on the FOO/ATOM pool.\ni.e. to achieve full matching the pool would need to generate 45k in swap fees.\nN.B. Example is weightings of fee allocation rather than actual figures.\n\n### Background\nExternal Incentive matching was first established in [Proposal 47](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) to incentivize their addition to Osmosis pools. This quickly grew into a major driver for incentive allocation following chains such as Stargaze, Chihuahua and Comdex adding large external incentives in comparison to the normal Osmosis incentive structure.\nIn order to preserve incentives for established projects, without external incentives but important for the growth of Osmosis as the IBC decentralised exchange, governance voted in Proposals [128](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/128) and 133 to implement a bias factor around how fees were used to calculate external incentive matching as well as a cap on matched Osmosis incentives relative to un-matched Osmosis incentives\nThe bias factor was defined as:\n\nThe same bias factor that is used for all incentivized pools within Osmosis. If the bias factor system (or equivalent preferential treatment for certain base asset) changes as time goes on, the external incentive matching should adapt in the same fashion.\n\nAt the time, this was a requirement of  equivalent of fees to be generated in a non-OSMO pool to provide the same matched incentives as  equivalent of fees in an OSMO pool as well as capping the match at up to 50% of the external incentive value.\nProposal 233 reworked the incentive system to use a set of categories to allocate incentives to pools based on their component assets rather than a bias system and so there was no new preferential treatment system for the matching system to adapt to, causing all external incentives to be matched equally in all pools.\nThis proposal asks that the previous matching biases be re-established in the new category model by:\n* Reducing the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%\n* Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1\n\nCategories affected:\n* Stable/Stable\n* Major/Stable\n* Other\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5767-external-incentive-matching-reduction-within-nonosmo-categories",0

395,"Delay of Hub Stargate Upgrade for approximately 2 weeks

The Stargate team is recommending that the Cosmos Hub reschedule the next upgrade to a new commit hash. The new commit hash is expected to be available on Tuesday Jan 26th with a new upgrade proposal immediately after.

This governance proposal will signal that [proposal 35](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/35) will not be executed. The Hub governance will vote on the forthcoming proposal aiming for a final upgrade. The earliest target date would be February 11th. Given that Lunar New Year is on Feb 12th. The next best date is Feb 18th 06:00UTC.

We are recommending the delay for the following reasons.

* Bugs have been identified in the Proposal 29 implementation.  They are resolved in this pull request[Additional review of prop 29 and migration testing by zmanian · Pull Request #559 · cosmos/gaia · GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/559)

## Summary
We are requesting 37500 ATOM from the Cosmos Hub Community Pool to make the Hub the main sponsor of the event and cover the prizes of the HackATOM Seoul challenges.

## Details
This is a community spend proposal to fund the prizes of the three main challenges that are part of the upcoming HackATOM in Seoul. Previous HackATOMs have demonstrated to directly benefit the Cosmos ecosystem and the Cosmos Hub by enabling the creation of innovative projects that spin off into successful products (e.g. CosmWasm, Osmosis, and many more)

We are requesting 37500 ATOM that will be sent to a multisig maintained by a committee that consists of:

* Zaki Manian | Co-Founder Sommelier
* Jelena Djuric | Interchain Security Product Manager & Marketing Lead at Informal Systems
* Marko Baricevic | Cosmos SDK Product Lead at Interchain

The multisig committee agrees to send the prices to the winners no later than 15 days after the event (August 14 at 8 UTC). In case some challenges do not have a clear winner, any surplus will be returned to the Cosmos Hub Community Pool.

411,"Establish Carbon Market on Osmosis

Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval of a joint funding venture with Regen Network to establish deep liquidity of a Carbon Market on Osmosis through protocol owned liquidity and pool incentives. 

 Voting NO to his proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated. 

Based on feedback from validators collected by Regen, the Cosmos ecosystem is projected to cause, at most, 84,700 tons a year of carbon dioxide emissions with an estimate of 22,596.5 tons of emissions.
In order to provide sufficient liquidity for any Cosmos chain or validator to choose to offset their project for multiple years it is proposed that liquidity of 211,750 NCT is established, owned between the Osmosis and Regen governance.
Regen Network intend to match any protocol owned liquidity in the NCT/REGEN pool and so to meet this target Osmosis would purchase 105,875 NCT at an estimated price of $10 a credit, as well as utilizing around 1.235 Million REGEN of the 1,399,507 gifted to the Osmosis community pool as an pooling pair.
The NCT/REGEN pool has been chosen as a non-incentivized pool. Due to Osmosis paying for liquidity based on fees, any fees generated by trading in this pool would result in Osmosis paying to incentivize liquidity that is not needed due to the unbonded protocol liquidity. This instead can act as a source of both tokens to seed other, incentivized pools, to increase liquidity and so stability of both NCT and REGEN across Osmosis as a whole through arbitrage.
As an added benefit, based on average swap fees, around 5,400 NCT would be acquired by this community pool held liquidity per year. A portion of this can be routinely retired and cause Osmosis’ carbon neutrality to be self-sustaining.
The remaining REGEN will be used to incentivize the NCT/OSMO pool to attract deeper liquidity, an arbitrage option for NCT/REGEN and a route to the Osmosis base pair for ease of trading. Around 165,000 REGEN should remain in the community pool after the previous two proposals, providing incentives of approximately $1,500 per day for 90 days.
Including a 20% buffer for price volatility, this proposal asks for a community pool spend of 140,000 $OSMO and 1,399,507 $REGEN to establish the Osmosis’ community pool share of this liquidity.
In order to ensure that supply and demand do not place an artificial premium on NCT, the pools will only become available on Osmosis once the ability to tokenise existing offchain carbon credits, non-custodially bridge NCT from Polygon across to the IBC and retire NCT on Regen is fully available to the average user through frontend tooling. This spend is being requested early as the cost of a Carbon Credit has recently been lower than usual and so Osmosis will be able to purchase this liquidity at a reduced rate in preparation for a coordinated launch.

Benefits to Osmosis
 The spend would be retained in the community pool as protocol owned liquidity and so no value should be lost from this proposal.
Swap fees in this pool, at Osmosis average, would generate around $54,000 in revenue each year for the protocol.
 Retiring a portion of this revenue each year will ensure that Osmosis remains carbon neutral permanently.
 Through encouraging use of the Regen Network, the value of Osmosis protocol owned liquidity will increase to cater for projects yet to be connected via IBC. 

Method
These funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of 
   Cory Levinson (Regen Network)
   Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)
    Nos Node (Osmosis Validator)

The $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase the NCT.
The NCT and any remaining $OSMO will then be returned to the multisig address on Osmosis.
200 $OSMO will then be used to establish NCT/REGEN and a OSMO/NCT pool on Osmosis. These costs are paid into the community pool.
All of the $NCT will then be paired with $REGEN in a ratio to maintain the purchase price of $NCT.
The GAMM tokens for NCT/REGEN will then be returned, unbonded, to the Osmosis Community Pool, along with any remaining $OSMO tokens.
Any remaining REGEN will be loaded as external incentives on the OSMO/NCT pool over a 90 day period, start time to be determined when NCT on Regen is fully live.

413,"[Action Required] Signalling Proposal for Emergency v8 Upgrade at 4402000

This proposal is for coordination of the emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary as already approved in proposals 225 and 226. It is an emergency upgrade hard fork for adding the unpooling feature for UST pools (prop 226) and shifting OSMO incentives off of LUNA and UST related pools (prop 225, 222-224).

This change has been reviewed by a number of validators and experienced cosmos developers. It has had pretty thorough testing on a testnet given the time constraints.

Addendums to unpooling not specified in 226

Unpooling of locks that are superfluid staked will not have slashing risk to avoid the large amount of code complexity implementing this would create and the time it would take to get implement it securely.

Additionally, it seems to have been the intention of prop 226 to include all UST pools, even though some were not included in the prop 226 text. This seems to have been human error on the proposal creators part. Several validators have signalled being in favor of this through several chats.

Upgrade information

This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The v8.0.0 software version is fully state-compatible with v7.3.0 until the upgrade block 4402000, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v6 upgrade (prop 103), used when the IBC channel creation mechanism was broken.
The proposed upgrade block height of 4402000 is estimated to be at May 15, 2022, 16:00 UTC (Sunday).
All validators, and full node operators should update their software to version v8.0.0 prior to 14:00 UTC (Sunday). After doing so, validators should vote yes on this proposal signalling that they have upgraded.
Failure to do so will cause the node to crash – requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.

Actionable(s)
Every node should upgrade their software version from v7.3.0 to v8.0.0 before the upgrade block height 4402000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at upgrades/v7/bin to be v8.0.0, and restart the node. Do check that cosmovisor version says 8.0.0.
Upon upgrading their setup and processing a block, every validator should vote yes on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade.)
Every node should check in at May 15th 2PM (14:00) UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have voted yes on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didn’t upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of the validator voting power has not signalled readiness by 2PM (14:00) UTC, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should revert their binary back to v7.3.0 until further notice.
Furthermore, please review the numbers for the accelerated incentives updates in https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/1481/files#diff-cafe8a3f5831b68ac650982d09609c545f5990c6a1e6602ea4fb5c9bc04aa3bb, and v8 logic.

Failure case and risks involved

In the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - “validators” channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis)

Governance procedure

Voting Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan and that you applied the upgrade and successfully processed a block after.

Voting No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.",0
414,"[Action Required] IBC patch upgrade at 2464000

# [Action Required] IBC patch upgrade at 2464000\\n\\nThe v5 upgrade had a subtle bug that prevents creation of new IBC channels.\\n\\nNo current user funds are at risk, and the bug does not affect trading, LP, bonding.\\n\\nAll existing IBC channels function just as before, IBC deposits and withdrawals for existing assets are not affected.\\n\\nThe bug solely prevents new channels from being created, preventing new chains from connecting to Osmosis. Bug details at the end.\\n\\nThis proposal suggests doing an emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v6 binary. This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The [v6.0.0 software version](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v6.0.0) is fully state-compatible with `v5.0.0` until the upgrade block `2464000`, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v3 upgrade (prop 17), used when the governance deposit mechanism was broken.\\n\\nThe proposed upgrade block height of 2464000 is estimated to be at December 20, 2021, 16:00 UTC (Monday).\\n\\nAll validators, and full node operators should update their software to version `v6.0.0` prior to block height 2464000. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\\n\\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\\n\\n## Actionable(s)\\n\\n* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0`, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0.\\n* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\\n* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\\n\\n## Failure case and risks involved\\n\\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - ""validators"" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis)\\n\\nNote: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\\n\\n## Governance procedure\\n\\n A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\\n A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\\n\\nDeposits are intended to be used by validators here.\\n\\n- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key. Please do this, even if your validator operator key is behind a multisig. This is a good time to take advantage of authz, to allow easier depositing & voting.\\n- Once over 66% of voting power has signalled readiness, this upgrade proposal is considered valid.\\n- Should this proposal fail to gather readiness signalling from two-thirds of voting power by December 20th 4AM UTC, the upgrade proposal should be considered failed and validators should revert to the old binary prior to block 2464000.\\n\\n## Testing methodology\\n\\nThis upgrade has been tested to be compatible with v5.0.0 until the upgrade height on a testnet. This was done by having a v6.0.0 validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected). The v6.0.0 node could then receive IBC transfers.\\n\\n## Bug Details\\n\\nRelevant issue: [osmosis-labs/osmosis #665](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/665)\\n\\nTL;DR - There was a subtle misconfiguration in the Osmosis app.go. This slipped in from a copy-paste error during the SDK 42 -> 44 upgrade. This manifested in being unable to create new channels.\\n",0

For instructions on performing the upgrade see https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/upgrade-node.html

# Background

Since the last v6-Vega upgrade at height 86950000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint.

This is a proposal to adopt the first release for the [v7-Theta](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.md#v7-theta-upgrade-expected-q2-2022) upgrade the `cosmoshub-4` mainnet.

It contains the following changes:

- (gaia) bump [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.1](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.1). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.1/CHANGELOG.md#v0451---2022-02-03) for details.
- (gaia) bump [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) module to [v3.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.0.0). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v3.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#v300---2022-03-15) for details.
- (gaia) add [interhcian account](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/main/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts) module (interhchain-account module is part of ibc-go module).
- (gaia) bump [liquidity](github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity/x/liquidity) module to [v1.5.0](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.5.0). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/blob/v1.5.0/CHANGELOG.md#v150---20220223) for details.

- (gaia) add migration logs for upgrade process.

# On-Chain Upgrade Process
When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on Cosmovisor to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. To test a simulated local upgrade please see the local testnet documentation. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.

For full instructions please see https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/upgrade-node.html

### Potential Risk Factors

Although very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v6.0.x).",0
426,"Fix IBC transfers between Lum Network and Osmosis

Follow-up on proposal #111 which was rejected on purpose, read the details below for more information.

**Proposal goal:**

This proposal will enable the unfreezing process of the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network, thus allowing deposits and withdrawals of **$LUM** on the Osmosis platform:

- By voting **YES**, OSMO stakers voice their support in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network
- By voting **NO**, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network

This proposal has no effect beside enabling back the IBC connection between the two chains.

**Details:**

The IBC connection between Osmosis and the Lum Network was shutdown during the **$LUM** Liquidity Bootstrapping Phase in order to have a proper price discovery without external interferences.

Shutting down the IBC connection froze the currently use channel (3-115). Meaning that no IBC transfer can be made using this channel unless this governance proposal is voted **YES** by OSMO stakers.

The process to enable IBC transfers back require to substitute the current IBC client by a new one that is not in an expired state.

This proposal is a follow-up on the proposal #111 which was rejected on purpose since it raised technical concerns.
Indeed, this process had not been tested properly in production prior to proposal #111 and Lum team along Osmosis team agreed to provide a better testing background prior to asking everyone to vote YES to this proposal.

Tests have now been performed succesfully and we are confident this proposal will not have undesired side effects!
The following repository contains a full test suite representing what will happen once this proposal is voted YES: https://github.com/lum-network/ibc-testbed

# V9 Lambda upgrade (with Replicated Security)

***Terminology note:** Interchain Security is the name for a family of protocols. The feature being discussed here is in this family, but more accurately termed “Replicated Security”. In the past it has been referred to as Interchain Security v1, or ICS, but going forward we refer to it as Replicated Security.*

## Summary
This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt . By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.  

The Cosmos Hub is upgrading its security system with a new feature called Replicated Security. This will allow the Cosmos Hub to provide its strong security to other blockchains, which are called 'consumer chains'. The cost to censor or control a consumer chain with an economic attack is the same as the cost to censor or control the Cosmos Hub itself. This means that consumer chains can benefit from the Cosmos Hub's security without having to maintain their own validator sets.  

Replicated Security works through the IBC protocol. Consumer chains receive periodic IBC packets containing the up-to-date validator set of the Cosmos Hub and use this to update their own validator sets, effectively replicating the Hub's validator set. This means that the Cosmos Hub's validators can validate multiple chains at once with the same stake.  

In exchange for this service, consumer chains are expected to send a portion of their fees and inflation to the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators. These tokens will then be included as part of the Cosmos Hub's staking rewards.

## Software details
### Updates
* (feat) Add [Interchain-Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v1.0.0) provider module. See the [ICS Spec](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation/README.md) for more details.
* (gaia) Bump [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.13-ics](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics) for details.
* (gaia) Bump [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to [v4.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v4.2.x/CHANGELOG.md). See [v4.2 Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for details.
* (gaia) Bump [tendermint](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to [0.34.26](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/tree/v0.34.26). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/blob/v0.34.26/CHANGELOG.md#v03426) for details.
* (gaia) Bump [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) to [v4.0.4](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v4.0.4).
* (tests) Add [E2E ccv tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/tests/e2e/e2e_gov_test.go#L138). Tests covering new functionality introduced by the provider module to add and remove a consumer chain via governance proposal.
* (tests) Add [integration ccv tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/tests/ics/interchain_security_test.go). Imports Interchain-Security's  and implements Gaia as the provider chain.

### On-Chain Upgrade Process
When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary.  

Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local).

### Potential Risk Factors
Although very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.  

Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the #validators-verified channel of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v8.0.1).

## Governance votes
The following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:

* YES - You approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.
* NO - You don’t approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub. Please indicate why on the Cosmos Hub forum.
* NO WITH VETO - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.
* ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

## Appendix: Replicated Security
### Changes to this proposal
This proposal went onto the governance forum in mid-December. Since that time, we have made one change to the protocol. In response to the only high-severity finding in the Informal audit report (see 'Testing and audits below'), and feedback from the community, we have made it so that the slashing and tombstoning of validators for offenses on consumer chains must be approved by a governance vote. This will have a [very minimal impact](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing) on the operation and security of consumer chains while protecting the Cosmos Hub from possibility of an attack by a rogue consumer chain.  

This governance gating is temporary until the Cosmos Hub is able to cryptographically verify proof of double signing in an upcoming release of Replicated Security. This does not give governance the ability to slash validators arbitrarily, but rather to approve slash packets that have already been transmitted from a consumer chain.

### The ATOM economic zone
It is anticipated that consumer chains using Replicated Security will collaborate closely in an 'ATOM economic zone'. This is expected to have a snowball effect, with the Cosmos Hub securing a growing group of high-value decentralized protocols. Already, some prominent projects such as a smart-contracting platform, an AMM, several liquid staking providers and others have expressed interest in using Replicated Security from the Cosmos Hub.  

Replicated Security can also be used to further the cause of “Hub minimalism”. Any new features to the Hub, even if they are core to the Hub's functionality, can be launched as consumer chains. This allows the Hub to scale better and separate release cycles, enabling faster deployment of new features.

### Onboarding a consumer chain
This governance proposal will not launch any consumer chains on its own. Instead, it will only add the necessary code to the Cosmos Hub to enable Replicated Security. In order to launch, each consumer chain must submit their own governance proposal to be voted on separately.  

It is expected that before launch, a consumer chain will have participated in a Cosmos Hub Replicated Security testnet, conducted their own testnets, and undergone an audit by reputable auditors.  

Once a consumer chain proposal passes, Cosmos Hub validators can begin running the consumer chain and receiving rewards. The chain will only start if more than two-thirds (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators decide to run the consumer chain.

### Offboarding a consumer chain
Once the consumer chain is running, validators can be slashed and jailed for consensus faults such as downtime and double signing on the consumer chain.  

At any point in time, one-third (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators will be able to stop running the consumer chain at once: the chain will halt, and none of them will be slashed for downtime.  

The offboardings of consumer chains will have strong social norms to protect both sides, and any kind of forceful exit will only be coordinated in extreme cases such as protocol failures or attacks.  

For normal cases, a separate governance proposal will be made to remove a consumer chain, which will allow Cosmos Hub validators to stop running it.

428,"Remove Superfluid Staking from OSMO/UST (#560) and OSMO/LUNA (#561) 

By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in disabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/UST (#560) and OSMO/LUNA (#561) pools on Osmosis. \n\n By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in disabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/UST (#560) and OSMO/LUNA (#561) pools on Osmosis. \n\n Details\n This proposal would disable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/UST (#560) and OSMO/LUNA (#561) pools. These pools currently contain around 7% of OSMO liquidity, however this is rapidly decreasing as users unbond and the value of UST and LUNA fluctuate through unforeseen volatility causing there to be fewer OSMO in the pool. \n At the current 50% discount rate, this would unstake up to ~2.6 million OSMO which were being used to secure the network through staking. However as many users are unbonding from these pools this will be lower. See https://hathornodes.com/resources/staking_dashboard for the recent drop in OSMO being used for Superfluid Staking that indicates this.\n Superfluid proposals ask whether governance trusts in the stability and security of these chains sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance. \n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4878-urgent-remove-all-terra-related-incentives",0
429,"Osmosis v9 Nitrogen Upgrade

## Osmosis Nitrogen Upgrade\n\nThis is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v9.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 4707300, which is estimated to occur on Tuesday June 7th, UTC 16:00. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.\n\n## Upgrade Features\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n\n### GAMM API changes\nAPI changes were done to enable more CFMM's to be implemented within the existing framework.\nIntegrators will have to update their messages and queries to adapt, please see https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/gamm/breaking_changes_notes.md\n\n### Governance Changes\n* Superfluid stakers now have their votes override their validator's votes\n* Governance can set a distinct voting period for every proposal type\n\n### IBC\n* Upgrade to IBC v3\n* Enable Interchain account host module\n* See [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/app/upgrades/v9/upgrades.go#L49-L71) for the supported messages\n\n### Txfees\n* Non-osmo txfees now get swapped into osmo every day at epoch, and then distributed to stakers.\n\n### Cosmwasm\n* Upgrade from wasmd v0.23.x to v0.27.0. This has the following features:\n  * State sync now works for cosmwasm state\n  * Cosmwasm builds on M1 macs\n  * Many security fixes\n\n* The TokenFactory module is added to the chain, making it possible for users and contracts to make new native tokens.\n    * Cosmwasm bindings have been added, to make swapping and creating these new tokens easier within the contract ecosystem.\n\n\n## Getting Prepared for the Upgrade\nAs always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.\n\nIf using cosmovisor, either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v9/bin/.\n\nIf not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v9.0.0 binary.\n\n\n## Details of Upgrade Time\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be 4707300, anticipated to be on Tuesday June 7th 16:00 UTC. This uses an average block time of 6.3730 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown [here](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/4707300)\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.",0

**Proposal descriptions:**

[Pool #618 (ATOM/DSM)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/618) and [Pool #619 (DSM/OSMO)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/619) have been live since 13 January 2022 with promising growth in liquidity and transaction volume so far. A total of 5,000,000 DSM external incentives for 180 epoch (27,777.78 DSM per epoch) for these two pools have become effective on 15 Jan 2022.

If this proposal is passed, it will enable matching of these external incentives with extra OSMO incentives.

**About DSM**

Desmos Token, or DSM, is the native token on the Desmos blockchain. Built with Cosmos SDK, Desmos serves as the backbone to empower the development of user-centric decentralized social networks in the metaverse.

To make Desmos more community-driven, we have launched a 21m DSM airdrop program (21% of the genesis supply) to over 280,000 wallet addresses across 11 Cosmos ecosystem chains.

# v8-Rho Software Upgrade

## Summary

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt Gaia `v8.0.0`. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.

This upgrade does not include the Replicated Security feature; that will be part of the v9-Lambda upgrade.

The forum post discussing this upgrade can be found [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/upcoming-interchain-accounts-bugfix-release/8911/8).

#### Background
Since the last v7-Theta upgrade at height 9283650 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to Gaia.

**Updates**
- Bump [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to `v3.4.0` from `v3.0.0` which includes a fix for the interchain accounts vulnerability. See the full [Changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v3.4.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.
- Bump [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to `v0.45.12` from `v0.45.9`. See the full [Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.12) and [Commit History](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/compare/v0.45.9...v0.45.12) for details and updates between the last version of the SDK used in Theta. 
- Bump [Tendermint](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to `v0.34.24` and replace with the [Informal Systems fork](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to ensure software continuity.
- Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity) to `v1.5.3` which notably includes updating Go to `1.18` and the Cosmos-SDK to `v45.11` to ensure compatiblity with the Cosmos Hub.
- Bump [Packet Forward Middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) to `v3.1.1`  from `v2.1.1`. Users should note that PFM was not configure properly in the previous version of Gaia. This module update includes necessary bug fixes to make it functional on the Cosmos Hub in v8.

**Features**
- Add the [Global Fee](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/main/x/globalfee) module to the Cosmos Hub, which enables setting transaction fees at the network level via `param-change` governance proposal. For more information, see the [module documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/modules/globalfee.md).
- Add the `debug bech32-convert` [command](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/1845), enabling users to convert any bech32 string to the cosmos prefix. 

**Fixes**
- Fix Bank Denom Metadata [issue](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/1892). In a previous upgrade, the `x/bank` metadata was incorrectly migrated, resulting in an incorrect bank metadata. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L19) for more information. 
- Fix Quicksilver ICA exploit detailed in the [forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/upcoming-interchain-accounts-bugfix-release/8911) on the incident. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L58) for more information.

**Tests**
- Add a [suite of E2E tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/release/v8.0.x/tests/e2e) to ensure core features of the Cosmos Hub work as expected.


#### Testnet
V8 Rho went live on the persistent testnet after the successful simulated upgrade. For more information, see the testnet [upgrade proposal](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/proposals/112) or [block explorer](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/), and visit the [persistent testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public).

#### On-Chain Upgrade Process

This upgrade can be performed in multiple ways. When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically *before* swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.

#### Potential Risk Factors

Although very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v7.1.0).",0

433,"Osmosis v5 Boron Upgrade

# Osmosis v5 Boron Upgrade\n\n [Rendered](https://hackmd.io/tJHNqU_kRW6ZTdGNQNHlIQ?view) \n\nThis proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the [v5.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0) software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `2383300`. The timing of this upgrade is crucial to properly execute the [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) airdrop clawback. This clawback should happen right at the Airdrop end date of December 15th 5PM UTC, thus this upgrade must execute before it. \n\nThe upgrade block height `2383300` is estimated to be at December 14th, UTC 2:30PM. Block times have high variance, so please be monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \n\n## Upgrade features\n\nThis upgrade adds features such as:\n\n- Upgrade Cosmos-SDK to [SDK v0.44](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) from SDK v0.42 For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see its [changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21). Noteable highlights include:\n    - [Authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) - Allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). \n- New modules:\n    - [Bech32IBC](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/bech32-ibc) - Allows auto-routing of send msgs to addresses on other chains, once configured by governance. Allows you to do a bank send on Osmosis to a cosmos1... address, and it is automatically sent to the corresponding Cosmos Hub address over IBC. This is a big step in enabling more seemless IBC UX.\n    - [TxFees](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees) - Enables validators to easily accept txfees in multiple assets, whitelisted by governance, by declaring minimum fees in OSMO.  Alternative fee assets are converted to their OSMO value, using the spot price on their primary OSMO base pair pool.  This upgrade pre-whitelists all the assets currently supported on the Osmosis frontend with an OSMO basepair pool.\n- Implements [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) - Clawback of unclaimed Osmo and Ion on airdrop end date. (December 15th, 5PM UTC)\n- Upgrade IBC from a standalone module in the SDK to [IBC v2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). This improves the utility of Ethereum Bridges and Cosmwasm bridges.\n- Blocking [OFAC banned ETH addresses](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sanctions/1.0/sdn_advanced.xml) \n- Numerous minor bug fixes, gas fixes, and significant speedups.\n\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\nAll nodes will require 32GB of memory. Swap can be used to achieve this, but getting nodes with 32GB RAM is _significantly_ preferred. Furthermore, NVMe SSDs significantly improve the speed of execution.\n\nPlease follow the setup instructions here for how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.x/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v5/guide.md).\n\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you have to install cosmovisor from the SDK v0.42.9 branch) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v5.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin/`.\n\nIf you do not want to use cosmovisor due to cosmovisor reliability issues, please be prepared to upgrade at around 2:30PM UTC, December 14th if this proposal passes.\n\n## Details of upgrade time\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the Osmosis blockchain will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v5.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `2383300`, anticipated to be at `Wednesday December 14th 2:30PM UTC (9:30AM EST)`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.65 seconds per block, derived from Cros-nest dashboard. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 100 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\n",0
434,"Multihop Discount on Osmosis Pools

Voting Yes for this proposal indicates that a multihop discount should be adopted when OSMO is the intermediary token\n\nVoting No for this proposal indicates that the current swap fee structure should remain in place\n\nThis proposal is to develop and implement a multihop discount on OSMO pools to provide traders with the lowest fee possible and promote the use of OSMO pools.\nWhen a trade consists of just two OSMO pools during a single transaction, the swap fees would be automatically halved. This would result in cheaper transactions for all trades no matter the volume being traded as well as a higher proportion of the costs going to swap fees and so liquidity providers rather than being lost to slippage.\nOSMO pools currently used in multi-hop transactions would see lower fees generated per trade, but counter-intuitively, the total swap fees generated over time will increase due to the lower fees per transaction encouraging a much higher volume of trades due to a phenomenon known as volatility harvesting.\n\nMore information and discussion on Commonwealth: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4175-multihop-discount-on-osmosis-pools",0
435,"Osmosis v7 Carbon Upgrade

# Osmosis Carbon Upgrade\n\nThis proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the [v7.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `3401000`, which is estimated to occur on February 28, UTC 8:00PM. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \n\n## Upgrade features\n\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\n* Superfluid Staking\n* Permissioned CosmWasm\n* IAVL improvements (improved epoch times)\n* UX improvements around LP bonding\n\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v7.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\n\nAll nodes will require 64GB of memory. This must consist of a **minimum** of 32GB of RAM, while the remaining 32GB can be swap. For best results, use 64GB of physical memory. Note that this is **double the recommendation for the Boron upgrade**. Also note that the inclusion of wasm means that nodes must use amd64 to run.\n\nPlease refer to the following setup instructions on how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md).\n\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you should install the v1.0.0 release of cosmovisor) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v7.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin/`.\n\nIf you do not wish to use cosmovisor, be prepared to upgrade at around 8:00PM UTC, February 28th if this proposal passes.\n\nThe Osmosis blockchain will halt when network reaches the halt height. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v7.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\n\n## Details of upgrade time\n\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `3401000`, anticipated to be at `Monday February 28th 8:00PM UTC`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.46 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\n\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 120 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\n\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\n\n### Testing your upgrade setup\n\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\n\n\n### Superfluid delegation \n\nIn this upgrade""s superfluid module, you can stake LP shares for specific governance-approved pools. A ""superfluid discount factor"" parameter exists for the superfluid module to ensure stability in the early rollout of superfluid staking, the superfluid discount factor parameter is set to 50% in this upgrade. This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.\n\nThe user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.\n\nHere is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:\n\n#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing\n*Condition*\n- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.\n- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.\n- Suppose you have designated validator ""Dogemosis"" as your superfluid validator.\n- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%\n\n*Result*\n- Your delegation to ""Dogemosis"" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.\n- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.\n- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares. In essence, effective slashing rate increases to the lower the risk factor is set to.\n\n#### On Changes to the delegation amount depending on changes in spot price\nLets now suppose the spot price in the pool changes during this epoch to be 1 ATOM = 1 OSMO, and your LP share changes to being `(75 OSMO, 75 ATOM)`. Upon the next epoch, the effective staked OSMO amount will be calculated as `75 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 67.5 OSMO` to reflect the change in the underlying OSMO amount of the LP token.\n\nAs the amount of OSMO backing the LP share increased (hence increasing the effective superfluid staked amount), the staking rewards will also increase.",0

* By voting **Yes**, you agree to the governance module changes listed below, allowing them to be enabled during the next upgrade.\n\n* By voting **No**, you reject the below changes to enable the expedited proposals during the next upgrade.\n\n## Background\nThis is a proposal to introduce changes to the governance module and allow any future proposal to be expedited similar to the method of [Prop 225](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/225). This will give Osmosis governance built-in flexibility to act quickly in the case of emergencies.\n\n## Details\nWith this feature enabled, a proposer can flag any proposal as Expedited when putting it on-chain.\n\nIf expedited, the deposit to enter voting period will be increased to 5000 OSMO. The proposal will have 24 hours to achieve a two-thirds majority of all staked OSMO voting power voting YES.\n\nIf it achieves that two-thirds majority within that time, it will be considered to have passed.\n\nIf it does not achieve the two-thirds majority within 24 hours, it will be converted to a normal proposal and run for the rest of the normal proposal period under normal rules. (If it is vetoed, even after having been converted to a normal proposal, the proposer will still lose the entire 5000 OSMO deposit.)\n\n## Implementation\nThese changes will be effected by implementing the two Github repositories linked here. \n\n1) The original feature and spec can be found [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/240).\n\n2) Based on the feedback from Commonwealth, the functionality for configuring a separate, higher deposit [has been added](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/254). 5,000 OSMO (as above) will be the initial parameter.\n\n## Potential Parameter Changes for Future Governance \nThe enlarged proposal deposit can of course be changed by a DAO vote. Likewise, further safety guards can and should be discussed in future threads and proposals. \n\nThese heightened safety guards might include requiring more than a two-thirds threshold to approve an emergency proposal, or they might require an additional delay, such as a longer-than-24-hour voting period for less acute emergencies. Further, governance could add a built-in implementation delay, during which voters could change their votes as the emergency evolved or as new information and perspectives came to light, particularly if it became apparent that the expedited proposal had been subject to a governance attack.\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5035-governance-module-upgrade-twothirds-majority-emergency-voting-periods-24hr",0
438,"Proposal to adjust blocks per year param

This proposal is to correct the blocks per year parameter to be in line with the current network performance.

The original blocks per year parameter of 6311520 was calculated with the block time assumption of 5s. In reality, this block time has tracked closer to 6.247111s, which corresponds to 5048093 blocks per year.

Changing this parameter will result in the minting module changing to phase 2 closer to the anticipated time of 12 months after launch. Changing this parameter will also result in the mint per block increasing from 4.113319 juno per block to 5.142792 juno per block.

This proposal would give a 0.5% incentive share to pools 560 (Osmo/Ust) and 561 (Osmo/Luna) which would start paying out on the epoch of October 26. This would allow these pools to gain incentives sooner than they would following the standard process (October 29).\n\nThese incentive shares would be taken from the 1% of LP incentives currently paid to the community pool (so as not to disrupt the incentives of existing pools or the regular process). This share of funding is in addition to the 5% of overall issuance going to the community pool, so in effect it would change the community pool's share of Osmo issuance from 5.45% to 5%.\n\nThis proposal would also act as governance agreement to these pools entering the onboarding process for regular incentive adjustments going forward.\n\nIf passed, these pools will be added to the regular adjustment proposal on October 25, but would start receiving incentives at this 0.5% rate on October 26, and would then be adjusted to the appropriate level on October 29 following passage of the regular adjustment proposal.\n\nIf not passed, these pools will not be added to the spreadsheet / regular adjustment process, and will not start receiving incentives until approved (in another text proposal) and added to a regular adjustment proposal.",0

By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for adding osmo incentives to JUNO on Osmosis.

**Details**

The following proposal is a basic signaling proposal to include JUNO pairs into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.

Regular JUNO/OSMO and JUNO/ATOM pools will go live on Osmosis AMM shortly after Juno's October 1st mainnet launch.

When the pools are first created on Osmosis, they will not be incentivized. 10-13 days after pools creation, if this signaling proposal is passed, the pools will be added to the regular incentive update proposal through the onboarding process.

Furthermore a proposal will go live on the Juno mainnet to request community pool funding to boost the above mentioned pairs and to contribute to a potential allocation by the Osmosis Hub.",0
441,"Remove blocked.go from Osmosis

# Proposal\n\n This proposal aims to come to consensus that we should delete the blocked.go file in the Osmosis Github Repository (https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/app/blocked.go). My name is Anthony Rosa, and I am the project lead at Moultrie Audits. Centralized entities like Tether are holding firm to protect censorship resistance (https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1562468486886346753?s=20&t=R3Gc5J6rUnSfOzeYxNZyuw). There are many aspects to this conversation, and it is encouraged to read through the associated commonwealth threads (linked below) prior to voting. The blocked.go file prevents users from withdrawing to the contained blocked addresses, and the file comments state “we block all OFAC-blocked ETH addresses from receiving tokens.” If we accept as a community that we should censor addresses the government deems illegitimate, our entire purpose becomes questionable.\n\n # Reasons To Delete blocked.go\n\nWhy have a blockchain if the service retains the censorship restrictions of Web2? How can we claim to be decentralized while preventing users from accessing a service through a central repository subject to revision by the government? Why wouldn’t this set a censorship precedent? Are we here to make money or change the world? \n\nIt is my opinion that it’s better if we fail trying to democratize finance with a truly decentralized DEX than succeed as a TradFi proxy, touting disingenuous values. In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated, “If we do nothing about it now, you will see a slow but steady erosion of your right to trade freely...We need to come together and support our freedom to trade crypto in the spirit with which most of it has been developed – permissionlessly.”\n\n# Counterarguments\n\nThere are severe possible consequences for not complying with OFAC or any other government requirement to block specific addresses. Removing the functionality to block addresses at a protocol level opens up financial and legal risk to infrastructure providers, developers, users, investors, and the entire Osmosis community. Validator level censorship is still a possibility, but an additional burden.\n\n In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated “I don't think this is morally the right direction, by the US government, or by implementing these policies. However, I do think logically it is the best step forward to preserve and protect our validators.” \n\n# Vote Explanation\n\nYes: Developers should move to remove the blocked.go file from the Osmosis repo. We’ll start by deleting the addresses in the file.\n No: We should keep the blocked.go file and associated functionality.\nNo With Veto: You believe this proposal is spam or malicious to Osmosis and we should keep the blocked.go file and associated functionality. Moultrie Audits will lose the deposit.\n\n# Links\n\nCommonwealth Thread: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/6591-blockedgo-ofac | https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/6734-remove-blockedgo-from-osmosis\n Longer Justification To Deleting blocked.go: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeJ2g7ths2HpqqhnHYmGPr4RcJemWHSEQ6p8jpBQDq8gY/Osmosis%20Prop.pdf",0

443,"Signaling proposal: Create a osmosis bug bounty

## Background\nOn the 8th June 2022 at 02:49:55 UTC a major bug in the osmosis AMM has forced the validators to halt the network at block 4713064. The issue was that withdrawing funds from liquidity pools would result in getting assets worth more than what you had in the pool. This bug could've potentially drained the assets in all liquidity pools accross osmosis by simply adding liquidity and directly removing it again. Fortunately, the damage was limited to only 5 million dollars due to the fast reaction of the validators. However, apart from the financial damage, the 3-day shutdown also cost a lot of trust, which has to be earned again in the long term.\n\n## Bug Bounty/Vulnerability Disclosure Policy\nTo prevent the malicious exploitation of such bugs I would like to propose two things:\n1. **Creation of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**\nThe goal of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy is to encourage people to report bugs privately to the osmosis devs before making it public. Such policy would give information about how osmosis has to react to such bug reports and also give the reporting user the security to no being persecuted legally. I'll add some examples for such policy:\n\n    https://hackerone.com/riot?type=team\n    https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/bug-fix-policy\n    https://support.crowdin.com/vulnerability-policy/ \n\n2. **Creation of a according but bounty program**\nHaving a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy usually also means having a bug bounty program to incentivise the reporting of such bugs instead of abusing them. The bounty paired with the legal security should then hopefully be enough to ensure critical bugs can be fixed before being disclosed to the public.\nImmunefi is a platform where many crypto projects are running their bug bounty program (Polygon, MakeDAO, THORChain, PancakeSwap, etc.). Also Sifchain is having a bug bounty program there with rewards up to 2M$.\nThis Bug Bounty should be funded by the strategic Osmo reserve and the community pool. Furthermore, core devs and external and independent actors should be involved in the bug bounty dao/team.\n\n\n### Note\nA bug bounty program doesn't mean that reported bugs are swept under the carpet. A vulnerability disclosure policy also includes when and how bugs can/will be disclosed to the public.\n___\nYES -> You aggree that a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure should be created and carried out. The creation itself with the exact policy will have to pass governance again.\nNO -> You believe that's not neccessary and don't want a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure policy\nNO WITH VETO -> You believe such policy/bug bounty would harm the network and want to prevent that at all cost",0

445,"Increase the Community Pool Tax on the Cosmos Hub - Parameter Change

# Increase Community Pool Tax Rate

*Authors:* [Simply Staking](https://twitter.com/SimplyStaking)

## Summary

The aim of this proposal is to increase the community tax rate from the current 2% to 10% with the aim of increasing inflows to the community pool in order to help with future funding that brings utility to the Cosmos Hub.

## Background

Over the past couple of weeks, there have been a lot of fruitful yet sometimes heated discussions regarding the funding model for the Cosmos Hub.

‘Why do we need to create a treasury’ was asked regarding a proposed overhaul of the tokenomics model of the Hub and oftentimes the general consensus would be that it’s to future proof funding for the Cosmos Hub and anything that would need to be built or funded. The proposed solution was to have a direct mint of tokens to a treasury pool.

However, the Hub already has a Community Pool that has been used in the past for various community spend proposals. This pool is funded through taxation on a per-block basis. The current tax rate is 2%. By increasing this we can achieve a similar outcome of expanding the pool of funds available for public good funding, without the immediate creation of a new entity or the bulk minting of ATOM.

This proposal aims to increase inflows to the Community Pool to make it more in line with what we see around the ecosystem and to ensure that funding for future endeavours are secured. This is merely just a first step and more improvements will come later.

## Community Pools comparison

As a chain, the Cosmos Hub has a fairly small community pool compared to its market capitalisation:

Cosmos Hub - 1.24M ATOMs ~ $13M / Market Cap $3.1BN

Osmosis - 52.13M OSMO ~ $60.4M / Market Cap $560M

Juno - 15.73M JUNO ~ $37.3M / Market Cap $150M

Stargaze - 445M STARS ~ $20.5M / Market Cap $60M

Looking at other projects across the Cosmos Ecosystem, the Hub has a small community pool compared to its market cap at just 0.41%.

Looking at other ecosystems similar to that of Cosmos, we can find Polkadot (DOT). Polkadot has a market cap of $6.7BN dollars with a treasury pool of roughly 38M DOT which equates to $230M. This figure equates to 3.4% of its total market cap. This large pool of funds is used to fund the growth of the ecosystem through grants, development funding and also community building.

On the Cosmos Hub these sorts of proposals are hard to come by due to the limited amount of funds of its community pool, and also social cost required to engage with the community. The ATOM 2.0 proposal suggested that a Treasury be created and be bootstrapped with 4M tokens at with every approved vote up to a maximum of 10 tranches. Ultimately the idea of initially minting 4M to the community pool came into the limelight. However, various community members were still uneasy about minting such an amount due to dilution effects.

The system as it is currently has its flaws but also works. Until consensus on that solution is found regarding the future of inflation and if / when ATOM becomes deflationary, we, **Simply Staking**, are proposing increasing the community pool tax from the current 2% to 10% as that will help bootstrap the community pool organically without too much compromise to inflationary yield.

## Community Pool Tax

Current rate of Issuance: 9.6ATOM per block according to x/mint

Current amount of blocks per year: 4,360,000

Instead of the current 0.192ATOM being transferred per block to the pool with the 2% tax, with a tax rate set at 10% we would see around 11,460 ATOM per day (0.96 ATOM per block) get moved to the community pool. Over a year this would allocate around ~4.2M ATOM to the community pool.

## How will this increase affect staking rewards?

With every block, staking rewards are minted. A percentage of those rewards are diverted to the community pool and then the rest to the stakers. Increasing the tax rate from 2% to 10% will decrease the rewards that stakers will receive by around 8% (from roughly 21% right now to 19.4%)

The premise here is that the value generated by a strong community pool, public good funding and ecosystem development will vastly exceed the yearly single digit % loss in rewards by stakers.

453,"Signaling Proposal for stOSMO/OSMO (#833) Incentivised Pool

- By voting **YES** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their support for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to add stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the stOSMO/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.

stOSMO/OSMO (#833) is currently incentivized with STRD from the Stride Foundation, at a rate of 10,000 STRD per day. The Stride Foundation will continue incentivizing this pool for the foreseeable future.

If approved, OSMO incentives to the stOSMO pool would increase liquidity depth, allowing the pool to function as a stable oracle for the price of stOSMO and absorb stOSMO liquidations. If liquidity is deep enough, stOSMO will likely be a collateral option for these coming Osmosis applications: Mars, Membrane, Margined, and Levana. In addition, many applications throughout the Cosmos will likely use stOSMO as collateral - if the stOSMO pool is deep enough.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride has a huge emphasis on security, with a minimalist blockchain, rate limiting, and continual auditing. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations. As Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis, it makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the stOSMO pool to the set of incentivized pools.

Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRtR7qkeaZCpCzHDwHgJeJAZdTrbmHLxFDYXhw7RoF1pp

The Cosmos Hub's state machine handles spam prevention of governance proposals by means of a deposit system. A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders’ time having to review the proposal).

In the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.

We instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If >33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors.  This proposal does not make any change to the current behavior for proposals that fail to meet quorum; if a proposal fails to meet quorum its deposit will be burned.",0

507,"Inflation Rate Change Correction

The purpose of changing the network’s inflation rate is to protect it from unbonding shocks that threaten to compromise the security of the network. When the bonded ratio gets below the goal bonded ratio (currently at 66% on the hub) the inflation rate & effective yield of staked atoms goes up in order to incentivize holders to bond new ATOM’s, providing additional security to the network. Inversely, if we regain a desired amount of staked tokens, the yield will drop, decreasing effective yields for all delegators. Ideally the inflation rate starts changing fast, optimizing network security over monetary hardness. To figure out what an appropriate selection for the cosmos hub would be, I created excel sheets to run through all the different scenarios to find what value made the inflation rate react in an optimal manner. I came to the conclusion that 1 (AKA 100% per year is the maximum slope of the inflation curve) gave the most ideal characteristics, with the added benefit of simplifying the equation. I’ll give some examples on how it would react. Since unbonding is what we are protecting against, I will look at flash unbonds while the inflation rate is at the floor due to that being the #1 time of vulnerability.",0

CosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades

Community-spend proposal submitted by Ethan Frey (https://github.com/ethanfrey) of Confio UO (http://confio.tech/) and CosmWasm (https://www.cosmwasm.com)

-=-=-

Full proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC
Forum Post: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-cosmwasm-on-cosmos-hub/3629

-=-=-

Amount to spend from the community pool: 25000 ATOMs

Timeline: 2-4 months from approval

Deliverables:
1. Adding governance control to all aspects of the CosmWasm contract lifecycle to make it compatible with the hub. Allowing governance to control code upload, contract instantiation, upgrades, and destruction (if needed).
2. Adding ability to upgrade contracts along with migrations (also allowing orderly shutdowns). This controlled by a governance vote.
3. Launch a testnet with working version of this code (Cosmos SDK 0.38 or 0.39) to enable all interested parties to trial the process and provide feedback.
4. Provide sample contracts to demo on the testnet, along with some migration scenarios

Within 2 months, the working code and binaries should be delivered and open for public review. Within 4 months, these binaries will be used on a testnet, with sufficient staking tokens given to all active voters on the Cosmos Hub, and we will go through a few governance voting cycles to trial contract deployment and migrations (with a shorter voting cycles, eg. 3 days)

Detailed milestones in the full proposal:
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC

Beyond the milestones, CosmWasm will enhance documentation of the platform and offer technical support on our Telegram channel.

-=-=-

_Problem_
With the upcoming launch of IBC, the hub will need to adapt more rapidly to the needs of the ecosystem, while also limiting chain restarts, which may be detrimental to IBC connections. In particular support for relaying Dynamic IBC Protocols and Rented Security, using ATOMs as collateral for smaller zones, would greatly benefit from CosmWasm's flexibility.

_Solution_
We’re adding some key features to CosmWasm to convert it from a permissionless, immutable smart contract platform to a permissioned platform with governance control for upgrading or shutting down contracts. This is a key requirement to be able to integrate CosmWasm to the Cosmos Hub with minimal disruption.

_Future_
We will continue development of CosmWasm, especially adding IBC integration as well as working towards a stable 1.0 release that can be audited and safely deployed (Q3/Q4 2020).

HackAtom VI is the biggest Hackatom in Cosmos history.  Osmosis, a core contributor to the Cosmos ecosystem, should participate as a sponsor to this event given that Osmosis originally started as the winning project of HackAtom V.

This is a proposal for the Osmosis Community Pool to allocate 50,000 USD to participate as a challenge sponsor to HackAtom VI.  A HackAtom sponsorship allows Osmosis governance to propose a hackathon challenge in one of the existing categories and use the full 50,000 USD sponsorship as prize pool money to pay the winners of the Osmosis challenge.  Examples of challenges from other projects can be found on the HackAtom website here:  https://hackatom.org 

The Osmosis challenge should be open-ended, giving builders the flexibility to explore their ideas and build something outstanding.  For that reason, we propose that the Osmosis challenge to be:  

“Build something cool with Osmosis. Bonus points if you incorporate ION.”

A YES vote on this proposal signals an agreement to allocate 50,000 USD from the community pool as HackAtom VI challenge prize sponsorship by the Osmosis community.

Should this proposal pass, a follow-through community pool spend proposal will be submitted on December 17, 2021 (with the USD value to be decided based on the closing price of OSMO on December 16, 2021) to distribute the prizes to the winners of the Osmosis challenge. 

The prize distribution will be managed by Tendermint Inc, the organizers of HackAtom VI.

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt gaia v6.0.0 which includes a number of updates, fixes and new modules. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.

### Background

Since the last upgrade at height 6910000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint. The following updates are included in gaia v6.0.0:
 * Bump [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.44.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) which notably includes fixes for the vesting accounts and two new modules outlined below. For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21)
     * Add the [authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. `x/authz` is an implementation of a Cosmos SDK module, per [ADR 30](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.3/docs/architecture/adr-030-authz-module.md), that allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). Authorizations must be granted for a particular Msg service method one by one using an implementation of the `Authorization` interface.
     * Add the [feegrant](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/feegrant/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. This module allows accounts to grant fee allowances and to use fees from their accounts. Grantees can execute any transaction without the need to maintain sufficient fees.
     * **NOTICE** It's imortant to highlight [PR #10041](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/10041) which impacts **WALLETS AND EXCHANGES**. This update has removed the deprecated the legacy REST endpoints for broadcast & encode. **This means `POST /tx` and `POST /txs/encode` no longer work**. Please see the [REST Endpoints Migration guide](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/migrations/rest.html) to migrate to the new REST endpoints.
 * Add [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) as a standalone module from the Cosmos SDK using version [v2.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). See the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md) for details.
     * Please note that the governance parameter for `MaxExpectedBlockDelay` is set to 30 seconds. This means if a connection is opened with a packet delay of 1 minute, it requires 2 blocks to be committed after the consensus state is submitted before the packet can be processed.
 * Add [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) [v1.0.1](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v1.0.1) as per [Proposal #56](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/56) prepared and tested by [Strangelove Ventures](https://www.strangelove.ventures/). This feature allows multi-hop IBC transfer messages so that a user can send tokens from chain A to chain C via chain B.
 * Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity) module to [v1.4.2](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.4.2) to ensure compatibility with Cosmos-SDK.

### Ready for Production

These changes have been extensively tested by various Cosmos Core Contributor teams including [Hypha Co-Op](https://hypha.coop/), [Informal Systems Co-Op](https://informal.systems/), [Interchain GmbH](https://interchain.berlin/), [Regen Network](https://regen.network/), [Strangelove Ventures](https://strangelove.ventures/), [Tendermint Inc](https://tendermint.com/) and more. The release candidate for this update was run as a local testnet and a public testnet with a successful upgrade; documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test).

### On-Chain Upgrade Process

When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor) to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Instructions specific to the upgrade can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/gaia-tutorials/upgrade-node.md). To test a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test/blob/master/local-testnet/README.md). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.

Stargate is our name for the process of ensuring that the widely integrated public network known as the Cosmos Hub is able to execute the cosmoshub-3 -> cosmoshub-4 upgrade with the minimum disruption to its existing ecosystem. This upgrade will also realize the Internet of Blockchains vision from the Cosmos whitepaper.
Integrations from ecosystem partners are at risk of breaking changes due to the Stargate changes. These changes drive the need for substantial resource and time requirements to ensure successful migration. Stargate represents a unique set of circumstances and is not intended to set precedent for future upgrades which are expected to be less dramatic.
There is a widespread consensus from many Cosmos stakeholders that these changes to core software components will enhance the performance and composability of the software and the value of the Cosmos Hub in a world of many blockchains.
A Yes result on this proposal provides a clear signal that the Cosmos Hub accepts and understands the Stargate process and is prepared to approve an upgrade with proposed changes if the plan below is executed successfully.
A No result would force a reconsideration of the tradeoffs in the Alternatives section and the forming a new plan to deliver IBC.

552,"⚛️  Add IBC Router to Hub ⚛️

The Hub has long been envisioned as a central point in the IBC architecture. In the battle to build and ship IBC this central vision has remained unchanged, but with so much focus on the need to build out other zones with real economies to support this network (the CosmosSDK is the result of this effort), the idea of the hub as an Interchain Router hasn't been discussed in a serious context for quite a while.

This is understandable: Cosmos needed so many other pieces to come together before the Hub had a chance to even start performing this function. Those other zones have been created, they each have products and economies. The bootstrapping era of IBC is well underway.

These new zones joining are noticing a problem: they need to maintain a large amount of infrastructure (archive nodes and relayers for each counterparty chain) to connect with all the chains in the ecosystem, a number that is continuing to increase quickly.

Luckly this problem has been anticipated and IBC architected to accomodate multi-hop transactions. However, a packet forwarding/routing feature was not in the initial IBC release. This proposal aims to fix this for the Hub.

This is a proposal to include a new feature to IBC on the Hub that allows for multi-hop packet routing for ICS20 transfers. By appending an intermediate address, and the port/channel identifiers for the final destination, clients will be able to outline more than one transfer at a time.

Strangelove Ventures has delivered an [IBC Middleware module](https: //github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/373) that will allow the hub to play the role of IBC Router that was always envisioned for it. Passing of this propsal will begin the era of the Hub offering interchain services to other chains and profiting from those relationships.

To pay the hub validators and stakers, this proposal implements a governance configurable fee (which we propose should be initially set to 0.0 to encourage adoption) that will be taken out of each packet and given to the community pool. The community pool will then periodically trade these fees for ATOM and distribute them to staked holders. The exact distribution method of these fees is left TBD in this proposal as it is not initially required and can be implemented in a future governance proposal. One way to do this would be using the [Groups module](https: //docs.cosmos.network/master/architecture/adr-042-group-module.html), Community spend proposals and the Gravity DEX.

A vote YES on this proposal indicates that this feature should be included in the next hub upgrade. We (as the Hub) believe that time is critical right now and we cannot wait to begin providing this service to other chains. A NO vote indicates that this shouldn't be included in the next upgrade.

Event Highlights
Cosmoverse is organized by the community, for the community. We managed to onboard reputable speakers from the Cosmos ecosystem, such as Sunny Aggarwal, Billy Rennekamp, Alessio Treglia, Federico Kunze-Küllmer, Brent Xu, Gregory Landua or Felix Lutsch, but also high-profile speakers from the broader Cryptoverse such as Meltem Demirors, Tegan Kline, Marc Zeller and more.

As we get closer to the event, we will try to embed more exciting things that will make Cosmoverse a great success. Follow us on Twitter and join the chat on Telegram to stay up-to-date and STAY TUNED :)


Budget & post-conference report

If this proposal passes, 4,000 OSMO (worth ~ $20,000 as of today according to Coingecko) will be allocated to help make this event a great success.

The lead sponsor for the conference is the Cosmos Hub with marketing funds from proposal #46 “Luna Mission,” but we require additional resources to pay for:
Audio visuals / logistics
Day 2 venue + catering

Afterparty
Printing banners
Marketing materials
Online marketing and coverage
We are going to publish a detailed report on the budget-spent after the conference occurred. Given that Cosmoverse was just an idea ~5 weeks ago and things are moving incredibly fast, the cost and budget planning is one of the hardest tasks for us at the moment.

In addition, given that we are just a team of 6-enthusiastic Cosmonauts without a company that could bail us out, we need to be incredibly cautious with our finances and avoid illiquidity.

The main cost-factors for this event (for 320 people) are:
Venue incl. catering: ~ $36,500 per day
AV + branding: ~ $34,200 total
Afterparty: ~ $20,000
Additional expenses: tbd
Team expenses: tbd
Team compensation: tbd

The cost for the venue would increase by ~$19,000 per day if we could host 500 guests instead of 320.

In case there is going to be a profit left, we plan to use this as starting liquidity for the next Cosmoverse conference.

Current sponsors are:
Cosmos Hub community pool ($34,000)
Citizen Cosmos ($5,000)
Stargaze ($5,000)
Sentinel ($5,000)
Regen Network ($5,000)
Umee ($5,000)
e-Money ($5,000)
Commercio ($5,000)

Cosmoverse is a community-effort that is financed in a hybrid manner by companies and DAOs. The first one ever? In the future, we envision Cosmoverse to become a fully DAO-funded endeavor that will take place annually.


Tickets
The goal is also to keep the ticket prices extremely affordable (from 39€) which is very competitive to other crypto-conferences happening in Lisbon around the same time (tickets cost up to €1,000). The ticket also includes F&B throughout both days at the conference as well as access and F&B at the afterparty venue. Our goal is to provide as much value as possible for attending Cosmonauts, while also investing funds into media coverage to provide high-quality, free broadcasting of the event. Each presentation will also be recorded and published on Youtube.

The Osmosis core team has been an early proponent and supporter of Cosmoverse and is also receiving exposure at the event.
If the proposal is accepted, Osmosis will become a sponsor of Cosmoverse 2021.

This includes:
Online and print visibility
Keynote slot on Day 1 (presentation by Josh Lee)
Panel slot on Day 2 (topic + panelists tbd)
1x high table at the conference in the exhibition area
1x stand up banner placed in the networking area

558,"Canonical Ethereum Bridge Provider: Approval Voting Procedures & Reciprocal Expectations for Bridge Provision

Voting YES to this Proposal means that you assent to using the following procedures to vote for a Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider (BSP) for app.osmosis.zone, a relationship whose initial, mutable expectations are outlined below.\n\nVoting NO means you do not assent to these procedures and expectations. VETO and ABSTAIN have their normal functions.\n\nLIMITATION OF SCOPE: A YES vote assents to these procedures ONLY for the series of five Osmosis governance proposals outlined below. To guard against malicious or confusing proposals, only proposals made by osmo19mywfjzj324w5ukf7ss6jak0dg9hnljfp0rfx4 will be considered under these rules. Future use of these (or similar) procedures must be separately approved by governance.\n\nAPPROVAL VOTING PROCEDURES: Five Osmosis Governance Proposals will be proposed under these rules, one each for the four bridge service providers being voted upon: 1) Axelar, 2) Gravity Bridge, 3) Nomad, and 4) Wormhole, as well as 5) a “do nothing” proposal.\n\nWINNER: The Bridge Service Provider (BSP) proposal (or “do nothing”) from this set that receives the highest total amount of YES voting power at the end of the collective voting period will win, provided that QUORUM is reached and a RUN-OFF is not activated. That BSP will enter into a relationship with Osmosis DAO whose initial parameters are outlined below.\n\nNO, NO WITH VETO, and ABSTAIN votes will have NO EFFECT on the tally of yes voting power for the approval voting results. In other words, a bridge could win the approval vote even if it has more NO/VETO vote power than YES, as long as it has the most YES voting power among the BSP proposals.\n\nQUORUM: As long as the total YES voting power received across the 5 approval voting proposals is equivalent to regular Osmosis quorum (20% of total Osmosis voting power), quorum will be considered to have been reached.\n\nRUN-OFF: At the end of the collective voting period, any BSP or “do nothing” proposal that has received within 15% of the leading proposal’s total will be entered into a run-off governed by these same rules and expectations, except that the run-off result will be final, with no further run-offs. This 15% will be measured as a percentage of the total voting power available on Osmosis for this set of proposals (NOT 15% of the top vote-getter’s YES voting power).\nFor example, assuming 122M total staked OSMO available to vote, the 15% run-off spread is 18.3M. Therefore, if Bridge X gets 53M YES voting power, Bridge Y gets 35M, and Bridge Z gets 25M, Bridges X and Y will be entered into a run-off.\n\nBRIDGE SERVICE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP EXPECTATIONS:\nThe Osmosis DAO is asking Osmosis Labs to integrate the BSP into app.osmosis.zone to provide canonical, unprefixed bridged assets from Ethereum. The implementation details will be left to Osmosis Labs and the chosen BSP, but the general shape of the initial expectations is as follows. These expectations are subject to change as circumstance, future governance, and social consensus dictate.\n\nFrom Osmosis, the BSP can expect:\nDefault Asset List – the Ethereum assets bridged by the selected provider will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone default asset list – i.e. their bridged ETH and ERC-20 assets will be ETH, USDC, etc., all other bridges' assets would be bridge1ETH, bridge2USDC, and the like. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions. In the near future, we expect custom token lists to become the norm in Cosmos, as they are on Ethereum, so that users can search for and import tokens that they want to interact with.\nOsmosis Incentives – the DAO commits to prioritizing the assets of the canonical bridge, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools–under the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.\nIntegration – Osmosis expects to work closely with the BSP. At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).\n\nFrom the BSP, Osmosis can expect:\nIntegration / Availability – the BSP will help optimize integrations in a timely manner in accordance with Osmosis’ stated goals of achieving deposits and withdrawals from the app.osmosis.zone UI and Keplr Wallet (without pass-through to the bridge UI).\nLiquidity Mining Incentives – if a project’s proposal included the promise of incentives (e.g. Axelar, at least 1% of Axelar tokens to be used for incentives on Osmosis).\n\nRevocability / At-will / Permissionless: As noted, these expectations are preliminary and subject to change as the DAO, developers, and the bridge team see fit. Osmosis DAO and the BSP will be working with each other for their mutual benefit, without contractual promise or obligation. It will be up to the BSP team to maintain a good relationship with Osmosis Labs regarding the front-end implementation details. Osmosis DAO empowers Osmosis Labs to change BSPs if in their estimation, the relationship has become unworkable, or the technical landscape suggests a superior solution, subject to ratification by the DAO.\nShould the arrangement become unworkable for either party for whatever reason, the arrangement can be changed or terminated without notice. Any damages for bad behavior (broken promises, bridge failures) will be to reputation alone. Specific promises between the BSP and an individual user (e.g. bridge insurance) are not covered by this disclaimer, nor are potential future agreements between the DAO and various developers, teams, or individuals.\n\nFurther details and discussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4482-osmosis-canonical-ethereum-bridge-proposals",0
559,"Add WBNB to the list of Major category assets

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding WBNB to the list of assets that receive incentives as a Major token.\n\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to adding WBNB to the list of assets that receive incentives as a Major token.\n\n**Details**\nBNB is currently the rank 4 cryptocurrency by marketcap with a valuation of around 8 Billion, 80 times higher than Osmosis. WBNB is the wrapped version of this able to be used in Binance Smart Chain DeFi.\nThe majority of trade volume happens on centralised exchanges and not on Osmosis.\nThis proposal asks if Osmosis has a strategic interest in attracting more liquidity of WBNB and so will enable it to access a greater proportion of liquidity incentives.\n\n**About WBNB**\nWBNB is the wrapped version of BNB and is the most liquid, volatile asset across Binance Smart Chain DeFi. WBNB currently arrives on Osmosis via the Axelar bridge.\nBNB is used to pay for goods and services on Binance, settle transaction fees on Binance Smart Chain, participate in exclusive token sales and more.\nWebsite: [https://www.binance.com/en/bnb](https://www.binance.com/en/bnb)\n\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7507-onboarding-of-new-major-token-pool-osmowbnb](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7507-onboarding-of-new-major-token-pool-osmowbnb)",0

563,"Double the block gas limits

This proposal increases the block gas limit to 120M, from the existing 60M. 

We are currently frequently hitting block gas limits, even though the native execution times remain quite low. We see that we're frequently getting 10-20 trades per block, with block's nearing the gas limit. (Due to several affects, not just low gas limit, but the gas limit is still a part of it)

Furthermore, the bonding & unbonding of LP shares for yield farming still takes a lot of gas, even though its fixed in the subsequent chain software version. Bonding of LP shares is nearing 30M gas per tx (until the next upgrade). For unbonding it depends on how many locks its trying to unbond at once. (~25M each atm) Increasing the limit should improve UX, without notably increasing the block times. In the future, if we find that we're getting into execution time limits per block, we should start tuning per-tx gas parameters and optimizing the code to improve these speeds. The chain should _absolutely_ be able to support 100+ trades per block, and we need our gas limits to be able to reflect this. I propose that only if the chain starts seeing too high of an execution time per block, and a software patch would take too long, do we start tuning down the block gas limit.",0

567,"Add Incentive Matching to Prop 13 Model

I propose that we extend the model currently used for semi-automatic incentive adjustments to include an Incentive Matching program, where we match external incentives paid to liquidity pools on Osmosis. Such as the previous program by Akash, current one by E-Money, and proposed one by Juno https://juno.aneka.io/proposals/1\n\nUnder the current process, new pool creators are asked to create Text Proposals so that we can come to consensus about whether or not these pools should begin receiving Osmo incentives following the Prop 13 model and on-boarding process.\n\nUnder the proposed new process, pool creators would create Text Proposals asking for governance agreement to add the pools to the model, but also to match a certain amount of external incentives that they plan to provide. For an approved pool with external incentives, the model would set a minimum incentive share with Osmo to match the USD value of the external incentives.\n\nThese incentive matches would be decided by governance on a case by case basis, and should be limited to some overall % of Osmo Incentives. I propose that we start with a soft limit of 20% of incentives, so matching no more than ~400,000 USD per day of external incentives.\n\nI also propose that we begin by matching the external incentives currently being paid by E-Money to pools 461, and 482. As well as the proposed Juno incentives on pools 497, and 498. These external incentives amount to a total of ~36,000 USD per day, or 1.9% of incentives at current prices.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, we will begin using the new spreadsheet for regular adjustment proposals starting October 11th 2021, and these pools will have their external incentives at least matched.\n\nIf this proposal is not approved, we will continue with the Prop 13 model without matching. As Juno pools are already approved for incentives, they will begin on-boarding regardless of which outcome is decided here.\n\nCurrent Spreadsheet:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15-b7o4QHY4SNE7Cw6MSZZ9Xxxbwca_hw4coLN9Y2ZFM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nProposed Spreadsheet:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ruG_ZypTPZ9myr2ov5atclfCNRTPGoMYbStYqnVcf1c/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThis spreadsheet implements the proposed changes.

569,"A Grant Program for the Cosmos Hub: Funding the ATOM Accelerator DAO



<B>Summary</B> 

With a properly funded community pool (following prop 88), we believe it is the right time to launch one or more grant programs to serve community contributors and builders around the Hub. 
This is a community spending proposal seeking approval to fund 588,000 ATOMs for the ATOM Accelerator DAO Grant Program.

<I>Note:</I> The program was formerly referenced as Cosmos Hub Grant Program (CHGP) and Orbital DAO.

<B>Grant Program Overview</B> 

With the ATOM Accelerator DAO, we seek to boost community participation and unlock its collective intelligence by encouraging individual and team-based initiatives. 
The ATOM Accelerator DAO offers an alternative, native source of funding for the Cosmos Hub and removes some of the burden on public governance. 
This program has more funding flexibility and also allows proactive allocation of capital through the development of in-house investment themes in collaboration with the community.

Grants will focus on open source code, public goods, and ecosystem initiatives that create value for ATOM holders.

The existing Hub issues that can be solved through this program are:
 - Insufficient funding of public goods;
 - Idle capital in the community pool;
 - Growth risk aversion;
 - Low support of teams already growing the Hub; and
 - Losing developers to other L1s.

The grant program solves these problems through:
 - Liaising between decentralized teams;
 - Minimizing risk through due diligence;
 - Supporting teams already growing the Hub;
 - Bringing new developers to the Hub and;
 - Efficiently deploying capital to ensure R&D & growth at the Hub.

<B>The Team</B> 

<B>A. Reviewer Committee</B> 
A team of 7 will be on the Reviewer Committee in charge of allocating grants. These 7 people will each play a functional role on the team, with the goal of creating a high-performance team, and also will steward the Multisig ensuring accountability in the approval of grants.  

<B>- Program Manager:</B> <a href=""https://twitter.com/youssef_amrani"">Youssef Amrani </a>. Core contributor Cosmos Hub, Economic Committee of IST stablecoin, previously community analyst at Messari. To lead program structuring, strategy & outreach

The Reviewer Committee will be supported by a Program Coordinator, <a href=""https://twitter.com/The_BendyOne"">Ben Davis </a>, who brings 15 years of digital marketing experience and will assist with website, marketing, community and program processes.

<B>B. Oversight Committee</B>
The Oversight, Accountability & Transparency Committee represents an opportunity to raise the bar and improve trust within the community. Oversight and accountability have often proved to be missing pieces in blockchain governance. That is why we want to adopt an innovative approach where there is an oversight and accountability function built in from day one as an integral part of the grant program and not something that would be implemented ad hoc. 
By establishing a flow of information about workings and status of Atom Accelerator DAO Grant Program, the entire Cosmos community can then be in a position to evaluate the efficacy of the program.  The Oversight team consists of three members: 

<B>Senior:</B> <a href=""https://twitter.com/mrjasonchoi"">Jason Choi </a>:  Founder of angel investing collective Tangent. Hosts the popular Blockcrunch podcast. Formerly General Partner at Spartan Capital.

<B>Auditor/Controller:</B>  <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricia-mizuki-b6334a5a/"">Patricia Mizuki </a>, formerly PwC auditor, over 10 years in audit, risk management and process improvements.

<B> Coordinator:</B>  Recruiting underway

<B>TIMEFRAME</B>

Here are the different steps we envision for the implementation and bootstrapping of the ATOM Accelerator DAO Grant Program:

<B>- Months 0-2:</B> set up the organization, create the program & workflows, setup website and proposal intake system, and build-up social media presence

<B>- Months 2-9:</B> Grant program in full steam, proposals are coming in, being reviewed, and being funded, and most of the budget is assigned to grants

<B>- End of Month 9:</B> Oversight committee to produce the grant program end of mandate report
Following the grant program end of mandate report, the community can either (a) Maintain confidence in the team behind the grant program and renew the mandate, or (b) Terminate the program, in which case unspent funds are returned to the community pool

<B>OUR STRENGTHS</B>

The strengths of our program are as follows:
Experienced & special-purpose team
Oversight function for community transparency
Support a plurality of grant-programs and can liaise and coordinate effectively
Primary goal to drive value for ATOM

Recipient: cosmos1jggracsvp6fkw0ktf544lpda6dwrrxggx9a20n

<B>Amount</B>

588,000 ATOMs

<B>Note on Amount</B>

The amount of ATOM requested represents less than 2 months of community pool replenishment rate following prop 88 which increases the tax from 2 to 10%.

570,"Set Initial Liquidity Mining Incentives

This proposal provides initial incentives for pools.\n\nIt sets the initial distribution of incentives allocation points. It allocates 5% of the LP incentives to the community pool.\n\nThe rest is based upon the current TVL for each pool. ATOM/OSMO has the most liquidity, so we have it at 25%. For the remaining pools, we split the incentives evenly between the ATOM and OSMO pools. The AKT pools have the next most liquidity, so we add them at 25% total, split between the two 12.5% pools. After that is the XPRT pools, so its 20%, split across both. Then DVPN at 15%. Not much liquidity has arrived for IRIS or CRO, so we set them to 4% of the allocation points each.  Finally, we allocated 2% to these ION things…  Whatever they are…\n\nOsmosis has capabilites for incentivizing passive liquidity. Correspondingly, 80% of the allocation points are dedicated to people who bond their LP shares for at least 1 day. 15% who bond for at least 7 days, and 5% for those who bond at least 14 days. (So if you bond for 14 days, you get the rewards for 1 day, 7 day, and 14 day)",0

# Juno Security Upgrade CWA-2021-003\n\nA critical security vulnerability has been found on wasmvm 0.13.x, 0.14.x, 0.15.x, 0.16.x and 1.x ([link](https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2021-003.md)) **user funds are not at risk** but this could lead to a chain halt and consensus break.\n\nA patch for this security breach will be released with juno v2.2.x.\n\nThis signaling governance proposal is to amend the software version specified on [proposal #9](https://lcd-archive.junonetwork.io/gov/proposals/9) from v2.1.x to v2.2.x. \n\nIn this way we can upgrade the chain in one time and have both moneta-patch and security patch live as quickly as possible.\n\n## Notes\n\n1. v2.2.0 is consensus breaking against v2.1.0, so it's very important that super-majority of validators runs correct version.\n2. Validators can follow the previousily shared instructions for the upgrade, but using the new version of the software.\n3. This proposal will still be in voting period during and after the upgrade. This doesn't really affect the upgrade process, but in case of rejection of this proposal validators should coordinate to cancel the upgrade or run the previous agreed version of the software.\n",0
573,"Implement A Minimum Gas Price of 0.0025 uOSMO on Osmosis

Vote YES on this proposal to signal that you support implementation of a minimum gas price of 0.0025 uOSMO on Osmosis at the protocol level.\n\nVote NO on this proposal to signal that you do not support implementation of a minimum gas price of 0.0025 uOSMO on Osmosis at the protocol level.\n\n**Details**\nCurrently, Osmosis has no protocol-level minimum gas price. The reasoning for this is that the vast majority of OSMO liquidity is on Osmosis, making it difficult for new users to acquire elsewhere to carry out their first transaction. Allowing Osmosis users to submit transactions with a transaction fee of 0 has made it extremely easy for new users to onboard into Osmosis by enabling them to transact on Osmosis for the first time without having the native gas token. \n\nAt the same time, however, setting a minimum gas price of 0 leaves Osmosis vulnerable to denial of service attacks executed via the spamming of free transactions on the network. While thankfully Osmosis has not experienced a major DoS or DDoS event to date, incidences of recurring transaction spam have been increasing.\n\nWith a recent upgrade, Keplr now offers Osmosis users the ability to pay transaction fees on Osmosis in non-OSMO assets (for example, gas can now be paid in ATOM). While the ability to do this has existed on the Osmosis chain for quite some time, this wallet upgrade has opened the door to a large number of onboarding routes into Osmosis for all users on the main front-end for the very first time. Similarly, Osmosis’s Binance listing has made it much easier for new users to purchase OSMO off-chain to use as a transaction fee if necessary.\n\nAs such, the time is ripe to implement a minimum transaction fee on Osmosis. The purpose of this proposal is to signal to Osmosis Labs and other key Osmosis development contributors that governance mandates a minimum gas price of 0.0025 uOSMO be implemented at the protocol level. There is currently no governance adjustable parameter to implement this fee, so this proposal will be implemented in a subsequent software upgrade.\n\nFurther, to the extent that fees need to be priced via the Transaction Fee Module in another asset, the transaction fee module should be amended to utilize Osmosis Time Weighted Average Pricing over at least a 24 hour period instead of the currently utilized spot pricing to ensure that validators are fairly compensated no matter which asset is used for fees\n\nFull discussion on this proposal can be found here: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level)",0

578,"Match External Incentives for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pairs

** Background **

As established in Osmosis Proposal #47: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47, the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

MED liquidity pools have been listed on Osmosis since 23 Nov 2021.
A signaling proposal for promoting MED pools to Incentivized Pools has been passed: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/78. According to the signaling proposal, the UpdatePoolIncentives proposal is in its voting period: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/79.


** Proposal Details **

This is a proposal to allocate ~$900,000-worth MEDs for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pools on Osmosis to be provided by MediBloc.
Also, this proposes for the Osmosis community to launch the Incentive Matching program for MED pools.
This helps increase liquidity and most importantly ensures that the price slippage can be reduced.

By voting YES on this proposal, external MED incentives will be matched at ~$5,000-worth MEDs per pool per day for 90 days.
By voting NO on this proposal, external MED incentives will NOT be matched at ~$5,000-worth MEDs per pool per day for 90 days.

The MediBloc has prepared 12,222,725 MED which is approximately equivalent to $900,000 based on the average market closing price for the last 7 days as of 26 Nov 2021 (according to the historical data of CoinMarketCap).

The MED incentives for each MED pool will be the following:
- MED/OSMO (Pool #586): ~67,904 MED per day for 90 days (~$5,000 approximately)
- MED/ATOM (Pool #587): ~67,904 MED per day for 90 days (~$5,000 approximately)

All MED used for these liquidity incentives will be matched with an equal value of OSMO incentives if this proposal is passed by the Osmosis community.

These will be split up into the following buckets for each bonding period:
- 1-day bonding: 8,488 MED/day
- 7-day bonding: 25,464 MED/day
- 14-day bonding: 33,952 MED/day",0

All funds above the 93k$ price mark will be refunded to the Community pool as soon as the audit has been paid in full.
Those funds will NEVER go to any of the personal or professional wallets of those people/organizations. They will ONLY be used to pay for the platform audit.

* Voting YES for this proposal will adjust the deposit required for a proposal to enter the voting period to 1600 OSMO.

* Voting NO for this proposal will keep the deposit required for a proposal to enter the voting period at 500 OSMO.

**Details**
The current deposit for a governance proposal is 500 OSMO, worth approximately $500 in the current market.
This was last adjusted in [Proposal 16](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/16) to align with the value of the deposit to propose on the Cosmos Hub. At the time this had a market value of $860.
1600 OSMO has a current market value of approximately $1650 and represents a more significant penalty to discourage spam proposals such as [Proposal 277](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/277).

Deposits may be filled by more than one party using the command line or wallet interfaces, such as [Commonwealth](https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposals) and [ping.pub](https://ping.pub/osmosis/gov), to ensure that the community is not priced out of governance.

Governance participants should regularly re-evaluate this parameter against OSMO price to ensure it is an appropriate spam deterrent whilst also being accessible.

586,"Increase Governance Proposal Minimum Deposit

# Proposal Deposit Concept :-
* For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be submitted with a deposit of the amount defined by the **min_deposit** param in the governance module before the deposit end time.
* A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.
* The proposer account is only required to deposit **1 JUNO**.

# Deposit Refund and Burn Concept :-
* If the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount.
* If the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4%) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.

# Proposition :-
By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit costs **500 JUNO** or approximately **1,500** in **USD** equivalent, which currently appears to be inadequate at preventing spam proposals. Historically, the cost of submitting a governance proposal into voting period has been much higher to deter spam proposals.

With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to **1000 JUNO** or approximately **3,000** in **USD** equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance.

# Voting :-
* By voting **YES**, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 500 JUNO to 1000 JUNO.
* By voting **NO**, you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements.
* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
* By voting **NOWITHVETO**, you seek penalizing the proposal depositors by burning their deposit of 500 JUNO, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold, which would result in proposal failure if reached.

HackJuno Türkiye

Summary:

HackJuno Turkey has emerged as the dream of a group of people and communities that have proven themselves in the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem. Educational institutions -Universities- and other Blockchain-Web3 communities in the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem, especially 0xWilds (Blockchain Ecosystem), Castrum Istanbul (Next Generation Blockchain Ecosystem), Tabellio (Developer Team in Cosmos Ecosystem), Nova Ratio Labs (Cosmos Developer Team) HackJuno Turkey, which we plan to realize under the leadership of, stands out with its ""GameFi,"" ""Game to Awareness"" and ""Social Responsibility"" points, unlike other Blockchain, Based Hackhatkons. We have three main topics that we will consider as Hackathon content; DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi.

Goal:

As the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem, our primary purpose in wanting to realize the ""HackJuno Turkey Hackathon"" event is to introduce the Cosmos network, especially the Juno Ecosystem, to the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem and market because many projects that we can develop with the Cosmos and Juno ecosystem will bring us to the forefront in the international and national sense, especially the Blockchain and Web3 communities in Turkey.

Social Responsibility:

Our aim on this path, which we set out with the motto of awareness, is to create and shape the motivation of potential web3 developers while organizing a hackathon. The ""Turkey Inter-University E-sports Tournament,"" which is among the events we will collect in parallel with the ""HackJuno Turkey"" hackathon, also carries a social responsibility purpose with the training we will give to the tournament participants at the workshops. Bringing potential talent and creators from Blockchain, Web3, and GameFi into the ecosystem is one of our main objectives at this event.

Why are we different from other Hackathons?

The main thing that will make HackJuno Turkey different from other Hackathons is education and awareness. As we mentioned in our primary purpose, we aim to create value for the ecosystem without making any profit in this event; Thanks to this value, we aim to make a material and moral contribution to the Turkish Blockchain Ecosystem.

# Overview

[Original Cosmos Forum Post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-21-interchain-info-hub-funding/9822)
[IPFS Version](https://sparkibc.s3.filebase.com/InterchainInfo/Hub%20Funding%20Prop%20for%20ICI.pdf)

Built by Spark IBC, Interchain Info (ICI) is a truly multi-chain & chain-agnostic hub for information and tooling to make navigating the rapidly growing Interchain easier for both new and old users alike. At Spark IBC, we believe that, currently, “Cosmos” and the greater Interchain are extremely fragmented, as communities, educational resources, NFT collections, Dapps and tools each reside in their own remote corners of the ecosystem.

ICI aims to change this by taking the first step toward building the unified, multi-chain future that the community has been waiting for, and that we believe is paramount to Cosmos gaining mass adoption in the next market cycle. We are currently running an ICI funding campaign on the Spark IBC platform, found here, [https://sparkibc.zone](https://sparkibc.zone) 4 along with more details about ICI itself.

We are avoiding VCs and private investors in this endeavor, because ICI is only a valuable resource if it remains unbiased and beholden to no one but the community that uses it. Therefore, all ICI costs so far have come out of our own pockets, and going forwards, we're raising funds entirely through grants and donations from users and community pools.

## Request

We request 1% of community pool funds, capped at $20,000 from a number of chains, including The Cosmos Hub, to contribute to The ICI Campaign on Spark IBC. For The Hub, this makes our total ask ~$20k or 1,438 ATOM at the time of writing.

If passed,

- 50% of issued funds will be donated directly to ICI for general development, hosting and maintenance, to be used alongside other funding sources like private contributions done through the Spark platform.
- The remaining 50% will be used as incentives for community members to create and submit content about general cosmos tech. For other chains, this 50% is reserved for content about stuff built in that chains ecosystem, but since the Hub is positioned a bit differently, we think it's match made in heaven to direct these funds towards content on things like IBC, CosmWasm, the Cosmos SDK, etc.
- For The Hub, this amounts to ~20k USD in Atom total, which is about 1,438 ATOM, which will then be split 50/50 as outlined above.

Each network that approves funding will be rewarded with Spark Points based on their full donation amount and a customized entry on our leaderboard labeled “[chain name] Community.” Spark Points are used within the Spark IBC system to recognize users for their contributions to the Interchain. In this case, there would be an entry made for “The Cosmos Hub Community” with 20k Spark Points.

One Spark Point is representative of one dollar (or USDC, or, in this case, token equivalent) donated, and is tracked through the soulbound $SPARK token on Juno Network. For these donations, Spark IBC will set up a wallet on Juno, or use the Bech32 converted version of the community pools address on Juno, label it accordingly on our leaderboard, and mint $SPARK equivalent to the USD value of the donated amount into it, measured by the price at the time of distribution. Slippage and fees for conversion will not be taken into account, as that's beyond the communities control.

One significant benefit of multi-chain projects is the unique ability to distribute our funding requests across different sources to minimize sell pressure and the burden on any single community pool/token. This sort of effort is something that Spark IBC plans to pioneer and offer as a potential service to any who use the Spark IBC platform for fundraising in future.

## Spending Details

### Base Contribution

In addition to the ICI info on SparkIBC.zone, we also have a rough breakdown of how funds will be spent given hitting certain funding tiers, found here 2
Link: [ICI Budget Outline for Initial Raise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GYFnJYozptojj3ytE_OYbo03inoQ1dEJxnHnmparWQ/edit#gid=0)

### Incentives Program

As stated, 50% of the requested $20k will be used exclusively to incentivize content related to general Cosmos tech & terminology on the Index and Resource hub. This allows community members and content creators the ability to earn a little income while contributing something beneficial to the entire interchain. It also ensures that a portion of the allotted funding amount returns to the community in a very direct way.

Note: the Spark & ICI Team reserve the right to deny payment, both pre/post-production, to anyone on the basis of content quality or attempts to manipulate this proposed system (i.e. needlessly long articles, videos, copy others existing work as a full new submission etc.); this is not a “trustless” incentive program. At this time, we will only accept English submissions meeting basic literary standards; however, we may expand this program to include other languages in the future and/or add a translation tier to the list of incentives below (we are open to feedback on these details):

[Submission outline](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/9/92c9a4e08b05afbc1cf46e0da69df8b0c827f1ee_2_450x500.png)

*$0.05/word (written content) and $5.00/min. (video content) are below industry standards, but the crux of this project is to further incentivize creators who are already producing original content, while refining and updating existing material that needs to constantly be updated. In its entirety, this project will both promote new material and provide house-keeping for fresh, up-to-date information in order to attract new ecosystem investors and users.

## Misc. Details

How will payment be distributed and handled?

- We will be asking for the requested amount as a single lump sum payment. The amount granted will then be split into two chunks, each comprising 50% of the total.
	- 50% will be DCA'd out into stables over the following 15 days. Meaning a maximum daily sell pressure of no more than ~$666 per day for chains granting the full 20k, such as the Hub, and far less for others. This will be the base contribution.
	- The other 50% will be set aside for the content incentives program outlined above, and we will be gauging community sentiment on doing one of the three following options
		- Keep in the native currency
		- DCA out to stables along with the rest. Sell pressure will be kept to the above figure or less.
		- DCA out half (of the 50%, or 25% of the total) along with the base contribution.

Will the incentives program be transparent?
	- Of course! We will keep records of payouts and the work done to receive them for the community to review. This also serves to provide a metric for results, and should help communities gauge whether a continuation of this program later down the road would be something of interest to them or not.

How long do you intend the incentive programs to last?
	- Due to the drastically different ask amounts amongst various chains, as well as the amount of content relevant to them, some chains' incentives may dry up much quicker than others. We believe that with the program we've outlined above, regardless of the duration, the general amount of work achieved per dollar spent should be similar.

What happens if a chain does not pass the proposal, are they to be treated any differently?
	- Absolutely not. All chains and projects in the Cosmos are equal in our eyes, and no community will be penalized for failing to support our effort, except by missing out on the incentives program and, of course, contributing to something crucially important for the entire Interchain.

# Community Spend Proposal for Creation of Terra Developer Fund

In the last few days, the Terra CosmWasm-based smart contract network has suffered a potentially catastrophic attack. Though the full implications are unclear, there is likely irreversible damage to Terra's user and developer base.

The Juno Network consists of a strong community of passionate users and developers, and like Terra shares the mindset that the true value of a network lies in the protocols and applications built upon it. This proposal is an endeavor to enable Terra developers to continue building and innovating. Furthermore, this aims to be a lifeline for their existing users to continue to benefit from these developers’ platforms.

Several Terra projects have reached out and expressed interest in migrating to and developing on Juno Network. It is expected that many more innovative projects and teams will follow with the passing of this proposal. 

## Background

On May 9th, 2022 the Terra chain appears to have suffered a financial attack that resulted in the insolvency of the network, and a crash in both UST and LUNA. 

The combined market cap of LUNA/UST prior to the attack was in excess of 39.1 billion dollars. There are many hugely successful CosmWasm applications on Terra. These applications and protocols will need a home going forward. 

Juno, as a firmly established CosmWasm chain, can provide a platform and considerable community support for these developers to continue building their projects - a new home. 

This will also benefit Juno by bringing in a wave of new users, developers and applications.

## Proposed Use of Funds

The Community Fund contains roughly 16,248,583 JUNO, or approximately $75,880,883 in USD equivalent / €72,845,647 in EUR equivalent at the time of writing.

This proposal would allocate a total of 1,000,000 JUNO (700,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool & 300,000 JUNO from the Juno Development Fund) to a Terra Developer Fund Multi-sig for project migration and continued development in the Juno ecosystem. It is worth approximately $4,670,000 in USD equivalent / €4,483,647 EUR equivalent at the time of writing.

Via governance, the funding could be further expanded with additional disbursements, if development accelerates, or returned back to the respective community and developer fund pools from the Multi-sig, if development wanes. A proposal will be put up 60 days from the passing of this proposal to decide.

## Proposed Management of Funds

If this proposal passes, 1 million total JUNO will be sent to the treasury of a newly-formed Terra Developer Fund Multisig on DAODAO. Multi-sig members can vote on project funding on a case-by-case basis.

The Multi-sig will be structured as a 5 of 9 Multi-sig managed by:

* Jack Zampolin (Core-1, Strangelove) juno130mdu9a0etmeuw52qfxk73pn0ga6gawk4k539x

598,"Parameter Change: Increase Deposit Amount for Cosmos Hub Governance

# Increase Deposit Amount for Cosmos Hub Governance

## Proposal Deposit Concept:

* For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be submitted with a deposit of the amount defined by the **min_deposit** param in the governance module before the deposit end time.
* A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single wallet, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.
* The proposer account is only required to deposit **~1 ATOM**.

## Proposal to Increase Deposit Amount:

By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit costs **64 ATOM** or approximately **640** in **USD** equivalent, which currently appears to be inadequate at preventing spam proposals and may not be high enough to encourage more thoughtful approaches towards proposal submissions.

With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to **250 ATOM** or approximately **2,500** in **USD** equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance. This proposal deposit price adjustment aligns more closely with recent parameter changes that other chains within the Cosmos have made.

## Important Note: 

Community Members *must not* be priced out of making proposals on chain. **250 ATOM** is likely a large enough deposit to deter spam, while still being within the reach of most community members to campaign for a deposit, or provide one themselves.

Multiple wallets may fund a proposal deposit, so this remains within the ability of most Cosmos Hub users to campaign for and crowdsource funding from other community members and validators, wherever a good proposal may exist, but funding for a deposit is lacking.

## Voting:

* By voting **YES**, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 64 ATOM to 250 ATOM.
* By voting **NO**, you disagree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 64 ATOM to 250 ATOM.
* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
* Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.

## Bio

Long-term Terra & Kujira community member. Well known for trying to break down complex DeFi ideas for the retail masses, alongside a healthy dose of memes.

## Related Experience

Formerly Operations Lead at Prism Protocol. Member of GT Captial — spent many hours during the bull market reviewing pitch decks from projects for prospective investments & having detailed discussions around tokenomics and value accrual. Regular Q&A host with projects during their launch phase. In my professional life, I regularly work with vendors on contract & commercial negotiation & managing high-value commercial tendering processes — skill sets that I think would transition well to this role.

## Personal Statement

I've been a long-term supporter of Kujira, taking part in both seed and early-bird funding rounds, as well as consistently marketing the success of their various product launches. I believe in the success of Grown Up DeFi and want to help the chain succeed. I've also lived the dream of going full-time crypto only to have that taken away from me through the Terra crash and I'm keen to be back involved with a project in some capacity.

# Increase Validator Set to 150

With the recent growth of Juno Network, we have seen a great deal of development and newcomers entering the space, with many new community members and validators wishing to participate as active validators. Currently the floor to become an active validator is quite high, at nearly 47,700 JUNO or approximately $168,000 USD.

As of right now, there is currently a number of validators sitting just outside the active set who have also been active historically, with many more waiting for a set expansion to join in consensus. A more diverse set of validators brings new ideas into the space, new viewpoints in governance and often leads to new innovation and development for the chain.

As with all set expansions, it is possible that expanding the set could have a small effect on the overall block times taking longer, as more validators will be required to achieve consensus. After reviewing analysis of previous set expansions, these effects appear negligible upon block times during that period, but it is important to communicate clearly both the pros and cons of any parameter change to the network.

## Decentralization of Stake

Set expansions are not a perfect science, and in reviewing that same analysis provided by some other talented validators, we have seen that historically these expansions don't always lead to further decentralization of stake on their own. 

We hope that delegators will take the opportunity of this set expansion to **rebalance their stake** from the top of the active set to competent validators lower on the list.

Balancing your stake **outside the top 10 to 20 validators** on the network is the best way to assist in this initiative, as we work together as a community to improve the voting power balance on Juno even further.

## Best Practices

We also strongly encourage new validators entering the set to avoid behavior such as **NFT giveaways**, **validator specific snapshots** or **commission refunds/rebates** which circumvent the 5 percent minimum commissions as established by [Juno Network Prop 3](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/3).

Equally we recommend that delegators and investors avoid participating in these activities if they see them, and instead find strong validators which respect and follow the parameters of the network as they were established through the governance, by the community. Keep your stake safe by choosing technically competent validators.

## Vote

By voting **YES** to this proposal, you agree to change the MaxValidators parameter from 135 to 150, allowing 15 new validators to enter the set.

By voting **NO** to this proposal, you disagree with increasing the validator set and prefer keeping the current MaxValidator value of 135.

By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

As users will be able to claim their ICNS names by verifying their Twitter handles in its bootstrapping phase, these contracts will be in charge of verifying Twitter OAuth, minting NFT for the given user name, and keeping the list of addresses for each bech32 prefix.\n\n**All name resolutions will take place on the Osmosis blockchain initially**, but it is expected that ICNS will switch to using an outpost model that allows each chain’s name resolution to happen locally by deploying address resolution contracts on other CosmWasm-enabled blockchains. \n\nPlease also note that there will be a multisig admin account(s) that is collectively owned by the initial committee of builders including Chainapsis, Cosmostation, Commonwealth, and Skiff, and it will be in charge of managing the three contracts of ICNS and adding/removing operators of Twitter OAuth verification. \n\n**This proposal would approve the deployment of NameNFT Contract, which is in charge of minting the NFT for the given user name and managing the ownership of the NFT**. The admin account(s) will also be managed by this contract. \n**More details can be found here:**\n1) Github: [https://github.com/interchain-name/icns](https://github.com/interchain-name/icns)\n2) Official Announcement: [https://medium.com/@icns/announcing-icns-the-interchain-name-service-e61e0c3e2abb](https://medium.com/@icns/announcing-icns-the-interchain-name-service-e61e0c3e2abb)\n3) Long Form Proposal (Commonwealth): [https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/8372-upload-interchain-nameservice-smart-contracts](https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/8372-upload-interchain-nameservice-smart-contracts)\n\n\nSha256 Checksum using cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.12.10 for the ICNS Name Nft contract is: 99098847a3403ed99f7781f45c9d2a15a4fbf77eca58a451ed76bb2961905bd2\n\nCommit hash used for compiling binary for contracts is efdae05456b3e400c97711f608ede67a9a75098c",0

**Proposal details**
Signaling proposal for BCNA incentivized pools.
By voting YES to this proposal, OSMO stakers support adding OSMO incentives to BCNA-liquidity pools on Osmosis.

**Details**
This is a signaling proposal to include BCNA pairs into the set of assets that get OSMO liquidity incentives.

BCNA/OSMO (pool #571) and ATOM/BCNA (pool 572) trading pairs are live on Osmosis since Friday 29-10-2021. From the get-go these pools are incentivized by the BitCanna team (https://medium.com/@BitCannaGlobal/bitcanna-is-now-live-on-osmosis-dex-e67c2c83abbf) to boost rewards for taking part in the liquidity pools.

After this proposal has passed governance, the BCNA pools are added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and begin the onboarding.

**About BitCanna**
BitCanna will provide a decentralized payment network for the legal cannabis industry, by means of the BitCanna Coin (BCNA).

Cosmoverse 2022 Sponsorship + Hacker's Lounge

Summary:

If this proposal passes, 15,000 JUNO will be allocated to the Cosmoverse team - giving Juno Two Keynote slots, Branding all over the conference, a 2.5m x 2.5m exhibition stand with LCD screen and branding banners, an exclusive Juno branded hacker’s lounge (that is one complete floor, 200 sq.m that can fit 150 people alone). The Juno Hacker’s lounge will be a great place for developers/talents to network and connect. In close coordination with the Core-1 team, we will make the best use of the Hacker’s lounge.

Description:

Cosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 26-28, 2022 (3 Day Event)

Our goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.
We expect around 1,000 attendees, with the majority coming from Latin American countries - a huge market in the crypto ecosystem.

Cosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

Where do the funds go?

- Conference venue
- F&B (conference + afterparty)
- Marketing and communications
- Production, audio and visuals
- Operational & logistical costs
Legal

The current cost for the 3-day event already exceeds $300k. Receiving support from the Juno community would contribute tremendously to ensuring that Cosmoverse will be a great success.

How does it benefit the Juno community?

By allocating 15,000 Juno from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, Juno will become the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum. Besides, the Juno community will have an exclusive 200sqm Hacker’s lounge for all conference days (that no other project has), and can fit 150 people.

- 2 Keynote speeches: If this proposal passes, we offer two keynote slots to the Juno core team (usually it’s only one keynote per project). We will keep you updated on this topic on the official Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website.
- Hacker’s Lounge: We will provide Juno with their own Hacker’s lounge, where developers can play around with CosmWasm tech, hack and earn bounties, learn, and build cool stuff. The Juno Hackers lounge is a great place for developers and talents to network and connect.
- Booth in networking area: We provide the Juno community with their own booth stand in the main networking area at the conference - a 2.5m x 2.5m exhibition stand with LCD screen and branding banners.
- Marketing: Marketing plans including (paid SM marketing, and on ground marketing leading up to the event) to attract local developers and crypto enthusiasts to come to the event and learn more about Cosmoverse and Juno.
- Merchandise: Exclusive Juno merchandise, made for 500+ attendees, we will be collaborating with merch venders from the Juno Community as well as others. 
- General Admission Tickets: We will give 10 general admission tickets to the Juno core team or the Juno community. Distribution TBD.
- Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

617,"Confio Public Goods Funding - Tranche One

## Summary
This is a community spend proposal. If it passes, it will transfer the ATOM equivalent of $1.25M  to support the Confio team in their stewardship of CosmWasm, CosmJS, and many other related repos. This is 95 697 ATOM at the current 30-day moving average price.

 This is based on a forum discussion about providing a total of $2.5M of support in two tranches to Confio. Confio will most likely apply for a second tranche in August, but the size requested will be adjusted by any other funding we have secured in the meantime, as we are applying for other sources.

Forum Discussion: [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-13-confio-public-goods-funding/9677/2](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-13-confio-public-goods-funding/9677/2)

## Purpose
*Strengthening the ATOM Economic Zone through support and Public Goods.*

Confio is the team responsible for the stewardship and development of a huge number of libraries fundamental to many developers in the Cosmos. The best known are the CosmJS & CosmWasm libraries, two key components of the Cosmos software stack, but you can review the [list of dozens of repositories](https://github.com/confio/funding/blob/main/Repositories.md) Confio maintains. These libraries are highly valued by developers and chains across the Cosmos ecosystem. In addition, they focus on expanding IBC protocols by developing IBC-enabled contracts and training others how to do so as well.

Confio is also prepared to offer some services and support for the success of Cosmos Hub secured consumer chains in exchange for such funding support. This will be defined more below, but it should be clear that there are also tangible benefits for the Cosmos Hub through this proposal. ## Use of Funds
Confio currently has a burn rate of circa 230k USD/month with around 90% of outgoing payments going to salaries. All funds from this proposal will go to pay salaries of employees. Principally developers, but also marketing/community building work (for the conference) and internal support (HR / accounting) needed to keep the company running.

Our headcount has been reducing and as of the end of February 2023, we will have 20 employees, including 10 developers and 1 product owner (one more if Ethan gets to code again and stop fundraising). To achieve this roadmap while performing a proper level of security and maintenance work, we will need around 25 people focused on Public Goods.

## Spend Details
Amount: 95697 ATOM

Recipient: cosmos12jnhpa3kemykq5mg8er27lmkj39yksgf3nr9tw (Confio GmbH)

Timeframe: 6 months ## Voting
* If you vote yes you signal your desire to compensate Confio via the Cosmos Hub community pool.
* If you vote no you signal your dissent against compensating Confio via the Cosmos Hub community pool
* If you veto this proposal you deem it harmful to the network and wish to burn the proposer's ATOM.

618,"Make Osmosis the Co-Lead Sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022

Summary:

If this signaling proposal passes, the funding provided by Osmosis proposal #110 will be used to make the Osmosis community the co-lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022.

Description:

Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world and raise more awareness of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. This year’s Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia - on September 27 & 28.
Just as last year, Cosmoverse will keep a strong community spirit. We aim to bring the Cosmos community together in one room with core Cosmos builders. The community will be able to ask questions, listen to keynote speeches, and talk to Cosmos core developers face to face. This also gives Cosmos projects the opportunity to strengthen their relationship with the community.

Why should the funds from prop #110 be used for sponsorship?

Prop #110 was submitted by NosNodes (https://twitter.com/NosNodes) with the purpose to incentivize more community building by the Cosmoverse team. Thank you, NosNodes! <3

After Prop #110 passed, the Cosmoverse team received 20,000 OSMO in funding. We are extremely grateful for that. 
We were able to use the funds to organize meetups (like the Denver Meetup: https://twitter.com/CosmoverseHQ/status/1495248152865042434?s=20&t=MZgUGjZuO6tkZBDB5Jmnqw), pay the initial deposit for the Medellin conference and cover travel expenses. 
Without Osmosis, Cosmoverse would never have become what it is today.

How does it benefit the Osmosis community?

The funds from Osmosis prop #110 will make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.

- Keynote speech: We offer two keynote slots to the Osmosis core team. Speakers TBA on our official Twitter account.
- Booth in networking area: We offer Osmosis a prominent booth stand in the main networking area.
- Logo placement: The Osmosis logo will be shown as “co-lead sponsor at the conference.
- General Admission Tickets: We will give 10 general admission tickets to the Osmosis core team or the Osmosis community. Distribution TBD.
- Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.
- Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

Amount to spend from the community pool: 5250 ATOMs

Timeline: Q1 2020

Deliverables:
1. A governance working group community & charter
2. A template for community spend proposals
3. A best-practices document for community spend proposals
4. An educational wiki for the Cosmos Hub parameters
5. A best-practices document for parameter changes
6. Monthly governance working group community calls (three)
7. Monthly GWG articles (three)
8. One Q2 2020 GWG recommendations article

Milestones:
By end of Month 1, the Cosmos Governance Working Group (GWG) should have been initiated and led by Gavin Birch of Figment Networks.
By end of Month 2, Gavin Birch is to have initiated and led GWG’s education, best practices, and Q2 recommendations.
By end of Month 3, Gavin Birch is to have led and published initial governance education, best practices, and Q2 recommendations.

Detailed milestones and funding:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFEvMSLbiHoVAYqBq8lo3qQw3KtPMEqDFz47ESf6HEg/edit?usp=sharing

Beyond the milestones, Gavin will lead the GWG to engage in and answer governance-related questions on the Cosmos Discourse forum, Twitter, the private Cosmos VIP Telegram channel, and the Cosmos subreddit. The GWG will engage with stake-holders to lower the barriers to governance participation with the aim of empowering the Cosmos Hub’s stakeholders. The GWG will use this engagement to guide recommendations for future GWG planning.

Read more about the our efforts to launch the Cosmos GWG here: https://figment.network/resources/introducing-the-cosmos-governance-working-group/

-=-=-

_Problem_
Perhaps the most difficult barrier to effective governance is that it demands one of our most valuable and scarce resources: our attention. Stakeholders may be disadvantaged by informational or resource-based asymmetries, while other entities may exploit these same asymmetries to capture value controlled by the Cosmos Hub’s governance mechanisms.

We’re concerned that without establishing community standards, processes, and driving decentralized delegator-based participation, the Cosmos Hub governance mechanism could be co-opted by a centralized power. As governance functionality develops, potential participants will need to understand how to assess proposals by knowing what to pay attention to.

_Solution_
We’re forming a focused, diverse group that’s capable of assessing and synthesizing the key parts of a proposal so that the voting community can get a fair summary of what they need to know before voting.

Our solution is to initiate a Cosmos governance working group that develops decentralized community governance efforts alongside the Hub’s development. We will develop and document governance features and practices, and then communicate these to the broader Cosmos community.

_Future_
At the end of Q1, we’ll publish recommendations for the future of the Cosmos GWG, and ideally we’ll be prepared to submit a proposal based upon those recommendations for Q2 2020. We plan to continue our work in blockchain governance, regardless of whether the Hub passes our proposals.

This is a heavily truncated version of the Komple Framework, KompleJS & Marketplace Builder Proposal. 

Please read the full length IPFS proposal [here](https://bafybeiftfnekil5tcru5zohydiwfoz3yzzgqtvhj3id6tbj6b3jch3ri7i.ipfs.nftstorage.link). 

# Introduction 

We at Komple have experience working with wasm smart contracts and are committed to pushing the technology to its limits. 

With Komple, we aim to utilize the potential of Juno Network and CosmWasm by developing new open-source tools for NFT based applications, making them more accessible to the community. 

# Komple Framework & KompleJS 

View documentation [here](https://docs.komple.io). 
Make sure to check out our documentation website for more in-depth information. 

Komple Framework is a smart contract framework developed with CosmWasm to build out NFT based applications. 

Containing different modules such as merge module, dynamic metadata module, p2p swap module and even accommodating custom modules developed by the community, Komple Framework gives developers the tools they need to bring their projects to life. 

With KompleJS, developing Javascript applications is easier than ever. It is tightly integrated with Komple Framework releases. 

# Community-Centric Marketplace Builder 

Our community-centric marketplace builder allows for projects to build and configure their own marketplaces without needing to touch a single line of code. 

We call this tool Marbu. 

Marbu allows DAOs, projects and individuals to shape their projects based on their custom needs. 

With the use of modularity and contract interactions made possible by the Komple Framework, all projects within Marbu will have the ability to collaborate, scale up and put creativity first. 

While having the tools for such things, projects and Juno community will also benefit from the secondary sale fees - extracting the value they are bringing. 

Simply, Marbu aims to be the home of NFT based applications on Juno Network. 

# Project Timeline 

Komple is asking for a total of 320K USD from Juno community. This is to be released gradually, based on projects development and milestone progress. 

The milestone system enables a social contract between us and the Juno community. We need to prove ourselves at each milestone. 

At the time of this proposal going live, 320K USD is equal to 65440 JUNO. 

We've split this process into 4 milestones. 

## Milestone 1: 
**Time: 2 months - 80K USD** 

Initial 40K USD released immediately for kickstarting operations. 

Remaining 40K USD will be taken after completing these points: 

* Having v1.0.0 of Komple Framework. Hub, Mint, Token, Metadata, Marketplace, Whitelist, Merge, and Permission modules. 
* Having Marbu initial website designs ready to build. 
* Having Komple Framework testing website designs. 

## Milestone 2: 
**Time: 2 months - 80K USD** 

*Having v1.0.0 of KompleJS based on v1.0.0 of Komple Framework. 
Having a live Komple Framework testing website for developers, ready to test out applications built with Komple Framework. 
Starting the Marbu website development. 

## Milestone 3: 
**Time: 1 month - 80K USD** 

* Having the beta version for Marbu website deployed on testnet. 
* Having the incentivized bug bounties on Marbu website. 

## Milestone 4: 
**Time 1 month - 80K USD** 

* Finishing the Marbu website and successfully deploying on mainnet.

623,"Lowering Liquidity Pool Creation Fee

Although the Gravity DEX launch on Cosmos Hub is technically successful, there exists several necessary ingredient to achieve significant user-base growth.

It includes of course, “farming incentives” for liquidity providers, but also the high pool creation fee disturbs quick adoption of pools with new tokens. The pool creation fee was introduced to prevent possible spamming attack to create tons of meaningless pools which will cause performance burden on Cosmos Hub.

Currently the fee(`PoolCreationFee`) is 40 Atoms, which is almost $1,600 as now. It was suggested when the Atom price is under $10, but now we have more reasons to make it significantly lower so that we can promote quicker new token introduction to the Gravity DEX.

Therefore we suggest 5 Atoms for pool creation fee, which is equivalent to about $200. We think that it is still very conservative amount for spamming prevention. Also we can suggest to adjust the fee amount again when it is necessary.",0
624,"Distribute LP rewards for epoch that ended at 2021-06-23 (Revised)

TL;DR:
We propose to distribute LP rewards for the epoch that ended at 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC to those that were bonded just before 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC.

Proposal:
This proposal seeks to equitably reward early liquidity providers (""ELPs"") who failed to receive the liquidity mining rewards that were communicated by the Osmosis Team. Proposal #2 for initiation of liquidity mining incentives for bonded liquidity providers passed on 2021-06-23 16:52 UTC. Prior to Proposal #2 passing, the Osmosis Team issued the following message: ""Note that users can begin bonding their LP tokens even though liquidity incentives haven’t been enabled yet, and their first LP reward will be distributed at 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC.""
Discord link: https://discord.com/channels/798583171548840026/842477665860583434/856777198442774569
Skylink: https://skygallery.hns.skyportal.xyz/#/a/AABDv3g-2RYw1FbuF8BDn2yKyjS_5jMOrSVkS-KdWTQfoQ

Based upon that and other messages, the community (including the Osmosis Team) believed that ELPs would receive their portion of the newly initiated liquidity mining rewards at the close of that epoch. ELPs assumed significant risk by providing liquidity and bonding their tokens at a time when overall liquidity on Osmosis was a small fraction of what it is today. Unfortunately, ELPs received no rewards for their service. The Osmosis Team acknowledges this miscommunication and recommended that the community submit a governance proposal to distribute the rewards from the community pool to ELPs. ELPs experienced substantial impermanent loss, price slippage, and lost opportunity cost of capital. ELPs rightfully expected liquidity rewards for these risks by providing the earliest and most important liquidity on the platform, especially considering the miscommunication from the Osmosis Team. Instead, ELPs performed worse than those who retained liquid capital and bonded later when there was less risk, less slippage and more volume (at the expense of ELPs). This result is inequitable and contrary to the ethos of Osmosis.

Should this proposal pass, the liquidity rewards will be distributed to applicable recipients from the community pool after a future software upgrade performed by the Osmosis Team. We thank you for your consideration.

Note:
This proposal is a revision of proposal #11, which proposed to distribute 20% of the rewards to current LPs. Following discussions with community members (particularly on Discord), a strong opinion was that a 20% concession would set a bad precedent. The issue is that, regardless of what the intention is, rewarding other LPs in this context is essentially vote buying. We strongly believe that proposals for community spending should be free of bribes.",0
625,"Cosmos Ecosystem News Videos

## **Cosmos Ecosystem News Videos**

## **Summary**

- Cosmic Validator is a long-term Cosmos ecosystem focused validator that started validating the Cosmos Hub in 2019 itself, during the first year of mainnet launch
- We seek 300 ATOM in a monthly funding, for a period of 6 months to continue producing high quality Cosmos Hub & ecosystem news videos

## **Cosmic Validator**

We have been really involved within the Cosmos ecosystem and its community for several years already before the Cosmos Hub launch or the Game of Stakes. We were amongst the first validators in the Cosmos Hub since 2019 and we have been actively participating in governance since then, currently being one of the validators with the highest governance participation in the Cosmos Hub. We are also participating in the Game of Chains to help testing the upcoming Interchain Security. We are fully committed and focused on the Cosmos ecosystem, we are validating only networks within the Cosmos ecosystem.

## **Funding**

The Cosmos ecosystem news videos project, at the time of writing this proposal, has no funding such as grants or sponsors. If the ICF grants program would reopen in 2023 then we would apply for a grant and if successful then the Community pool funding would be stopped and replaced with the ICF grant.

## **Proposal details**

The Cosmos ecosystem, with the launch of IBC, has grown significantly and it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of all the important developments and updates. While news is shared on several platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Telegram, Blogs and others, the information is very spread and usually challenging for stakeholders to find it and avoid missing some important updates. Some projects exist trying to gather and put together the main news, however these are mostly news headlines without in-depth assessments or educational content.

Keeping Cosmos stakeholders aligned and informed about important developments in areas such as governance, new technical features, project launches and upgrades or conferences is important and helps to have more constructive discussions.

Our goal with the Cosmos ecosystem news videos is to both educate and keep the broad Cosmos ecosystem community and stakeholders well informed, as well as helping to onboard new users to the ecosystem and increase the awareness about the advantages of building with Cosmos tech.

## **Deliverables**

There will be two monthly Cosmos ecosystem news videos produced, so for the initial 6 months period a total of 12 videos will be delivered.

## **Funding amount**

Total amount requested: 300 ATOM monthly for an initial period of 6 months, with a renewal if all deliverables are completed.

This corresponds to roughly 3,000 USD monthly and covers the production costs for two monthly Cosmos ecosystem news videos, including research and content preparation, filming and the required equipment, video design and additional operational costs.

Proposal details

- By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to HOPE-OSMO liquidity pool 653 on Osmosis.

- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to HOPE-OSMO liquidity pool 653 on Osmosis.

Details
After this proposal has passed governance, the HOPE/OSMO pool #653 will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO, begin the onboarding process, and bring HOPE back to the main app.

In the meantime,
The Hope community Dao has approved a governance proposal on DaoDao to allocate 1000 HOPE (6,18% of the total supply) to be used as external liquidity rewards on the HOPE/OSMO pool #653. 

These are the characteristics of the gauge we will create:
-pool #653 HOPE/OSMO
-1 external incentive
-1000 HOPE 
-14 days bonding
-duration 180 epochs

Reasoning as to why it's just a 1 gauge: HOPE is a long-term project, and is really only interested in attracting long-term liquidity providers.


About Hope Galaxy project:

candidates as you'd like to see represent the comminity. The top 9 by total yes votes will instantiate the first version of The Senate.

## Bio

Researcher @ Kujira / member of KujiDAO

## Related Experience

I am a Stanford graduate with a rigorous background in theoretical mathematics and a master's degree + a few years of experience in actuarial science (risk & insurance). I am part of Team Kujira, and among other responsibilities, I help research the community and ecosystem as part of my role. I helped create KuijDAO along with some friends to provide value to the Kujira community. I have been part of the Kujira community since January 2022. I helped write up the new Kujira internal documents at docs.kujira.app — I understand our community values and take them very seriously.

## Personal Statement

This position synergizes well with my responsibilities in researching the community and ecosystem as part of general product and user research. I enjoy general innovation and strategy — and being on the Senate allows me to stay involved with the community while leveraging my knowledge to best serve their interests. If I don't get the position, I'll continue doing my best creating value elsewhere in whatever way I can regardless, but the senate position would definitely be convenient.

## Bio

Crypto Degen, I try to educate the community and help projects grow. I've been working full-time in crypto since early 2021. I believe that crypto can change the world for the better and aim to help in that vision. Member of Kuji DAO.

## Related Experience

I've been in crypto since 2017, since then I've done everything from trading to NFTs, DeFi designing, and getting rugged. Currently I work as an analyst, most publicly with The Birb Nest as their Lead Fundamental Analyst. Also do research work with Apex Digital and other private advising for protocols and projects. I am the Treasury lead for Pozzle Planet, a protocol on Polygon, where we have not only applied for funding across different funds and VCs but also designed tokenomics and how the protocol captures revenue. Also am a DeFi Clan lead with Rekt Gang (NFT). I am also a Co-founder of Kuji DAO, however, I would not let this influence any of my decisions. Also, the DAO has 9 other members so I am only 1 vote there. In the past I've worked with startups, and also largely been an athlete so a bit of a diverse background.

## Personal Statement

I wish to push the growth and improvement of Kujira, this position is a way that I can contribute to the positive growth of the Kujira ecosystem. I believe many projects and protocols have struggled with their use of funds and often this comes back to bite them. I want to improve on the mistakes of the past and build something better for the future. This position means that I can look out for the ever-growing positive future of Kujira

631,"Remove the proposer bonus lottery

Parameter change proposal to set baseproposerreward & bonusproposerreward params to ZERO to remove the undesireable centralization incentive it creates.\n\nThere is a detailed writeup on the  Osmosis Commonwealth why we should pass this proposal : https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/1688-remove-the-proposer-bonus-lottery\n\n****REPRINTED BELOW****\nCurrently 1-5% of epoch rewards go to the validator (and their delegators) who proposed the epoch block. The exact percentage depends on details of how many validators were counted as online at the epoch block. This is an unfair system for a number of reasons, and introduces a force to centralize stake amongst the validators who already have the most stake. This is because:\n\n1. (In theory) The chance of a validator being the proposer is proportional to their stake, which means you have the same expected return, but lower variance with larger validators. This gives an incentive to delegate to the largest validators. (There is a similar effect in POW mining systems like Bitcoin, which leads to pools)\n2. In practice, the chance of a validator being the epoch proposer is 0 if they are not in the top 66% (by stake) of fastest validators. Only the validators who finish computing the block first will be potential proposers for it. This also contributes to centralization, as the largest validators can most afford to maximize their speed.\n3. The proposer selection algorithm is not based on secure randomness, it isn’t even random at all. It is in fact highly manipulable. There are known strategies validator operators could use to attempt to propose a specific block. Actual usage of these strategies could be considered byzantine behavior, and could lead to further network instability around the epoch time.\n\nThis centralization effect is harmful to the long term success of the network – we want the stake distribution to become much less top heavy. Stake distribution has been decentralizing nicely as time has gone in the network, but it would be ideal to further accelerate this decentralization. And whats critical to that, is at minimum, lowering the incentive for the stake to centralize at the top. We are nowhere near the end state yet for stake distribution!\n\n--Short Term Suggestion--\n\nCreate a parameter change proposal to set the proposer bonus to 0%. This would then go into affect immediately after the proposal passes.\n\n--Long Term Suggestion--\n\nThis is definitely a conversation that needs to be designed together over time!\nTalking with @UnityChaos & @dogemos, we thought it’d be cool to re-introduce this proposer bonus lottery, but have it only be applicable to the bottom {say} 50 validators. Also have the total pot of the reward not be 5%, but instead be around {say} 1% of the reward. This would help incentivize decentralization of the network, and also retain the (accidentally introduced) lottery effect that so many folks like! (Since delegating to smaller validators would be higher EV!)\n\nIt is possible that higher stake validators sybil themselves into multiple lower stake validators. The hope is that the pot here is sufficiently low, that this won’t be worth the reputational hit that the sybilling validator would take. (And would also cause community uproar, justifying a governance proposal to slash them) There is still a fear that the big validator makes multiple sybils anonymously, this is quite plausible if its all their own funds. Noticeability only really comes in when its from validators gathering delegations from users, or are trying to build a common brand.\n\nThe blocker for re-introducing this epoch reward lottery this is we need a secure on-chain randomness source. (In addition to design work to ensure sybilling incentivizes are sufficiently low) This can be added as a follow-on to the threshold decryption work that is being worked on. The threshold decryption work eliminates most of the known forms of MEV learned about from Ethereum, such as front-running, sandwitching, stealing arbs, etc. – making them unable to applied on Osmosis once its done. It turns out that the technical primitive underlying this is very well suited for making a secure on-chain randomness source.",0

** About Panacea & MediBloc **

Panacea is a Cosmos-based blockchain that has been launched in 2019 by MediBloc.
On top of Panacea, MediBloc is designing the generic data sharing/verification protocol, so that anyone can:
- issue various data in verifiable manners
- own their data securely
- present their data to someone to get benefits

Also, MediBloc is planning to extend that data protocol to the data market protocol, so that data owners can get incentivized transparently by providing their data securely to various data consumers.

For that vision, MediBloc has implemented core building blocks on Panacea, such as DID / VerifiableCredentials / SelectiveDisclosure using ZKP.
In near future, MediBloc is going to present the first version of the data sharing protocol publicly, so that it can be improved by various community members.

Furthermore, MediBloc has released Dr.palette EHR (Electronic Health Record) for hospitals and Medipass PHR (Electronic Health Record) for patients. Those applications would be the first players who boost the verifiable data sharing protocol. It means that MediBloc will show the first example that the protocol can be very useful in the healthcare field. It would be a great impact because healthcare data is not only one of the most inaccessible data types, but also requires many privacy concerns.

While MediBloc is developing those use-cases, we would like to maximize the liquidity of MED which will be used for the verifiable data protocol in near future.

636,"Clawback ALL unclaimed ION & OSMO to Community Pool after airdrop decay period?

The passing of Prop #29 generated plenty of further community discussion on how to go about enacting a clawback and how to utilize it. This proposal seeks to build upon the initial consensus achieved and separate the vote on an execution framework for a clawback from any specific uses for clawedback tokens.\n\n***Reminder***\n'Unclaimed' tokens are defined as being in wallets which have a Sequence Number = 0, which means the address has NOT performed a single action during the 6 month airdrop claim window.\n\n******CLAWBACK PROPOSED FRAMEWORK******\nTLDR -- Send ALL unclaimed ION & OSMO back to the community pool and prune those inactive wallets from current state.\n\nThis proposal has three key updates to highlight from the prior proposal:

1)  This is to vote for ALL unclaimed Ion be clawedback, not just 80% as was suggested in Prop #29 as an approach to synchronize Ion/Osmo airdrops.\n2)  Clawing back the 20% of OSMO which sit in inactive wallets has been included.  Reclaiming the idle stagnating OSMO's to support the future betterment of the Osmosis Zone seems a logical extension of the consensus to clawback unclaimed Ions.  This also will keep the airdrops in alignment where both are reclaimed entirely at the end of the decay window.\n3)  Pruning of the addresses from state makes complete sense because they will be totally empty and would otherwise just be unnecessarily requiring storage space.",0

641,"Fund notional to work on the Cosmos Hub

This is funding for maintenance of the variety described here for 3 years from the date of passage.


Summary

Notional is requesting funding of 40,000 Atoms per year, for 3 years, for Hub maintenance and incident response. In return for this payment, Notional will monitor the Cosmos Hub for potential vulnerabilities on a 365/24/7 basis. When we become aware of an ongoing vulnerability, we will coordinate with relevant teams (SDK, IBC, Comet/Tendermint, Cosmos Hub), and work to produce a patch. We will then assist in rolling these patches out to validators to resolve the incident as soon as possible.

We will also advise core teams if we notice issues in upcoming releases which could cause safety or liveness problems, and assist them to resolve the issues.

We will write a monthly report on our activities so that the community has insight into them and can keep us accountable. Since the funding will be disbursed on a vesting basis, the amount can always be adjusted by governance, adding even more accountability to the arrangement.

Here are some incidents and potential incidents we helped resolve or prevent in the past:

We reported and helped fix an ICA issue affecting Quicksilver on the hub in the fall of 2022.
We reported Golang version mismatches that can cause apphash errors
We’ve worked on improving archive node sync speed and proper upgrade procedure
We reported and fixed Cosmos Hub and Cosmos-SDK CI Systems that reported as passed no matter what
We report, helped fix, and helped distribute fixes for CPU usage spikes that resulted in the discovery of a potential exploit in Comet / Tendermint P2P
https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.25

We cannot and will not disclose security items until they are fixed, so we will rely on teams like ICF, Informal, IG, Iqlusion, Strangelove and Binary Holdings to confirm for the community that we are actively working in that space.

We also continuously work to improve and develop the systems we work with, including Tendermint/Comet, Cosmos-SDK, IBC, and the Cosmos Hub. Members of the ICF and its TAB have recognized that our contributions to the stack from a technical perspective are substantial. Here are some examples of the development work we have been doing. We’ll keep making improvements like these as we find things to improve and as time allows:

https://nvlabs.notion.site/Interchain-Foundation-81c2e013f10a44e8a94701f5f97e9c7d



What we aren’t doing
We are not asking for product ownership of any of the above named repositories, the current product owners are excellent.
We are not implying that we will not seek funding for specific initiatives that go beyond the scope of maintenance.
We are not expressing to the community that we can find or solve every possible issue in security.

Recipient

We think it is essential for accountability and good governance that community pool funding recipients such as ourselves are given their funding in a vesting form for ongoing services. However, due to some technical limitations it is not possible to send funds directly from the community pool to a vesting account. For this reason, the funding will first go to prominent community members on a multisig who will then transfer it directly to a vesting account controlled by Notional.

Community members will create a 2/3 single use multisignature wallet to receive funding and share the address with the community. The funds will only be in this multisig for a few hours until the signers transfer them to our vesting account where they will be released over the term of our work.

The signers will be community members with the needed experience.  This is a single-use multisig account composed of community members.

If the community feels displeased with Notional's work, they should create a governance proposal to claw back the unvested portion.


Oversight and reporting
We will regularly update work status on our notion page continuously and do monthly and quarterly reporting. In the case of material events in the Cosmos that require urgent tactical response, Notional will endeavor on a best effort basis to provide updates within 24/48 hours of work being completed or as soon as practical or feasible once the bugs are patched here:


https://nvlabs.notion.site/Interchain-Foundation-81c2e013f10a44e8a94701f5f97e9c7d


For work that affects security, we will report privately in the channels that we have established to the product owners of the repositories mentioned, we feel communication is key for an efficient process.
We invite any technical organization with sufficient technical capabilities to contact us during the course of this proposal to be formally listed as participating in oversight.

These organizations include but are not limited to:

Founding Orgs:
Interchain Foundation
Allinbits, inc
Prominent technical orgs:

643,"Match External Incentives for CMDX/OSMO and CMDX/ATOM pairs

As established in Osmosis proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

* Proposal Details*

Match external incentives provided by the Comdex team for CMDX/ATOM (pool 600) and CMDX/OSMO (pool 601) the external incentives will continue for 180 epochs ONLY for the 7-day and 14-day unbonding period gauges.

- By voting YES on this proposal, external CMDX incentives will be matched by corresponding OSMO rewards.
- By voting NO on this proposal, external CMDX incentives will NOT be matched by corresponding OSMO rewards.

 Context 
The Comdex team will be  providing 2,000,000 CMDX across CMDX/ATOM pool 600 and CMDX/OSMO pool 601 amounting to ~3,600,000 USD (calculated at 1.80 USD per CMDX) over the course of 180 epochs beginning Monday, March 14th 2022

The CMDX incentives are as follows:
- CMDX/ATOM (Pool #600): ~5,555 CMDX per day amounting to ~10,000 USD
- CMDX/OSMO (Pool #601): ~5,555 CMDX per day amounting to ~10,000 USD",0
644,"Increase Max Validator Set Size to 125

Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRhQycV19QiTQGLuPzPHfJwCioj1wDeHHtZvxiHegTFDd 

This proposal supercedes proposal number 9, which contains conflicting numbers in the title and body. 

In the Cosmos Hub, the total number of active validators is currently capped at 100, ordered by total delegated Atoms. This number was originally proposed in the Cosmos whitepaper section titled [Limitations on the Number of Validators](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#limitations-on-the-number-of-validators 4). This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet.  

However, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of <7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set.  

In the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases. Future increases to the validator set size will be originated through governance.",0
645,"Governance Parameter Changes

This proposal seeks to make two gov parameter changes; 1. To increase the voting period of a proposal to 48h, and 2. To increase the deposit requirement to 10,000 KUJI per proposal.

The voting period change is designed to give stakers and validators more time to consider new proposals after submission, as the current 24h window is too short.

The deposit change is designed to protect against spam proposals, and will allow the Kujira community to use the proposal deposit interface at https://blue.kujira.app, where multiple wallets can contribute to the deposit for a single proposal.",0

648,"Juno - Keplr Wallet Native Integration

After the successful mainnet launch and Moneta upgrade, Juno has become a critical part of the Cosmos ecosystem. In order to double down on Juno's presence in the ecosystem, being a natively integrated chain on Keplr Wallet is one of the best ways to increase the reach of Juno protocol to hundreds of thousands of interchain-native users.

Therefore, the Keplr development team requests an allocation of $360K (based on JUNO priced as $10.37 30d historical average daily close price according to Coingecko) from the Juno community pool for development, operations, and infrastructure for Keplr Wallet native integration.

The specific details are the following:

- Deliverable #1: Keplr extension native integration
- Juno listed as a native chain on Keplr extension
- Node operation support
- Provide Staking & Governance interface, infrastructure operations

- Deliverable #2: Keplr mobile support
- Juno listed as a native chain on Keplr mobile
- Node operation support
- Provide Staking & Governance interface

Details:

Keplr will guarantee a minimum of 12 months of native integration support for Juno on Keplr Extension and Mobile. Payment will be under 1-year linear vesting.

By listing Juno on Keplr wallet, the team expects the enriching impact of Juno on the Cosmos ecosystem and helping users to easily use JUNO for staking and governance.

651,"Fix IBC transfers between Lum Network and Osmosis

This proposal replaces proposal #256. We kindly ask OSMO stakers to consider proposal #256 voided and to reject it in favour of this current proposal.

== Proposal replacement details ==

This new proposal introduces a new IBC client 07-tendermint-1991 to replace legacy client 07-tendermint-1987 on channel Osmosis(115) and LumNetwork(3).
The previous proposal used the legacy client 07-tendermint-1987 which ran into a trusting out-of-period, and thus got voided by protocol.
The Lum team alongside some of the Lum Network validators have now upgraded their tools to frequently update the new client 07-tendermint-1991 and deprecated the periodic updates of legacy one.

== Description ==

Lum Network IBC channel is currently in a frozen state following the Osmosis chain halt of the past few days.
This issue is known and has already been dealt with successfully in January 2022 where it was heavily tested prior to making a governance proposal.
The detail of the previous unfreeze operation is available here: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/115

Lum Team is now ready to proceed with a new channel unfreeze to restore connection between Lum & Osmosis.

Proposal goal:

This proposal will enable the unfreezing process of the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network, thus allowing deposits and withdrawals of $LUM on the Osmosis platform:

- By voting YES, OSMO stakers voice their support in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network
- By voting NO, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network

This proposal has no effect beside enabling back the IBC connection between the two chains.

Details:

The IBC client refresh between Osmosis and the Lum Network was not possible during the Osmosis shutdown.
Shutting down the IBC connection froze the currently use channel (3-115). Meaning that no IBC transfer can be made using this channel unless this governance proposal is voted YES by OSMO stakers.
The process to enable IBC transfers back require to substitute the current IBC client by a new one that is not in an expired.",0
652,"Governance Proposal for Gravity DEX Adoption to the Cosmos Hub

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt the Gravity DEX protocol on the Cosmos Hub. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding the Gravity DEX protocol on the Cosmos Hub.\n\n### Background\n\nIn July 2020, the Iqlusion team developed ATOM 2021 to drive the direction of the Cosmos Hub after the completion of the Cosmos whitepaper and IBC. It became clear that providing liquidity to new IBC connected zones was core the Hub's mission. \n\nTendermint ([https://tendermint.com](https://tendermint.com/)) and B-Harvest ([https://bharvest.io](https://bharvest.io/))  joined forces to produce and develop a Liquidity Module ([https://github.com/tendermint/liquidity](https://github.com/tendermint/liquidity)). In 2021 March, they submitted a signal governance proposal to ask the Atom delegator community about Gravity DEX (Liquidity Module) adoption on the Cosmos Hub. Prop38 was very well approved by the community ([https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/38](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/38)).\n\nThis proposal completes the first leg of ATOM 2021 and achieves the goals of the signaling proposal by bringing an IBC compatible DEX to the Hub.\n\n### Ready for Production\n\nWith continuous quality improvement of the codebase, very wide test coverage, a codebase audit from Least Authority and Simply VC, and subsequent follow-up codebase strengthening, along with extensive simulation processes, we are now very confident to be ready for production utilization of the Gravity DEX (Liquidity Module) on the Cosmos Hub. The Gaia branch for the new release with Gravity DEX feature can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v5.0.0)). Please also check out the [github repository](https://github.com/b-harvest/gravity-dex-upgrade-test) for the launch testing of Gaia with Gravity DEX.\n\n### On-Chain Upgrade Process\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. And then, all validators and node operators have to substitute the existing state machine binary to the new binary with the Gravity DEX feature. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\n\n### Potential Risk Factors\n\nAlthough Tendermint executed very extensive testing and simulation, and conducted in-depth audits, and followed up with the corresponding codebase improvement, there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new Gravity DEX feature. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately, and use the fixed state machine program provided by Tendermint.",0

All in Bits Inc (DBA Tendermint Inc), as the organizer of the HackAtom VI event, is responsible for the distribution of the prizes to the aforementioned winners.
According to HackAtom Rules, All in Bits Inc (DBA Tendermint Inc) will be using the Close Rate of Dec 16th, 2021 (the spot rate as of Dec 16, 2021 at 23:59:59pm) on CoinMarketCap to determine the equivalent number of Atoms representing the value of the prize in US Dollars (“ATOM Equivalent”) that needs to be paid to each winners. The closing price at Dec 16, 2021, 23:59:59pm was of $21.75 = 1 Atom.
As the funds for paying the Osmosis HackAtom winners are coming from the Osmosis community pool, the equivalent of $OSMO tokens on the Date of Dec 16th, needs to be calculated and paid to the winners.
On Dec 16th, the closing price of the $OSMO token as per Coinmarketcap historical data was of $4.18, which accounts for the payment of equivalent 11,962 $OSMO tokens.

All in Bits Inc (DBA Tendermint Inc), as the organizer responsible for distributing and paying the prizes amongst the HackAtom VI - Osmosis Challenge winners, shall receive transfer of the funds for payment in $OSMO tokens at the following wallet address:
 osmo18ae7p2q7e79cdgv7y2zvq5txlnnwscjls6axyc

663,"Signaling Proposal for XKI/JUNO incentivized pool

By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:
Adding OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:
Adding OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

The following proposal is a basic signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to include XKI/JUNO pair into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.

Regular XKI/JUNO pool have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.

** Expected benefits **

Should this proposal pass, the Liquidity Providers will then benefit from following incentives on JUNO/XKI pool:

1. OSMO incentives for LP
2. SWAP Fees

In order to incentivize more liquidity to be provided, the Ki Foundation will fund an additional incentive in XKI on the related pools. An additional incentive is considered in JUNO through onchain governance.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s )

** About Ki & Klub **

Ki is offering the compliant gateway from the Fiat world to DeFi, through Klub Ki is building DeFi protocols that will live on top of Juno while being operated through interchain accounts of multiple chains.

### Introduction - Cosmos Option Vaults Proposal

The full PDF of this proposal (complete with helpful graphics) is available [on IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeic3iflxv2ul4xm5gblu6upoxt3kwytpcm7aypgx5iocshim7etlui)

[Commonwealth Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/8839-option-vaults-by-czardao-draft-proposal)

CzarDAO is building a suite of DeFi dApps on the Juno blockchain. The DAO’s first product, [Førecast](https://forecast.deliverdao.org), launched successfully in November 2022 and has facilitated over 40k JUNO in volume in over 4,500 rounds on the platform. Førecast is a predictions market which sells binary options (“up” or “down” bets) on the underlying asset.

Now CzarDAO seeks to expand its options offerings by building an options vault on Cosmos based on [Ribbon finance’s](https://docs.ribbon.finance/) option vaults. Ribbon finance has long dominated the DeFi option space since its launch, in large part because it operates in a ‘set it and forget it’ fashion where users can earn real yield on their assets without having to constantly monitor their positions. With a quickly growing and vibrant set of assets native to Cosmos via IBC, there is a real need for this type of DeFi primitive.

With our experience, we are excited to propose, build, ship and open source a DeFi Option Vaults dApp to the Juno Network!

### Product Details

This proposal contains 6 milestones, beginning with the submission and acceptance of this proposal. Upon completion of the 6 milestones contained in this proposal CzarDAO will furnish a complete product offering access to yield-bearing vaults that sell covered calls with weekly expiries on the vault’s assets. CzarDAO will provide and maintain the UI, infrastructure and indexers to power a simple and wonderful user experience for this project.

In accordance with [Prop 64](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/64) all smart-contracts will released as open-source and furnished to the Juno community through the [CzarDAO GitHub](https://github.com/czar-dao).

### Grant Details and Timeline

Funds will be distributed after completion of each milestone via Juno Growth Fund.

We expect that this project will take us 4~5 months from the passage of this proposal to mainnet with a request of 75k USD equivalent in JUNO. Additionally, we will give the Juno Growth Fund wallet 20,000 CZAR to be staked (10% of current staked, so the SubDAO wallet will get 10% of all CzarDAO-wide revenue). That way as the wallet receives real yield, we can contribute to funding future development on Juno.

# Unity Proposal\n\nThis proposal follows the Commonwealth discussion [here](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/4102-prop-17-unity-win-win-win).\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n- CCN was ineligible for the Juno stakedrop\n- Prop 16 signalled the community wished to act and remove:\n    - CCN's concentrated voting power\n    - CCN's disproportionate token ownership\n\n## Stakedrop Remediation Implementation\n\nThe  stakedrop goal was to create a community-led smart contract platform free from centralization of power. Specifically with the essence of preventing top heavy on-chain governance control.Therefore, the  stakedrop targeted non custodial wallets only with the exclusion of centralized custodians ie. Exchange validators and their delegators.\n\n Shortly after genesis, the contents of multiple wallets were drained into a single wallet.\n\nProposal 16 was submitted and suggested to reclaim all but 50K . The community broadly supported the proposal, and so the owner of the address added a link to an article in the memo of theirAbstain vote.\n\nAfter this first statement, a second statement revealed the identity of the whale, and the nature of the business, as crypto asset exchange service.\n\nHence, CCN was ineligible for the stakedrop.\n\nBy voting yes on this proposal you agree CCN should not have received the genesis stakedrop.\n\nBy voting yes on this proposal you agree that a software upgrade should be made which adjusts CCN's balance held at juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8:\n\n- By undelegating all of CCN's current delegations\n- By instantly unbonding all of CCN's recovered delegations (bypassing the normal 28-day unbonding period)\n- By sending all of CCN's recovered and available balance to a [smart contract](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/cw-unity-prop/tree/v0.3.0) controlled by the community\n\nBy voting yes on this proposal you agree that the final decision of action to be taken should be made by the community once the funds are in a community controlled smart contract.\n\nBy voting no you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements.\n\n## Upgrade\n\nThis upgrade to Juno v4.0.0 will take place at block **2951100**, which should arrive around **1600UTC on May the 4th**, but be aware that this block could arrive +/- 2 hours or more.\n\nYou can check the ETA of block 2951100 [here](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/blocks/2951100).\n\nValidators should check in on the [Juno Discord](https://discord.gg/Juno) with any questions.\n\n",0

## Bio

Being in Crypto since 2017. Rekt Lunatic, started vigorously supporting Kujira since May 2022 just because I once again found confirmation of my experience of what distinguishes bad projects and teams from good ones. Representative from the Russian-speaking community (https://t.me/kujira_ru). I act as a channel admin and a consultant for the community members. Also, whenever possible, I voluntarily help the Kujira team in finding bugs in the products. As a private investor, I am in the list of the top 100 KUJI stakers, invested most of my capital in KUJI. Project success == my success. My life principle is that if you take on something, do it well or don't take it at all.

## Related Experience

I had been working in IT for over 15 years. A computer science engineer by education, had the opportunity to try himself in different professions: Dev (C++), SRE (including as a team leader), DBA (including as a team leader), IT Infrastructure (middle manager), project manager. All this is in the different areas: healthcare, sports facilities, banking (the longest in time), and raw materials mining. In the distant past, I even tried to live off the income from trading (of course, it didn't work out). I really hope to apply my experience for the common good. Eventually, I fulfilled the dream of many spending nearly 80% of my time in Crypto right now.

## Personal Statement

Most of my time I am doing Kujira as an independent columnist, assistant, and consultant for the community, a modest generator of ideas and meanings. I am incredibly proud to be a part of the Kujira community because it has no equal anywhere in the Crypto world. I've seen a lot of teams around outside of Cosmos and there's not one even standing close to Kujira. I will continue to do what I am doing regardless of whether I am elected or not. The main value for me is the trust of the community, and I really hope to justify it.

Creator. Visionary. Dreamweaver… Kuji Kast.

## Related Experience

Before my Web3 journey, I graduated from UCL with a degree in Ancient History. They had a Senate back then. The first one ever. Which I studied. So in a way, my experience goes back as far as possible… Pre-crypto I worked as an actor, comedian, and filmmaker, and during this time I was involved in securing finance for a television pilot. I also worked for a conference company for 5+ years and would converse with companies to bring them to events at varying rates on various packages depending on their needs (group attendance, sponsorship etc). I would also assist startups in arranging meetings with Private Investors and Family Offices. I have also been a part of Kujira since pre-IDO. I have consistently been a believer and supporter and this led to the creation of Kuji Kast early this year. As part of making the show, I follow all the happenings of Kujira on a daily basis as well as speaking closely with each protocol that either has or is planning to launch.    

## Personal Statement

I believe very strongly in what Kujira is doing and have the strongest desire to see it grow. Having spoken directly with each protocol and forged strong relationships with them I have gained strong insight into who they are, what they require, and what they intend to achieve. I plan to continue to do this with each emerging project. I believe I will add a different element to the Senate; I see protocols and the people within them as essentially assets. For Kujira to be special we need to attract the best; I feel sometimes we as a community can be critical of newcomers (as we need to be) but also I see a need to balance this and ensure we create a welcoming environment where the best people want to be.

685,"Community Health research, analytics, and benchmarking

## Summary
If Web3 is all about communities, how do we know if we're heading in the right direction?
We've been advancing a research project to:
* develop a framework for Community Health with actionable metrics
* create an open source data collection tool
* implement the tool in Cosmos Hub and others
* analyse the interactions and perceptions data to validate the framework and provide insights to advance the Cosmos community.
We're seeking $30,000 or equivalent as grant match-funding to complete the project.
For clarity, the output of this grant is a community health assessment (including conceptual framework, designing KPIs, building the data collection tool, etc). And a range of more specific, actionable insights on how to improve community health. We cant say what the specific insights are before doing the research, though.
## About RnDAO
We're an R&D DAO with a mission to empower humane collaboration. Having already delivered research projects on sub-DAOs, DAO Conceptual Foundations, Decentralised Leadership, DAO Compensation and more: http:// rndao.mirror.xyz
## Abstract
Like many others, Cosmos depends on the health of its community and its vibez—yet understanding and measuring these factors (what we call Community Health) is challenging.
Today, Web3 communities are left to rely on infrequent transactions data (on-chain records), while data from the significantly more frequent social interactions is limited to basic indicators of Discord or Discourse, Web2-oriented bots like Statsbot that give simplistic measurements, or a patchwork of “homemade” surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are ill-suited for DAO communities, surveys are time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results of these approaches, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.
Perhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders and members without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market crashes, protocol migrations, etc.).
## Specification
For the conceptual framework, we have assembled a team including two PhDs in network science and an organisation designer with significant DAO and community building experience to bridge both theory and practice. We've reviewed over 50 papers on the topics of Community, Social Network Analysis, Resilience, Trust, Engagement, and more. And are synthesising all of these findings to define the key indicators that have high validity and high predictive capacity for community health, while also taking a holistic perspective that accounts for member's wellbeing and planning to collect data across communities to offer an ecosystem health scrore too.
For the data collection tool, we're going beyond traditional surveys.
This research proposal focuses on the use of two critical techniques as a starting point:
Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how communications, information, and value creation occur through an organization based on interaction graphs. ONA has been shown to provide a wide range of insights to improve contributor retention, avoid member burnout, predict team performance and community resilience, identify key contributors, enable decentralization, and improve coordination. Although relatively new, ONA is gaining in popularity over traditional survey tools.
Pulse Surveys are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide qualitative and quantitative insights. In traditional organizations, they have been shown to increase employee response rate and employee engagement with related initiatives. They're also used as a tool for culture design and implementing culture change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys significantly reduce admin work for community managers and related roles. Importantly, these surveys offer an opt-out option from future prompts and are also framed to leverage coaching techniques to offer a prompt for reflection, thus offering value to participants as a recentering exercise on the value of community.
The data is anonymised and collected in a central repository for this first phase (we're exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a team having received ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should it be misused.
## Rationale
The techniques used (ONA based on communication and Pulse Surveys) provide maximum insights on Community Health compared with exclusively on-chain data analysis. And provide minimum disruption for community members and minimal admin compared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially, the techniques selected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation by those less likely to respond to long surveys e.g. those less engaged and thus likely with the most valuable feedback to give.
Although our initial focus is Community Health metrics, the proposed approach sets the foundation for further applications. Some of the potential applications and insights for Cosmos Hub and Cosmos-Chains-based DAOs are:
* Generate baseline metrics for Community Health / vibez to quantify and better understand the impact that a specific event is having on a community and/or sub-groups within the community
* Predict which contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive action (without breaching privacy
* Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for improvement
* Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or Insights metrics
* Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment, community experience, etc. in near real-time
* Attract talent and investment with objective Community Health metrics instead of proxy metrics like member count or proposal count, or financial metrics such as TVL
In addition to the initial research on Community Health, the potential applications mentioned above can enable more effective and targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities.

## FAQ
**What kind of insights can this proposal deliver?**
Although part of the work is precisely figuring out what metrics to use and which to discard, weve already spent significant time developing [a framework to define community and community health](https://rndao.mirror.xyz/F-SMj6p_jdYvrMMkR1d9Hd6YbEg39qItTKfjo-zkgqM) and will use this as our starting point, further refining with feedback from the community.
**How will the insights add value to Cosmos?**
A weak community will fall apart in the face of difficulties while a strong community will come together stronger. The insights enable the Cosmos community to understand which areas to target with initiatives so to improve community health. Instead of shooting in the dark, the insights provide strategic focus and clarity.
**Will this proposal have a continuation?**
This is very much the start of what could become an ongoing workstream of research and action. Were hoping the community is satisfied with this pilot so that we can then make subsequent proposals to both deepen the research further and action insights to make the community stronger.

**What reassurance can you provide for accountability?**
Were part of a DAO thats been around for over a year, and both the DAO and we, the leads of this proposal, have invested a hundred plus hours building up our reputation in the space with the names and social profiles we have disclosed. The reputational damage would cost multiple times the 30k being requested (not even counting the lost opportunity of building trust with the Cosmos community so we may make subsequent proposals). Of course, theres an uncertainty component, as with any R&D initiative, but you can count on us to do everything in our power to make this a success.",0

688,"JunoSwap Signaling Proposal: Allow permissionless listing of bridged assets from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge

This is a basic signaling proposal to all JUNO stakers for them to signal their support for or dissent against allowing the permissionless listing of Sifchain’s bridged peggy assets on JunoSwap. 

This proposal is being put on chain for all JUNO stakers to vote on after an 8 day long discussion period in the commonwealth and in lieu of official governance mechanisms on JunoSwap DAO, which are expected to launch alongside the RAW airdrop.   

Summary:
By voting “yes” on this proposal, Juno stakers signal their support for allowing tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge to be listed on JunoSwap. 

By voting “no” on this proposal, Juno stakers signal their dissent against allowing tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge to be listed on JunoSwap.

Context:
Sifchain’s recent Magnolia upgrade has made ERC20 tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge IBC compatible. This makes it possible to transfer ETH or any ERC20 token from Peggy to JunoSwap, enabling such pairs as JUNO:ETH and JUNO:RNDR. 

In the very near future, Sifchain will soon upgrade peggy to Omni-EVM, which will enable quick deployment of EVM bridges, and enable token pairs on JunoSwap such as JUNO:NEAR and JUNO:SOL.

Benefits:
Enabling assets from different, secure bridges, ensures that users of JunoSwap will not be limited by the token-selection of only one bridge. This is relevant because many innovative bridge solutions will launch in Cosmos, and being limited to only one bridge will reduce the amount of assets that can be swapped on JunoSwap – thus sending users elsewhere to make swaps.  

While it has been argued by other DEXes that this makes UX unpleasant, there are many work arounds to this. For example, truly permissionless listings for all assets have not stopped UniSwap from achieving over $10B in TVL. Improvements to UX are as simple as implementing a manage-tokens toggle (appended below).    

If this Proposal Passes:
The community supports the permissionless listing of assets that come from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge. 

Additional Information  :
In order to ensure that conflicts-of-interest do not play a role in the outcomes of this proposal, we would encourage any validators that have a vested interest in the success of another bridge and choose to vote to:  

a) state their biases
 b) abstain

693,"Takeoff Proposal from Cyber to Cosmos

cyber Congress (https://cybercongress.ai) developed Cyber (https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): a software for replacing existing internet behemoth monopolies, such as Google, which exploited outdated internet protocols using the common patterns of our semantic interaction. These corps lock the information, produced by the users, from search, social and commercial knowledge graphs in private databases, and then sell this knowledge back as advertisement. They stand as an insurmountable wall between content creators and consumers extracting an overwhelming majority of the created value.

We propose ATOM holders to invest 10,000 ATOM from the community pool into the Takeoff of Cyber. In exchange, at the end of its donation round (https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff), and when an IBC connection will become possible, cyber Congress will transfer CYB tokens back to the community pool. Passing this proposal will transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to cyber Congress multisig (https://www.mintscan.io/account/cosmos1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqv2tkd9a).

Full Proposal-Manifest text: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUYDQt9tqLQJwxnUck7dQY3XmZA3tDtpFh3Hchkg7oH46

or at https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff

The software we offer resembles a decentralized google (https://github.com/cybercongress):
- A protocol spec and the rationale behind it
- go-cyber: our implementation using cosmos-sdk
- cyber.page: PoC reference web interface
- launch-kit: useful tools for launching cosmos-sdk based chains
- cyberindex: GraphQL middleware for cyber
- euler Foundation: mainnet predecessor of cyber Foundation: the DAO, which will handle all the donated ETH
- documentation and various side tools

Cyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics core of the Internet. It does so by opening up access to evergrowing semantics core taught to it by the users.

Economics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.

You already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.

With the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.

Cosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.

A good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (с) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).

The solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.

This means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.

If this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will open another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in Game of Links (https://cyber.page/gol/) or Takeoff https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff independently. If you have question you can ask them either on Cyber topic on Cosmos forum (https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cyber-a-decentralized-google-for-provable-and-relevant-answers) or Cyber forum (https://ai.cybercongress.ai).

This proposal is intended to further bootstrap Juno liquidity on the Osmosis AMM.

By voting YES on this proposal, 250,000 JUNO from the community pool will be allocated to the JUNO/XKI pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

Allocate 250,000 JUNO to LPs on the JUNO/XKI pool
Distribution: 1388 JUNO/Per day for 180 days

The Ki Foundation will be matching this proposal with 6,250,000 XKI to LPs on the JUNO/XKI pool.
Distribution: 34722 XKI/Per day for 180 days.

Effectively the JUNO/XKI pool would have at least triple incentives:
1. Juno bonus incentives,
2. XKI bonus incentives,
3. Swap fees.

Should proposal #76 pass ( https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/76 ), the JUNO/XKI pool would have a unique quadruple incentives:
1. OSMO bonus incentives,
2. Juno bonus incentives,
3. XKI bonus incentives,
4. Swap fees.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s )

** IMPORTANT **

The requested funds will be sent to a ledger wallet set up and managed by Dimi (juno1x3zhtluc2vlt9n0szynhur06s07f6y609h429r) that will provide technical assistance in the creation of the gauges for incentives, funds will be allocated to the JUNO/XKI pair ONLY when the exact $ amount in bonus incentives is matched by the Ki Foundation.

Should for whatever reason the matching not be possible, requested funds would be deposited back into the Juno community pool.

698,"ATOM2.0 will split the community in half

## The community is split, 50% 50% if ATOM2.0 passes it will lead to a community split or a fork.

If we count only stakers direct vote on ATOM2.0 we get this distribution: 
Yes 12,964,821 ATOM
No 279,703 ATOM
NWV 11,830,808 ATOM 
Abstain 520361 ATOM
Clearly the proposal is extremely controversial, stakers are split 50% 50%, its also not popular as the majority of those 30k addresses are actually just bots using low balances and dust to influence perception of voters (snapshot as of Saturday) 
Seems like some external factors are influencing validators neutral representation of delegators.
If the vote were to be unbiased the validator vote would represent the same distribution as the stakers vote, so why we ask why the validator vote is skewed towards yes.
This justifies no with veto as a way for validators to protect the real interests of delegators, 50% of the delegator voting power is in disagreement its not a small minority.

## ATOM2.0 treasury allocation described by Zaki and Youssef

Dilute 44m ATOMs and split:

- Consumer chains 10%

- The other 90% (risky speculative bets)
1 Invest in Cosmos early ventures
2 LP positions 
3 token swaps
4 Lending
5 incentives to boost adoption of ATOM backed stable-coins 

Explain to us why this is not worse than Alameda, dilute other peoples capital and gamble with it.

If the 90% used for gambling were to be removed then we would be left with a 4/5m ATOMs needed to fund consumer chains a more reasonable target which would be easily funded without the need for dilution but rather through a higher community pool tax (the tax shouldn't be in perpetuity and we should target a test amount for the first year not the full 4m).

The part of the proposal about speculating with stakers capital on LPing, loans, etc.. should be removed or Cosmos will just end up being the Do Kwon/ Luna/SBF/Alameda/FTX/Su Zhu of next cycle.

ATOM 2 is just gambling:
- 50% of LP positions are at a loss https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09192
- 90% of LP tokens eventually become rugpulls https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07220
- VCs don't make money, 50% don't return 1x https://medium.com/the-mission/the-meeting-that-showed-me-the-truth-about-vcs-and-how-they-don-t-make-money-ab72b52b50cd
- Staking derivatives have extremely low profitability which doesn't justify the enormous risk and centralization pressure they impose on the hub, Eth staking derivatives cannot beat the yield of US treasuries, ETH/stETH is nominally at a loss and yielding less then 3%, ATOM staking derivatives have 3k daily volume which will translate in ridiculously low APR
- Liabilities are not revenue https://pastebin.com/fVQ81d7H FTT is a liability, when GAAP is applied. See current systemic risk. 

Not one of ATOM2.0 proposers has ever managed any money, nor they have consulted any money manager, they have zero history of AUM peformance.


## The ICF is behind ATOM2.0

ATOM 2.0 is a proposal by the ICF, no matter how much they deny, 2 ICF members (one senior) are cosigners (Ethan and Sam) we find it also very telling that they planned re-delegations at the same time as the ATOM2.0 vote, they will surely use those to reward compliant validators after the vote.
After ATOM 2.0 gets implemented it will strengthen the case for ATOM to become a security as the treasury will be profit seeking and revenue sharing and ICF might be regarded as the issuing party as they are the main entity behind the ATOM2.0 paper and were one of the biggest entities during the ICO genesis allocation.
Usually dilution is seen as the last alternative for financing and it’s a sign of a failing firm that can not gather funding in other ways, it’s the last chance, when you have no other option left, is the ICF solvent? 

Why does a centralized council need to be created when the community pool works just fine? See Evmos for example. 
Anything in Atom 2.0 can be done slowly, while Cosmos reaps the reward of ICS, while 90% of chains like Solana fail, Cosmos took the turtle approach and got rewarded by being one of the best performers in the last year, now ICS is about to launch. Let’s see how it develops before committing to a highly risky plan, and please lets not split the community, lets abandon controversial changes.

## Bio

I have nearly 15 years of experience directing operations and managing numerous grant programs for various public foundations. I spent a decade servicing a $30mil portfolio that administered community grants totaling more than $20mil in disbursements. I served in various leadership roles and participated in a myriad of committees responsible for the oversight of numerous multi-million-dollar disbursement programs. I also had the distinct pleasure of serving on the foundation's investment committee which was responsible for implementing spending and investment policies which ensured oversight of the organization's $500mil portfolio. I started my career as a Cost Accountant for an agricultural firm which generated over $100mil in annual revenue. I contributed to various day-to-day accounting functions, worked on numerous audit teams, and was directly responsible for overseeing and controlling numerous cost accounts. My education includes a bachelor's degree in finance, with a concentration in investment and real estate analysis, and I am skilled in, accounting, budgeting, portfolio management, compliance, auditing, and other unrelated community based and donor cultivation skills.

## Related Experience

I've managed multimillion dollar public portfolios, directly overseen the disbursement of tens of millions of dollars, served on and led countless committees responsible for disbursing millions in grants and appropriations. I have experience in all facet of grants management, including operations, governance, budgeting, and investment oversight. I've served in leadership roles responsible for creating, implementing, and overseeing spending and investment policies for investment portfolio's totaling over half-billion dollars.

## Personal Statement

I am certain that my background allows me to instantly contribute to the team as I bring a wealth of knowledge concerning best practices, responsibilities, and policies common with grant making organizations. I am confident that I can assist in some capacity and help ensure that this governing body is fiscally responsible, fair, transparent, and enabled to operate in perpetuity, thereby serving generations of Kujirains. Forever!

702,"Terra Stablecoin Infrastructure Proposal by Stably

Agora Post: https://commonwealth.im/terra/discussion/6700-terra-stablecoin-infrastructure-proposal-by-stably

This proposal outlines two solutions for the Terra community:

A natively-issued USD-backed stablecoin for Terra 2.0 ($USDS)

A fiat-to-stablecoin gateway for Terra dApps & wallets (Stably Ramp)

$USDS is issued via Stably and Prime Trust, our regulated trust company partner and qualified custodian. It is a compliant stablecoin that is backed 1-to-1 with USD funds held by Prime Trust, with monthly collateral attestations done by Cohen & Co. It securely bridges liquidity to the other blockchains that $USDS is issued natively on, such as Ethereum, Harmony, Stellar, and 7 more, with Ripple and Polymesh coming soon. 

Stably Ramp is a multichain on/off ramp widget that supports 200+ countries with a wide variety of payment methods accepted and lower fees than the competition. $USDS and Stably Ramp together not only bridge TradFi with DeFi but bridge the Terra ecosystem to many other emerging blockchains.

Please refer to the Agora post for a full summary, as well as questions addressed in the comments section.

We will also be answering additional questions via the Agora post as well as Terra’ Discord throughout the week.",0
703,"ATOM GROWTH DAO Growth & Developer Acquisition 2023

## Change log

* 2023-02-4 New post after a feedback cycle

## Summary

On-chain submission redacted for length. Read Full Proposal here: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVr8zLF4KWTTNQ2wAyuSHygfEURrg2nP33b6aXrd19uDE

On Dec. 19, 2022, Cosmos Hub [Prop 88](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-88-accepted-increasing-hub-community-tax/8267) was accepted, and a tax was created to fund the community pool, ongoing. This large pool of capital is used for ecosystem growth through grants, development, and community building.

This new tax signals that the community is not content with the growth of the Hub, specifically for maintenance, development, grants, and funding.

With the signaling proposal of the V9 Lambda launch, Interchain Security (ICS), consumer chains, and Replicated Security are quickly becoming reality. A new narrative is emerging for the Cosmos Hub, a sustainable stream of real yield to $ATOM stakers. The Cosmos Hub has seen the emergence of 54 appchains. 

The consumer chain narrative is new, untested, and relatively unknown to teams outside the Cosmos ecosystem. We will take on this challenge and change this.

Our 3 objectives:

1) Make over 1,000 developer teams Cosmos-aware. Create a developer and project awareness campaign around Replicated Security, IBC, and the consumer chain narrative.

2) Support Replicated Security. AlphaGrowth will find, educate, recruit, and deploy grants to 20 or more DeFi projects that will launch on consumer chains. We will help find, educate, and recruit 1–2 consumer chain candidates.

3) Map infrastructure and utility for consumer chains and map, foster, and communicate increases in ATOM utility.

## Details

For more than 18 months, AlphaGrowth has helped acquire developers and dApps on behalf of ecosystems. In 2022, we helped source thousands of conversations and 40+ dApps deployed on Aurora EVM. In late 2022, we began working with Kava EVM to drive adoption of the DeFi narrative. Within two months, we helped drive 14 new dApps to Kava and continue to drive 10–15 dApps each month. Example projects we brought to different chains: https://alphagrowth.notion.site/AlphaGrowth-Grants-Program-e8357b57a4c742509cd01cf81183d619

We have confidence we can help Cosmos Hub with awareness, execution, and impact.

706,"Fixing Centralization From Gamed Stakedrop

This is the account that gamed the fair stakedrop. 

 www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8 

 It has 2.5 million Juno instead of 50k (Which was the max per account)  

 One of the main reasons for this proposal is that this address has staked the majority to one validator. This action is centralizing the network. They also did not delegate until Juno started trading on Osmosis. This would indicate that it was done so that it would be impossible to just restart the chain with this amount changed to 50k. 

  They just started to redelegate 250k Juno to SG1, which is the second biggest validator I can only assume because of the backlash. SG1 is the 2nd biggest validator so they don’t seem to understand the concept of decentralization. By not fixing this issue now it will lead to long term centralized governance issues. 

 I propose that we blacklist/delete 90% of the Juno in this account. This action is not done lightly. By the time this proposal goes through, they will not have been able to undelegate in time to prevent the decision of governance. 

 By voting yes to this proposal you agree that the Juno tokens in this account be reduced by 90% and that  future blacklisting/reducing of coins should not be taken lightly.",0

724,"CORRECTED: Make JUNO Carbon Neutral by Purchasing Eco-Credits


This proposal replaces Proposal 83 which incorrectly displayed the $ amounts. Please ignore Proposal 83 and vote on this proposal instead.

Proposal:
Make JUNO carbon neutral by purchasing NCT eco-credits from Osmosis DEX
- Based on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, and applying Method #3 ‘worst case scenario’, JUNO Validators are projected to emit at most 3928 tons a year in carbon, scaled up to cover from the start of JUNO (March 2021 to December 2022 - 22 Months) this becomes 7,201 tons
- Based on analysis from working with the JUNO core team (analysis here), the core team's carbon footprint is estimated to be: 6762 metric tons of carbon emitted from March 2021 to December 2022
- This gives a total carbon footprint of 13,963 tones for the JUNO Network.

This proposal asks for a spend of JUNO 60,929 (USD $67,022 at JUNO price of $1.10) from the Community Pool to purchase 13,963 eco-credits and cover JUNO’s carbon emissions from March 2021 to December 2022
- Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval to address JUNO’s carbon emissions footprint by purchasing 13,963 Osmosis NCTs (USD $55,852 at $4 NCT). A 20% buffer will also be added to account for price changes (USD $11,170) any unused funds will be returned.
- Voting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated.

Method:
The required JUNO will be transferred to multi signature custodial account managed by:
- Jake Hartnell (JUNO Network)
- Daniel Pittman (Regen Network)
- Pete Hill (JUNO Validator)

The defined amount of NCTs purchased by the custodians of the multi-sig account, any funds remaining after this will be returned to the community pool.

728,"ATOM 2.0: A new vision for Cosmos Hub

## Summary\nWe propose a new Cosmos Hub vision document, a counterpart to the 2017 paper which focused primarily on the network of IBC-connected chains. With the creation of the Cosmos Stack (Tendermint, IBC, and SDK) and the development of key technologies for secure economic scaling (Interchain Security and Liquid Staking), the original vision of the Hub has been fulfilled. This document marks the transition to the next phase of the Cosmos Hub as an infrastructure service platform, and a renewed role for ATOM as preferred collateral within the Cosmos Network. It describes two pieces of app-specific functionality, the Interchain Scheduler and Interchain Allocator, which together form a flywheel for accelerating interchain growth. The Interchain Scheduler is a cross-chain block space marketplace, which generates revenues from cross-chain MEV. These revenues are used by the Interchain Allocator to capitalize new Cosmos chains, foster interchain collaboration, and thereby expand the total addressable market of the Scheduler. This paper also describes a new issuance regime optimized for Liquid Staking, where after a 36 month transition period, exponential issuance is reduced to a constant amount of ATOM issued per month. To administer the proposed plan, the paper describes the formation of Cosmos Councils, domain-specialized entities that carry out development and operations. Cosmos Councils together form the Cosmos Assembly, a body that is accountable to ATOM holders, responsible for setting yearly goals, resourcing, and administering work undertaken on behalf of Cosmos Hub.\n\nWe have included the paper below in its entirety for the community’s consideration.\n\n[The Cosmos Hub v1.2](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdC3YuZBUq5b9mEr3bKTDRq4XLcxafe3LHqDNFUgUoa61)\n\n\n## Authors\n- Sam Hart, Interchain GmbH\n- Zaki Manian, Iqlusion\n- Ethan Buchman, Informal Systems\n- Max Einhorn, Iqlusion\n- Jehan Tremback, Informal Systems\n- Youssef Amrani, Cosmos Contributor\n- David Feiock, Galileo\n- Jack Zampolin, Strangelove\n- Udit Vira, Hypha Worker Co-op\n- Sacha Saint-Leger, Hypha Worker Co-op\n- Kristi Poldsam, Iqlusion\n- Jelena Djuric, Informal Systems\n\n\n## Governance Votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n- YES - You approve of and wish to ratify the contents of the proposed paper\n- NO - You don’t approve of the contents of paper.

 By voting NO on this proposal, the community dissents on allocating 7500 OSMOS for developmental and marketing expansion to the Russian-speaking crypto space.

 The IBC Gang and Osmosis are almost completely unknown in the Russian-speaking crypto community. We propose to facilitate an expansion of Osmosis into the Russian-speaking crypto space, through marketing access to forklog.com, facilitating Russian-language content and providing developer support.
Summary of the proposal: ForkLog is the biggest Russian-language crypto magazine, working since 2014. Our website reports on everything in crypto and attracts about 1M readers monthly with over 6M monthly page views. With the funding we will do a series of articles and videos on Osmosis on Forklog.com. A more detailed overview of the exact services can be found in the attached full proposal.
The second part of the proposal is aimed at increasing the outreach to Russian-language developers. It includes a complete translation of the technical documentation of Osmosis (Gitbook, Docbook) into Russian and the establishment of Russian-language developer support on Discord from our developer James.

735,"Remove incentives from all xki pools

xki has some kind of system or user that trades once per minute or so, at fixed intervals, using the same amount of dollar denominated value.   The motive for this is likely the reality that osmosis currently incentivizes pools based on trading volume.  The automated system or tireless human is responsible for nearly all xki trading.

This activity has been entirely clear, and unless it suddenly stops, can be seen here:

https://info.osmosis.zone/token/XKI

XKI is being wash traded from at least two addresses, at a rate of around $1000 per minute:

737,"Allocate 125k Osmo from the OCP to give Support/Marketing access to guidance on business matters related to Defi, DAOs, and structuring.

This proposal is to allocate 125k OSMO to a multi-sig wallet controlled by members of the Osmosis Support Lab and Osmosis Ministry of Marketing.  The wallet will then delegate all funding to Redline validation in exchange for consulting services related to Defi, DAOs,and structuring.  This delegation will hold for a minimum of 6 months.  At the end of 6 months the two working groups will assess if we need to increase, decrease or undelegate funding.  Any funds not used for delegations to Redline will be sent directly back to the community pool.  When services are no longer needed or wanted, this funding will return directly back to the community pool.  This is a no loss scenario for the community pool, as the requested funds will never be spent or leave the multi-sig wallet except to be returned to the community pool. 

 The members of the OSL and OMM have vetted Redline and its services and their current engagements with many reputable teams and projects. At a high level Redline will be providing key services and recommendations to reduce major bottlenecks related to structuring recommendations, support, and logistical help. In fact they have already completed bodies of work. Given our previous unsuccessful efforts to solicit these services from various other vendors, Redline has already delivered better than expected results in a timely manner 

 This approach will be the first example of community funded consultation for community funded initiatives.  The delegation will ensure the two groups can confidently engage with adequate consulting teams necessary for them to have maximum impact with the funding allocated to them.  This service can be used by other working groups in Osmosis and is not exclusive to Support and Marketing.  We advise all teams and users to engage with Redline before committing any delegations as they will be a 100% validator 

 About Redline: 
 “Redline specializes in consulting services and helps crypto teams, foundations, and DAOs navigate through the unique hurdles presented to crypto and DeFi.  Our unique model provides access to top-tier talent without any out-of-pocket costs or traditional bottlenecks.   We are quick to execute an engagement, are fully transparent, and are tailored for the dynamic crypto environment.”

A 2nd simultaneous proposal will deploy this wrapper contract to add limits and stops to Osmosis.\n\nMore info at https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/6921-proposal-for-adding-limits-and-stops",0
744,"## Require a minimum 5% commission for all validator nodes

## Require a minimum 5% commission for all validator nodes.

### Reasoning: Competition drives innovation. Innovation drives sustainability and token value.
We should build a community where validators truly innovate and create value for delegators, rather than relying on their 0% commission to attract delegators. Allowing unsustainably low commission rates promotes spam and will not motivate validators to create innovative solutions for delegators, potentially stagnating the development of the Cosmos Network. 

Having a 5% minimum commission ensures that validators are incentivized to innovate to acquire delegators. This will also encourage greater decentralization on the Cosmos Network as validators compete for delegators based on merit (rather than 0% commissions). Additionally, it is necessary to provide proper incentives to validators for their work running and securing the Cosmos Network, especially during crypto winters. 

If this proposal is approved, the Cosmos Network would be updated so that:
1.  Existing validator nodes with commission rates set to less than 5% will have their commission automatically updated to 5%
2.  New validator nodes will have a floor commission rate of 5% 

### Vote: 
Yes – If you want to add a 5% minimum commission to encourage validators to innovate and add value for delegators, promote decentralization, and adequately compensate validators for their role in securing the network
No - If you want to leave Cosmos without a minimum commission amount",0

Allocate 60,000 OSMO from the community pool to a community multisig address. More information available here: https://gist.github.com/johnpatten1/182dfb0b12d1b68212a24a7f0bcb94fc",0
746,"ATOM 🤝 Osmosis:  Allocate Community Pool to ATOM Liquidity Incentives

ATOMs should be the base money of Cosmos, just like ETH is the base money of the entire Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. ATOM is currently well positioned to play this role among Cosmos assets because it has the highest market cap, most liquidity, largest brand, and many integrations with fiat onramps. ATOM is the gateway to Cosmos.

In the Cosmos Hub Port City vision, ATOMs are pitched as equity in the Cosmos Hub.  However, this alone is insufficient to establish ATOM as the base currency of the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Instead, the ATOM community must work to actively promote the use of ATOMs throughout the Cosmos ecosystem, rather than passively relying on the Hub's reputation to create ATOM's value.

In order to cement the role of ATOMs in Cosmos DeFi, the Cosmos Hub should leverage its community pool to help align incentives with other protocols within the Cosmos ecosystem. We propose beginning this initiative by using the community pool ATOMs to incentivize deep ATOM base pair liquidity pools on the Osmosis Network.

Osmosis is the first IBC-enabled DeFi application. Within its 3 weeks of existence, it has already 100x’d the number of IBC transactions ever created, demonstrating the power of IBC and the ability of the Cosmos SDK to bootstrap DeFi protocols with $100M+ TVL in a short period of time. Since its announcement Osmosis has helped bring renewed attention and interest to Cosmos from the crypto community at large and kickstarted the era of Cosmos DeFi.

Osmosis has already helped in establishing ATOM as the Schelling Point of the Cosmos ecosystem.  The genesis distribution of OSMO was primarily based on an airdrop to ATOM holders specifically, acknowledging the importance of ATOM to all future projects within the Cosmos. Furthermore, the Osmosis LP rewards currently incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs of the platform.

Osmosis has the ability to incentivize AMM liquidity, a feature not available on any other IBC-enabled DEX. Osmosis already uses its own native OSMO liquidity rewards to incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs, leading to ~2.2 million ATOMs already providing liquidity on the platform.

In addition to these native OSMO LP Rewards, the platform also includes a feature called “external incentives” that allows anyone to permissionlessly add additional incentives in any token to the LPs of any AMM pools they wish. You can read more about this mechanism here: https://medium.com/osmosis/osmosis-liquidity-mining-101-2fa58d0e9d4d#f413 . Pools containing Cosmos assets such as AKT and XPRT are already planned to receive incentives from their respective community pools and/or foundations.

We propose the Cosmos Hub dedicate 100,000 ATOMs from its Community Pool to be allocated towards liquidity incentives on Osmosis over the next 3 months. This community fund proposal will transfer 100,000 ATOMs to a multisig group who will then allocate the ATOMs to bonded liquidity gauges on Osmosis on a biweekly basis, according to direction given by Cosmos Hub governance.  For simplicity, we propose setting the liquidity incentives to initially point to Osmosis Pool #1, the ATOM/OSMO pool, which is the pool with by far the highest TVL and Volume. Cosmos Hub governance can then use Text Proposals to further direct the multisig members to reallocate incentives to new pools.

The multisig will consist of a 2/3 key holder set consisting of the following individuals whom have all agreed to participate in this process shall this proposal pass:

- Zaki Manian
- Federico Kunze
- Marko Baricevic

This is one small step for the Hub, but one giant leap for ATOM-aligned.

The ATOM 2.0 White Paper has been released, the goal of the writers is to try to shift the Cosmos Hub in a new direction, while enriching themselves and setting up limited checks and balances for stakeholders, who have taken all the risk since the inception of the network.
Given the extreme nature of the changes proposed, we decided to use the proposal system for better visibility, we think its fair given the circumstances.


The letter attached to this proposal should clarify our position on it, we think in its current state the ATOM 2.0 upgrade would be extremely damaging to the hub.

751,"Make JUNO Carbon Neutral by Purchasing Eco-Credits


Proposal:
Make JUNO carbon neutral by purchasing NCT eco-credits from Osmosis DEX
- Based on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, and applying Method #3 ‘worst case scenario’, JUNO Validators are projected to emit at most 3928 tons a year in carbon, scaled up to cover from the start of JUNO (March 2021 to December 2022 - 22 Months) this becomes 7,201 tons
- Based on analysis from working with the JUNO core team (analysis here), the core team's carbon footprint is estimated to be: 6762 metric tons of carbon emitted from March 2021 to December 2022
- This gives a total carbon footprint of 13,963 tones for the JUNO Network.

This proposal asks for a spend of JUNO 60,929 (7,022 at JUNO price of .10) from the Community Pool to purchase 13,963 eco-credits and cover JUNO’s carbon emissions from March 2021 to December 2022
- Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval to address JUNO’s carbon emissions footprint by purchasing 13,963 Osmosis NCTs (USD 5,852 at  NCT). A 20% buffer will also be added to account for price changes (1,170) any unused funds will be returned.
- Voting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated.

Method:
The required JUNO will be transferred to multi signature custodial account managed by:
- Jake Hartnell (JUNO Network)
- Daniel Pittman (Regen Network)
- Pete Hill (JUNO Validator)

The defined amount of NCTs purchased by the custodians of the multi-sig account, any funds remaining after this will be returned to the community pool.

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

757,"Incentivising UST and Luna on Osmosis exposes the ecosystem and stakeholders to significant regulatory and stability risk

Incentivising UST and Luna on Osmosis exposes the ecosystem and stakeholders to significant regulatory and stability risk.

In many ways UST is similar to Stripper Dollars:

1. UST adoption has to a large extent been driven by shady activities and circumvention of regulation. This includes enticing the wider public to trade regulated products without any consumer protection (Mirror Protocol) and luring savers with high returns without explaining the risk of losing the principal (Anchor Protocol) when/if UST collapses.
2. Like Stripper Dollars, UST provides no clear benefits compared to ""the real deal"", i.e. a USD backed stablecoin. Only Luna holders benefit from the minting of UST.
3. Stripper Dollars have a tendency to become worthless overnight. Algorithmic stablecoins have a similar track record.

Is UST really the best USD stablecoin for Osmosis? It seems like we could easily do better by adopting an existing USD backed stablecoin such as USDC.

When evaluating the commentary and voting on this proposal, keep in mind that key figures from in the Cosmos ecosystem are heavily invested in Luna and thus have strong economic incentive to see UST and Luna integrated in Osmosis, regardless of risk and long term consequences to the ecosystem.

Voting *YES* on this proposal signal that we, as the broader community,

1. Desire a more robust, better regulated and more transparent USD stablecoin for Osmosis, that is future proof. This could be USDC bridged from Ethereum or a similar mechanism.
2. Reject offering OSMO incentives for Luna and UST pools as it exposes the Osmosis community to regulatory risk from (at least) the SEC. If this proposal passes, it minimises the gauge settings from proposal #52 ""Add Incentives to Osmo/Ust and Osmo/Luna"".


Background:

Regulatory Risk:
Mr. Do Kwon is currently engaging in fisticuffs with SEC lawyers regarding the specifics of how (and if) he was served during Mainnet 2021. This seems like a feeble attempt to distract from what is really the larger play regarding UST and Luna.
https://www.scribd.com/document/534537134/Terraform-v-SEC

Even if the SEC is unsuccessful in shutting down Terraform Labs and it's services in South Korea, they can certainly persue U.S. entities offering trading and staking services around UST and Luna.

Offering incentives in the form of OSMO incentives for Luna and UST on Osmosis exposes the wider community (including validators) to this same level of scrutiny. If this is a concern for you, vote *YES* on this proposal.


Stability Risk:
Algorithmic stablecoins have historically imploded spectacularly once their supply decreases and they enter a death spiral.

This is also a likely outcome for Terra stablecoins and it might be an understatement to claim Terraform Labs are scrambling to sustain growth: An additional 3-4 billion UST is about to be minted.

 AmigoSound Radio 
 
 AmigoSound Radio will be a key feature of our platform. In addition to on-demand streaming, we will be focusing on discovery, and radio is a great way to make that process effortless. 
 
 Juno Community 
 
 How will our project benefit the broader Juno Community? 
 
 As a decentralized music streaming platform built on the Juno blockchain, AmigoSound could benefit the broader JUNO community by providing a new and innovative use case for the technology. By utilizing the speed, security, and decentralization of the Juno blockchain, AmigoSound could demonstrate the potential of the platform in the music industry and potentially attract more artists and fans to the Juno ecosystem. 
 
 AmigoSound’s decision to build its platform on the JUNO network will benefit the broader Juno community in a number of ways. 
 
 Additionally, the use of JUNO on the AmigoSound platform will increase the overall adoption and use of the network, which can help to increase the value of the JUNO token. 
 
 The allocation of 10% of the total $AMIGO token supply to JUNO stakers through an airdrop is also going to benefit the Juno community by providing additional value to its members and incentivizing them to hold and use JUNO.

CCN is currently reviewing possible Auditors which can validate that distributions of JUNO only go to valid CCN clients, who are real people, who are in full control of their wallets, of the proper amount based on their investment.

This neutral and independent Audit will help the community confirm that CCN clients are real individuals and ensures that funds only go to real people (and not fake wallets owned by CCN).

CCN Seeks early community sentiment on whether this effort will be acceptable prior to contracting an external Auditing Team.

A vote for Yes means that you agree to proceed with distribution to the CCN clients’ addresses if they are substantiated through a neutral third-party audit.

A vote for No means that you disagree to proceed with distribution to the CCN clients’ addresses even if it is substantiated through a neutral third-party audit.

The third-party (institution) will clarify as follows:
- Confirm which CCN clients had paid for CCN service by February 18, 2021
- Clarify the number of JUNO that each client can receive
- Ensure the client passes KYC
- Ensure the client has control of the receiving wallet address

The process after the lock will be as follows:
- Create a smart contract based on CosmWasm merkle-drop, modified to handle native tokens
- Import all the addresses that passed KYC in the smart contract
- Send funds from unity contract to new one
- Allocate tokens proportionally, let CCN clients withdraw independently from CCN

# Include CosmWasm in Rho Upgrade

## Summary

Signaling proposal to include CosmWasm on the Cosmos Hub in v8-Rho upgrade targeting Q2 2022. Further details and discussion at [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243).

## Details

This is a signaling proposal to include CosmWasm in the v8-Rho upgrade. The Cosmos Hub team at Interchain GmbH has done technical feasibility research by speaking with CosmWasm core contributors and validators to understand the burden of integration and believe it is technically feasible with resources in Interchain GmbH and Lido as well as regular advice meetings from Confio.

The instance of CosmWasm included on the Cosmos Hub will be governance gated and use Cosmos SDK v0.46.x. The governance feature set created by Confio, funded by [Prop 25](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/25), works so that all of the wasmd Message types can be executed by the chain’s governance module. These messages all otherwise have configurations so that they can be executed by one account, any account, or no accounts. Each message type should be set to “no account” so that it is only possible to execute messages with Governance. One alternative possibility that needs further review is whether to allow “one account” and designate it as the new governance module account to take advantage of the new features in the governance module coming in v8-Rho.

CosmWasm on the hub comes with benefits and drawbacks that deserve serious attention. A summary and background of the topic has been posted to [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243) where further discussion is taking place. Please visit and take these into consideration when voting.

## Governance Votes

YES - You approve this signaling proposal to include CosmWasm on the Cosmos Hub in v8-Rho upgrade targeting Q2 2022.

## Summary
The ION DAO has successfully gone through testnet and is now ready to launch onto the Osmosis mainnet.

Vote **YES** on this proposal if you want to instantiate ION DAO contract on Osmosis.  
Vote **NO** on this proposal if you do not want to.  

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.  

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).  

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig  

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.  

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features 
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee 
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list 
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal 
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description 
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%
