# Upgrade to v1.1.1 - Minimum 5% Validator Commission

In proposal 1, HUAHUA holders voted for validators to set their minimum commission to 5%. This proposal writes that informal agreement into code by upgrading the Chihuahua blockchain to v1.1.1. This upgrade will force existing validators to upgrade their minimum commission, and stops validators from changing their commission fee to below that of the minimum commission fee.


## Proposal Details

- At block 535000 (estimated time January 18, 16:00 UTC) Chihuahua will be upgraded to v1.1.1.

- New minimum validator commission parameter will be introduced, with an initial value of 5.0%
- Validators with less than 5% commission will be force change to 5%
- Validators will not be able to change below 5% in the futur

"Passage x Chihuahua Proposal

Goal 
 Develop a virtual world on the Passage platform that gives $HUAHUA token holders and MetaHuahua Holders a place to come together, interact and further build the community (see the commonwealth discussion: https://commonwealth.im/chihuahua/discussion/3894-proposal-for-chihuahua-passage-world) 
 
 Methodology 
 Passage would like to engage in a long term collaboration with the $HUAHUA community that allows us to immediately begin development on a community owned Passage World, while also leaving us room to expand features and functionalities as the Passage Platform matures. Included in this process will be the listing of MetaHuahua NFTs on the Passage Marketplace and the integration of those NFTs into avatars (or Huavatars) within the world. 
 
 Proposed Features for World Launch 
 ● World Design - We will work with community delegates to create a custom world built from the ground up for the Chihuahua Community. This world could be photorealistic or heavily stylized, but either way will lean into the full power of Unreal Engine. 
 ● Passage Integration - The designed world will then be converted by our team into a functioning Passage world. This means that the community will be able to play in the world on Desktop or Mobile devices through a browser without the need for any downloads. The world will be restricted to owners of MetaHuahua NFTs and $HUAHUA tokens. We will also be customizing the Passage UI to better fit the Chihuahuas brand/community aesthetic. 
 ● Social Functionality - Players will be able to add friends via wallet addresses to self organize and play together while communicating via chat and with custom Chihuahua emotes. 
 ● Avatar Customization - We will create chihuahua Huavatars for the community to use in conjunction with their MetaHuahuas. In addition to this, Huavatars will be customizable with a wide array of 3D accessory NFTs that will be purchasable within the world with $HUAHUA. 
 ● Custom Development of 3D MetaHuahuas - We will offer community members the opportunity to have their MetaHuahua made into a 1 of 1 metaverse avatar for use in the Chihuahua Passage World, as well as other Passage worlds. This avatar will be connected to the original MetaHuahua NFT, meaning it can be considered in the value of future NFT sales. This service would be done on a first-come-first-serve basis.
 ● 3 Minigames - What is a world full of Chihuahuas without some games to play and compete in? The world will launch with 3 distinct, dog themed minigames that allow players to compete with one another. Think King of the Hill, but with pups running around marking territory. 
 
 Additional Proposal Considerations 
 ● NFT Minting - The Passage team will complete the minting process with the MetaHuahua team to bring the NFTs into the Passage Marketplace and make them available to the community. 
 ● $PASG Private Sale - We will be bringing forward a second proposal in the very near future to provide the Chihuahua community with a Private Sale allocation of $PASG that will help fund player time and maximize accessibility to the world. 
 ● Security Audit - The Passage team will engage with a Cybersecurity firm familiar with CosmWasm contracts to conduct a full audit of the tech stack used to build the Chihuahua Passage World. While this will utilize our standard tech, there are also a number of features being custom built, so we’ll want to verify the safety and security of all users with a full audit. 
 
 Future Upgrades 
 This scope of work has been built so that the Chihuahua Passage world can grow with future additions as we add more features to the platform and the Chihuahua community grows. 
 
 Requested Funds 
 The Passage team is seeking 272,000,000 $HUAHUA (approximately $785,000 USD at the time of writing) in order to fully execute this initial scope of work. 
 Multisig Address: chihuahua1encclv5q4zg0xs6r5aent2j2r9mk5msyqw4ysj 
 
 Liquidation Schedule 
 While our team will need to liquidate funds in order to pay for development of the Chihuahua Passage World, we also want to be respectful of the $HUAHUA community and not actively damage the price by liquidating too much at once. Below is the liquidation schedule we would propose. Any funds not liquidated each month will be staked to support the network.

"Q2 2022 Inflation Update Proposal

As discussed in the commonwealth topic https://commonwealth.im/chihuahua/discussion/4188-signaling-proposal-for-inflation-change-discussion

We propose a change from the current flat 60% inflation rate to a dynamically and manually adjusted inflation much similar to the Bitcoin one.

Unlike Bitcoin halving happening every 4 years, we propose a quarterly reduction rate which will slowly decrease it by 4.20% each time.

If this proposal passes, the process will slowly reduce the inflation for the next 4 years (until 2026) slowly reducing the inflation until we meet the new minimum rate of 10%.

Reducing inflation will reduce the selling pressure (even though we are still above the launching price) and would benefit the long term holders and early investors penalizing speculators and airdrop chasers.

Every three months there will be a new proposal signaling the new Parameter Change and the community will be asked to confirm the path we are going to follow regarding this matter.

For our first proposal for inflation change, we are proposing the following changes:

Phase 1 (this proposal) is asking the community to burn 15B HUAHUA in a 30 days period (with a Burning Rate of 500M HUAHUA per day) using our Burning Smart Contract.

During this period we will monitor the burning impact and after 30 days we will submit another proposal based on the community feedback during the burning for the continuation of the Burning Process.

During these 30 days we will improve the burning smart contract in order to facilitate the burning directly through proposals and governance.

Let's VOTE

- By Voting YES you agree on the initial burn of 15B HUAHUA during a 30 days period and have another proposal after Phase 1
- By Voting NO you disagree with the proposal and signal your will not to burn 15B HUAHUA",0.003282018000635767

"Revision of CommunityDAO compensation / funding proposal (edited)

Please disregard the previous proposal, the amount is missing

Chihuahua community DAO has experienced some changes. Officially, the chihuahua community DAO is now 4 members. Currently, the team is made up of 2 co-leads, 1 junior lead, and 1 graphic designer and 1 accountant. We also recruited 2 new mods that belong to the Israel and Persian telegram, they are currently paid as well. We have a Turkish group as well. We’ve experienced a big change in $ value regarding Chihuahua DAO compensation. Currently the monthly amount that is being compensated to the team for their work is:

Leads get 1.5M each = 3M
Junior + designer get 1M each = 2M
Regional comm mods get 1M each = 2M
Turkish mod gets paid 600k HUAHUA
Our accountant = 240k HUAHUA

Which makes total of 7.84M HUAHUA / month. The last 3 months the whole payroll of the team has been in average close to 300 USD worth of HUAHUA. The amount of money we get compensated has been severely lowered. Also the last proposal was an extension for up to six months and we realized that was a mistake due to volatility. Conditions in the market change quickly and due to this, we would like to make a change regarding the funding period. We would like to change the DAO funding request period from 6 months back to 3 months.

The two leads will get $1.5K worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly  = $3K worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly in total.
Junior international managers/designer will get $1k worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly= $2K worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly in total.
Accounting manager will be paid 1k$ in HUAHUA tokens monthly. Regional mods will get $500 worth of HUAHUA tokens each monthly = $1.5k$ worth of HUAHUA tokens monthly in total. These payments will be split in half and paid out on the 15th and 30th. So, 3k+3k+1.5k= $7.5K worth of HUAHUA tokens each month (final value adding all the parts).


We have accomplished a lot for Chihuahua and continue to push the bar. We have been here for you and will continue keeping our promise, so we would appreciate the community considers this updated proposal. Some of the current stats achieved are:

* Multiple different telegrams with multiple languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Italian, Persian, Russian, Turkish, Vietnamese).
* Over 1200 followers  on Reddit.
* 3,000 followers in the ChihuahuaDAO Twitter account and even in bear market we are increasing the community.
* Multiple social media campaigns achieved.

We are moderating all platforms and constantly staying up to date with education and information. We have been trying to support the community as much as our abilities let us. Also we’re currently looking at different ways to connect with the community. Despite market conditions, we stay committed and passionate about the chihuahua community. We consider this isn’t a greedy proposal but a request we would highly appreciate the community understand will help us not only in the personal way but to incentivize more activities related to huahua. The team is also human and wants to be able to do their job without having to worry about volatility.
We already have ~92M HUAHUA in the our DAO multisig wallet. The wallet details can be found as under:

https://www.mintscan.io/chihuahua/account/Chihuahua19eyp4rq08030xn4f43dmmw8v7prk7rjajej5rl

We want to request additional 108M HUAHUA tokens to be sent to this multisig address:

chihuahua19eyp4rq08030xn4f43dmmw8v7prk7rjajej5rl

The reason why we are requesting more tokens than currently needed is due to having leeway incase HUAHUA price drops severely so that we can cover all the compensations in proposed dollar worth of amounts. These tokens will be sent to a DAO DAO multi-sig on JUNO network for better manageability. We will share the DAODAO multisig wallet details in coming days. This will be used to cover expenses. Over the burn period, we expect prices to go higher because of the burn, so we decided that whatever amount isn’t used will be returned to the community pool.
In the event we run short of tokens in these 3 months due to a drastic HUAHUA price drop, then a seperate proposal will follow for the remaining amount to complete the 3 months period of compensation.",0.004874486560417224

The process will slowly reduce the inflation for the next 4 years (until 2026) slowly reducing the inflation until we meet the new minimum rate of 10%.

Reducing inflation will reduce the selling pressure (even though we are still above the launching price) and would benefit the long term holders and early investors penalizing speculators and airdrop chasers.

"Chihuahua Community DAO Extension

# Chihuahua CommunityDAO Extension proposal

 Hey community,

 This Proposal requests **650M $HUAHUA** from the community pool to continue operations for the next **4 months**.

 Recently the DAO requested **200 million $HUAHUA** to pay for the team of the Chihuahua Community DAO. It's been two months and we are already running out of funding to pay wages for the Chihuahua DAO. The reason, we are running out of funds is downward $HUAHUA price movement. We recently have migrated our DAO funding operations on DAO DAO for the most transparency and efficiency. You can check the multisig via this link of what's been going on and how much $HUAHUA has been paid in $ value.

 [Chihuahua DAO Multisig](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1kvtefw5v6w0vlgurvhgjvmu2ny8vg8vy2lwdk9k3h547plh7j6gqvjcqaz)

 Now before we requested more funding; Due to the bear market and volatility of chihuahua, everyone was paid a couple dollars for their service on the DAO. We ran into a lot of issues with the pay; where the team was just uninspired. When we decided to make some revision's to the original prop; we also made some changes to the DAO. One Co-lead was replaced and a few junior admins were terminated. We originally felt the volatility of $HUAHUA would be an issue and we were right. There has been some strategizing in the payments going forward to prevent sell pressure. We've decided to make some pay cuts due to over whelming payments in $HUAHUA. We are planning to make changes where ever we see fit.

 We have decided to request four months in advance; Currently we have not finished the first 3 months, we have only finished two monthly payments and would like to request for the next 3 months on top of our 1 month that is missing payment. Currently, for the next 4 months at current wages; we are looking at more or less 320 million $HUAHUA to be paid out to all mods and admins. We have decided to request the amount of 650M $HUAHUA to make up for the volatility we may face in these times ahead. Now, we pay according to the dollar amount, so if the value of chihuahua goes up in the next 3 months; we will be leftover with a surplus. This surplus will be given back to the community pool no matter what.

 These are the list members in the DAO that are paid.

 Co-leads $1500
 * Karan $1500 a month
 * Nick $1500 a month

 Junior Leads
 * Callisto $600 a month

 All regional mods
 * Turkey mods(utku&hammer)125x125- $250 a month
 * Persian mod “Nice boy” $250 a month
* Israel mod “King” $250 a month

Accountant
* Mike barb, $750 a month.

 In our current term, we had nullnames and coldchain with because they are the tech team and helped us a lot with the DAODAO technical issues + multisig integration / txs.

 Mike barb is our accountant and he takes care of all the payments and monitors our multi sig.

 ## Accomplishments:
 In the current term so far, we have successfully organized AMA's with external teams such as StafiHub, done some Business and Development work, and we have continuously provided community management on discord, reddit and telegram along with spreading chihuahua chain awareness in our ecosystem using twitter and medium. The team also provided infographics, userguides for newbies and tutorials through the use of medium and twitter to provide informative content to those new and wanting to explore the chain.

 We believe, Chihuahua chain has come a long way from becoming USELESS MEME coin to 'a coin with USECASES' as we have helped in giving usecases to our beloved project for eg: rHUAHUA - StaFi liquid staking. More usecase are actively being developed and evaluated. We will continue to strive on adding more amazing usecases in future.

 After 4 months, of the 650M HUAHUA, we will only use approx. HALF of the funds IF we can manage to hover around these prices; Our intentions is to make sure that we can strategically improve chihuahua through the community DAO. We are also going to make some changes again in the future, if we think they seem fit. We appreciate your guy's support and will do the best we can to preserve the value of HUAHUA.

"Community Spend Proposal: Chihuahua NFT Marketplace

The Commonwealth discussion can be accessed [here](https://commonwealth.im/chihuahua/discussion/9715-huahua-permissionless-nft-marketplace). 

# Motivation
The most popular and essential applications on L1 blockchains are decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. These are highly likely to attract new liquidity and increase the number of users on a blockchain and generate the most transactions. They are also essential for users to trade their assets.

# Chihuahua's native NFT marketplace
As of February 3rd, 2023, Chihuahua Chain already have a DEX (White Whale) where you can trade different assets. Therefore, we believe the next essential application Chihuahua needs to have is a native NFT marketplace. Why is an NFT marketplace a good thing for a L1 blockchain? Just think about what OpenSea is for Ethereum. If we translate this to Chihuahua Chain, $HUAHUA could potentially become the hub of all memes and dogs NFT collections. It can also be the hub of any NFT collections.
How does an NFT marketplace creates value for a blockchain?
-  An NFT marketplace attracts new users and increases liquidity.
-  Non-fungible tokens have demonstrated to be a crucial element in the formation and strengthening of communities within an ecosystem. Strong communities contribute to a sense of belonging and engagement with projects and blockchains. Furthermore, an NFT marketplace is necessary if we wish to enable artists and projects to launch NFTs on the Chihuahua Chain.

Currently, there are several NFT collections related to the [Chihuahua Chain](https://www.chihuahua.wtf/nfts), but these are not on the $HUAHUA blockchain. By using ICS721 and CW721 compatible contracts, these NFTs could be transferred onto the $HUAHUA blockchain and have direct use cases. Although ICS721 is not yet available, it is expected to be in the near future.
In conclusion, a native NFT marketplace on the $HUAHUA blockchain would have multiple positive impacts on the ecosystem.

# Racoon Supply (proposer): Who are we?
Racoon Supply was launched in January 2022 and has since established a gaming platform on Juno Network and Chihuahua Chain. The platform has been utilized by over 2,700 unique players, with more than 2.5 million USDC played and over 9 million games played on the Racoon.Bet platform. The platform is owned by the $SCRT Racoon NFTs and overseen by a front-end and back-end developer. Racoon Supply also has a CW20 token, 90% owned by its community. In December 2022, Racoon Supply launched ""Dog Sanctuary,"" a play-to-earn game on the Chihuahua Chain. The team also assisted with the $HINU rekt drop by designing smart contracts and a decentralized application for users to claim their NFTs, which can be accessed here: [Mad Huahua](https://madhuahua.wtf/). For more information about Racoon Supply, please refer to the following.
- https://chihuahua.racoon.bet/
- https://www.racoon.bet/
- https://www.racoon.supply/
- https://twitter.com/RacoonSupply

# Our proposition
We believe that a native NFT marketplace on the $HUAHUA blockchain would attract new users and liquidity and help forming new communities within the ecosystem. To promote growth in the NFT scene on $HUAHUA, a diverse range of artists and projects is essential, and a dedicated NFT marketplace is necessary to establish and sustain a thriving NFT community. As Racoon Supply is not funded by external sources, we are requesting financial support from the Chihuahua Community Pool to develop an open-source, permissionless NFT marketplace. The marketplace will be accessible for projects to list their collections and for users to purchase and sell NFTs using any Cosmos-native coins with active IBC channels connected to $HUAHUA.

# Details of our proposal
Given that the Chihuahua Chain is still relatively young and has a small user base, we believe that introducing a basic non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace with essential features would be an effective way to establish an NFT presence on the $HUAHUA blockchain. As the user base grows and demands for new features arise, we can progressively enhance the platform and make adjustments as necessary.

### What the NFT marketplace would look like and how it would be implemented:
- **Visual**:
  - A search feature for collections
  - A profile page for each user
  - A section for featured and trending NFTs, as well as new listings
  - A coming up section, showcasing what's soon to be released on the marketplace

- **Unique page for each NFT collection**:
  - A project description, social media links, and additional information
  - Information such as total volume, floor price, and number of owners
  - A search function for NFTs within the collection, with the ability to filter by price and recently sold/listed
  
- **Unique page for each NFTs**:
  - It will display all of the NFT's information and include buttons for transferring, selling, and buying
  
- **How would it work**:
  - New collections will need to submit a pull request to have their information added to the frontend
  - Users will be able to buy and sell NFTs using several native assets that have active IBC channels from and to $HUAHUA. This will bring new assets to the $HUAHUA blockchain.
  - The marketplace will be permissionless with open-sourced smart contracts
  
# Funding from the community pool
In order to build the above NFT marketplace, we are requesting 650M from the Chihuahua Community Pool. This is approximately 65,000 USD as of January 28, 2023. These funds would be used over multiple milestones:

### Milestone #0 - Preparation and planning: (1-2 weeks)
  - 100M $HUAHUA up-front to start the project and pay the developers
  - Release of an official plan with deliverables and a roadmap for the community
  - Sketches of the dApp/UI and how the NFT marketplace smart contract will work
  
### Milestone #1 - Alpha version of the platform: (4-6 weeks)
- 200M $HUAHUA
- Local and testnet development
- An alpha version of the NFT marketplace smart contract
- An alpha version of the dApp/UI
- Gathering feedback from the community and users regarding the alpha version
- Smart contracts unit and integration testing

### Milestone #2 - Beta version of the platform: (4-6 weeks)
- 100M $HUAHUA
- A beta version of the smart contract and dApp/UI
- Users will be able to try and test the dApp and smart contract to provide feedback
- Simulation testing to test the scalability of the frontend and smart contracts

### Milestone #3 - Beta version 2 of the platform: (4-6 weeks)
- 100M $HUAHUA
- The final version of the smart contract and dApp will be released on the testnet and mainnet
- Release of test contracts on the mainnet for users to try and test the dApp and smart contract
- Gathering feedback and comments to deliver exactly what users want
- Final round of testing on the mainnet and finalizing simulation testing in a real environment
  
### Milestone #4 - Release: (1-2 weeks)
- 100M $HUAHUA
- The official release
- Gathering comments from users to make potential final updates/improvements

### Milestone #5 - Ongoing maintenance and small improvements:
- 50M $HUAHUA
- Ongoing maintenance and improvements

# Distribution of marketplace revenues
We believe that being funded by a community pool requires the beneficiary to implement a mechanism for returning money to the community pool. This makes the pool more sustainable and can be used by others. The revenues for the NFT marketplace are:
- 4.20% of all sales
- A listing fee of 6.9 $HUAHUA

Below is how we propose to return the revenues to the community pool:
- Until 420,690,000.00 $HUAHUA is returned to the community pool:
    - 75% of revenues will be sent to the community pool.
    - 24% will be burned. If the revenues are in another native denomination, a buy-back of $HUAHUA will be executed to burn the $HUAHUA.
    - 1% used for a recurring lottery among all wallets that have spent a given amount on the marketplace. For example, each wallet that has 100k $HUAHUA (value is taken as an example) volume on the NFT marketplace for a given amount of time gets a free lottery ticket. 

- After the 420,690,000.00 $HUAHUA has been sent back to the community pool:
  - 50% will be used for maintenance and future developments of the platform 
  - 25% will be sent to the community pool
  - 17.1% will be sent to Racoon Supply DAOs
  - 6.9% will be burned. If the revenues are in another native denomination, a buy-back of $HUAHUA will be executed to burn the $HUAHUA.
  - 1% for the recurring lottery (as explained above)

# Conclusion
In conclusion, we hope our proposal makes sense for everyone and that you understand the value an NFT marketplace brings to the Chihuahua Chain and the $HUAHUA communities. We welcome any feedback and comments to improve our proposal and align it with what the $HUAHUA community thinks would generate the most value.",0.02814316177426668

"Chihuahua CommunityDAO Extension: Usage of Excess Funds Introduction

The Chihuahua CommunityDAO has been an essential part of the Chihuahua chain's development and success. It has provided significant contributions to the community's growth and awareness of the Chihuahua chain through various activities such as community management, organizing AMAs, and providing informative content. Few months back, the DAO requested 650M $HUAHUA from the community pool to continue its operations for four months, where only 300M $HUAHUA was allocated to pay for the team. Due to the downward price movement of $HUAHUA, the DAO has already consumed some of the funds allocated for its operation for four months. In this proposal, we want to utilize the remaining 350M $HUAHUA to continue the Chihuahua CommunityDAO's function as the DAO of Chihuahua. Take note that this is NOT to request additional funds from the Community pool, but to use the excess funds in the DAO treasury [  https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1kvtefw5v6w0vlgurvhgjvmu2ny8vg8vy2lwdk9k3h547plh7j6gqvjcqaz ] requested by the last proposal: https://www.mintscan.io/chihuahua/proposals/37

"Don't Burn Deposits for Rejected Governance Proposals Unless Vetoed

Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRtR7qkeaZCpCzHDwHgJeJAZdTrbmHLxFDYXhw7RoF1pp

The Cosmos Hub's state machine handles spam prevention of governance proposals by means of a deposit system. A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders’ time having to review the proposal).

In the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.

We instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If >33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors.  This proposal does not make any change to the current behavior for proposals that fail to meet quorum; if a proposal fails to meet quorum its deposit will be burned.",0.00001777651446710493

"Notification for Security Critical Hard Fork at Block 482100

As described by user @Jessysaurusrex on Cosmos Forum in https://forum.cosmos.network/t/critical-cosmossdk-security-advisory/2211, All in Bits has learned of a critical security vulnerability in the codebase for the Cosmos Hub.  We deem the issue to be of high severity, as if exploited it can potentially degrade the security model of the chain's Proof of Stake system.  This vulnerability CANNOT lead to the theft of Atoms or creation of Atoms out of thin air. 

 All in Bits has released a source code patch, Gaia v0.34.6, that closes the exploitable code path starting at block 482100. 

 The proposed upgrade code Git hash is:  80234baf91a15dd9a7df8dca38677b66b8d148c1 

 As a proof of stake, we are putting some collateral behind this legitimacy of this bug and patch and encourage others familiar with the report to do so as well.  If the disclosed bug turns out to be fabricated or malicious in some way, we urge the Cosmos Hub governance to slash these Atoms by voting NoWithVeto on this proposal. 

 We encourage validators and all users to upgrade their nodes to Gaia v0.34.6 before block 482100.  In the absence of another public bulletin board, we request validators to please vote Yes on this proposal AFTER they have upgraded their nodes to v0.34.6, as a method of signalling the readiness of the network for the upgrade.",0.000000007350562010917845
"Increase Max Validator Set Size to 125

Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRhQycV19QiTQGLuPzPHfJwCioj1wDeHHtZvxiHegTFDd 

This proposal supercedes proposal number 9, which contains conflicting numbers in the title and body. 

In the Cosmos Hub, the total number of active validators is currently capped at 100, ordered by total delegated Atoms. This number was originally proposed in the Cosmos whitepaper section titled [Limitations on the Number of Validators](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#limitations-on-the-number-of-validators 4). This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet.  

However, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of <7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set.  

In the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases. Future increases to the validator set size will be originated through governance.",0.034255426738539395
"Are Validators Charging 0% Commission Harmful to the Success of the Cosmos Hub?

This governance proposal is intended to act purely as a signalling proposal.  Throughout this history of the Cosmos Hub, there has been much debate about the impact that validators charging 0% commission has on the Cosmos Hub, particularly with respect to the decentralization of the Cosmos Hub and the sustainability for validator operations. 

 Discussion around this topic has taken place in many places including numerous threads on the Cosmos Forum, public Telegram channels, and in-person meetups.  Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. 

 There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission.  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 

 This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum.  It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. 

 We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here:  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 

 Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. 

 The question on this proposal is “Are validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?”.  A Yes vote is stating that they ARE harmful to the network's success, and a No vote is a statement that they are NOT harmful.",0.10677656976410337

We are proposing to export the ledger’s state at Block Height 2,902,000, which we expect to occur on December 11, 2019 at or around 14:27 UTC assuming an average of 6.94 seconds per block. Please note that there will likely be a variance from this target time, due to deviations in block time.

We are proposing that the Cosmos Hub 3 genesis time be set to 60 minutes after Block Height 2,902,000.

Community-spend proposal submitted by Gavin Birch (https://twitter.com/Ether_Gavin) of Figment Networks (https://figment.network)

-=-=-

Full proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSMGEoY2dfxADPfgoAsJxjjC6hwpSNx1dXAqePiCEMCbY

-=-=-

Amount to spend from the community pool: 5250 ATOMs

Timeline: Q1 2020

Deliverables:
1. A governance working group community & charter
2. A template for community spend proposals
3. A best-practices document for community spend proposals
4. An educational wiki for the Cosmos Hub parameters
5. A best-practices document for parameter changes
6. Monthly governance working group community calls (three)
7. Monthly GWG articles (three)
8. One Q2 2020 GWG recommendations article

Milestones:
By end of Month 1, the Cosmos Governance Working Group (GWG) should have been initiated and led by Gavin Birch of Figment Networks.
By end of Month 2, Gavin Birch is to have initiated and led GWG’s education, best practices, and Q2 recommendations.
By end of Month 3, Gavin Birch is to have led and published initial governance education, best practices, and Q2 recommendations.

Detailed milestones and funding:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFEvMSLbiHoVAYqBq8lo3qQw3KtPMEqDFz47ESf6HEg/edit?usp=sharing

Beyond the milestones, Gavin will lead the GWG to engage in and answer governance-related questions on the Cosmos Discourse forum, Twitter, the private Cosmos VIP Telegram channel, and the Cosmos subreddit. The GWG will engage with stake-holders to lower the barriers to governance participation with the aim of empowering the Cosmos Hub’s stakeholders. The GWG will use this engagement to guide recommendations for future GWG planning.

Read more about the our efforts to launch the Cosmos GWG here: https://figment.network/resources/introducing-the-cosmos-governance-working-group/

-=-=-

_Problem_
Perhaps the most difficult barrier to effective governance is that it demands one of our most valuable and scarce resources: our attention. Stakeholders may be disadvantaged by informational or resource-based asymmetries, while other entities may exploit these same asymmetries to capture value controlled by the Cosmos Hub’s governance mechanisms.

We’re concerned that without establishing community standards, processes, and driving decentralized delegator-based participation, the Cosmos Hub governance mechanism could be co-opted by a centralized power. As governance functionality develops, potential participants will need to understand how to assess proposals by knowing what to pay attention to.

_Solution_
We’re forming a focused, diverse group that’s capable of assessing and synthesizing the key parts of a proposal so that the voting community can get a fair summary of what they need to know before voting.

Our solution is to initiate a Cosmos governance working group that develops decentralized community governance efforts alongside the Hub’s development. We will develop and document governance features and practices, and then communicate these to the broader Cosmos community.

_Future_
At the end of Q1, we’ll publish recommendations for the future of the Cosmos GWG, and ideally we’ll be prepared to submit a proposal based upon those recommendations for Q2 2020. We plan to continue our work in blockchain governance, regardless of whether the Hub passes our proposals.

"CosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades

CosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades

Community-spend proposal submitted by Ethan Frey (https://github.com/ethanfrey) of Confio UO (http://confio.tech/) and CosmWasm (https://www.cosmwasm.com)

-=-=-

Full proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC
Forum Post: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-cosmwasm-on-cosmos-hub/3629

-=-=-

Amount to spend from the community pool: 25000 ATOMs

Timeline: 2-4 months from approval

Deliverables:
1. Adding governance control to all aspects of the CosmWasm contract lifecycle to make it compatible with the hub. Allowing governance to control code upload, contract instantiation, upgrades, and destruction (if needed).
2. Adding ability to upgrade contracts along with migrations (also allowing orderly shutdowns). This controlled by a governance vote.
3. Launch a testnet with working version of this code (Cosmos SDK 0.38 or 0.39) to enable all interested parties to trial the process and provide feedback.
4. Provide sample contracts to demo on the testnet, along with some migration scenarios

Within 2 months, the working code and binaries should be delivered and open for public review. Within 4 months, these binaries will be used on a testnet, with sufficient staking tokens given to all active voters on the Cosmos Hub, and we will go through a few governance voting cycles to trial contract deployment and migrations (with a shorter voting cycles, eg. 3 days)

Detailed milestones in the full proposal:
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC

Beyond the milestones, CosmWasm will enhance documentation of the platform and offer technical support on our Telegram channel.

-=-=-

_Problem_
With the upcoming launch of IBC, the hub will need to adapt more rapidly to the needs of the ecosystem, while also limiting chain restarts, which may be detrimental to IBC connections. In particular support for relaying Dynamic IBC Protocols and Rented Security, using ATOMs as collateral for smaller zones, would greatly benefit from CosmWasm's flexibility.

_Solution_
We’re adding some key features to CosmWasm to convert it from a permissionless, immutable smart contract platform to a permissioned platform with governance control for upgrading or shutting down contracts. This is a key requirement to be able to integrate CosmWasm to the Cosmos Hub with minimal disruption.

_Future_
We will continue development of CosmWasm, especially adding IBC integration as well as working towards a stable 1.0 release that can be audited and safely deployed (Q3/Q4 2020).

"Stargate Upgrade Proposal 1

Stargate is our name for the process of ensuring that the widely integrated public network known as the Cosmos Hub is able to execute the cosmoshub-3 -> cosmoshub-4 upgrade with the minimum disruption to its existing ecosystem. This upgrade will also realize the Internet of Blockchains vision from the Cosmos whitepaper.
Integrations from ecosystem partners are at risk of breaking changes due to the Stargate changes. These changes drive the need for substantial resource and time requirements to ensure successful migration. Stargate represents a unique set of circumstances and is not intended to set precedent for future upgrades which are expected to be less dramatic.
There is a widespread consensus from many Cosmos stakeholders that these changes to core software components will enhance the performance and composability of the software and the value of the Cosmos Hub in a world of many blockchains.
A Yes result on this proposal provides a clear signal that the Cosmos Hub accepts and understands the Stargate process and is prepared to approve an upgrade with proposed changes if the plan below is executed successfully.
A No result would force a reconsideration of the tradeoffs in the Alternatives section and the forming a new plan to deliver IBC.

"Adjust Blocks Per Year to 4.36M

While the current inflation rate is set at 7%, the effective inflation rate is more like ~6.29%. This is because blocks have slowed down somewhat from ~6.5s to ~7.24s per block, and thus the current blocks per year value of 4855015 is too high. Here we propose to adjust the blocks per year value from 4855015 to 4360000 to bring it in line with current block times, which should realign the effective inflation rate.

"Governance Split Votes

In the Cosmos Hub governance system, each address can only cast a vote for one option (Yes/No/Abstain/NoWithVeto) which uses their full voting power behind that choice.

This proposal proposes an upgrade to the Cosmos Hub governance module that would allow a staker to optionally split their votes into several voting options. For example, a single address could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No. Clients may opt into supporting this feature, as the existing UX of voting for a single option is preserved.

This is beneficial because oftentimes the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company or organization that owns an address might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power.

Another example use case is exchanges and custodians. Many custodians and exchanges custody multiple customers’ ATOMs in the same address and use this address to stake on behalf of them. However, because of this, it makes it infeasible to do 'passthrough voting' and give their customers voting rights over their tokens, if different customers have different voting preferences. With this new proposal, custodians can use split votes to accurately reflect the preferences of their customers in on-chain governance.

The technical architecture for this feature can be seen in ADR 037 to the Cosmos SDK: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-037-gov-split-vote.md

"Inflation Rate Change Correction

The purpose of changing the network’s inflation rate is to protect it from unbonding shocks that threaten to compromise the security of the network. When the bonded ratio gets below the goal bonded ratio (currently at 66% on the hub) the inflation rate & effective yield of staked atoms goes up in order to incentivize holders to bond new ATOM’s, providing additional security to the network. Inversely, if we regain a desired amount of staked tokens, the yield will drop, decreasing effective yields for all delegators. Ideally the inflation rate starts changing fast, optimizing network security over monetary hardness. To figure out what an appropriate selection for the cosmos hub would be, I created excel sheets to run through all the different scenarios to find what value made the inflation rate react in an optimal manner. I came to the conclusion that 1 (AKA 100% per year is the maximum slope of the inflation curve) gave the most ideal characteristics, with the added benefit of simplifying the equation. I’ll give some examples on how it would react. Since unbonding is what we are protecting against, I will look at flash unbonds while the inflation rate is at the floor due to that being the #1 time of vulnerability.",0.000015152062070367123

"Governance Proposal for Gravity DEX Adoption to the Cosmos Hub

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt the Gravity DEX protocol on the Cosmos Hub. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding the Gravity DEX protocol on the Cosmos Hub.

### Background

In July 2020, the Iqlusion team developed ATOM 2021 to drive the direction of the Cosmos Hub after the completion of the Cosmos whitepaper and IBC. It became clear that providing liquidity to new IBC connected zones was core the Hub's mission. 

Tendermint ([https://tendermint.com](https://tendermint.com/)) and B-Harvest ([https://bharvest.io](https://bharvest.io/))  joined forces to produce and develop a Liquidity Module ([https://github.com/tendermint/liquidity](https://github.com/tendermint/liquidity)). In 2021 March, they submitted a signal governance proposal to ask the Atom delegator community about Gravity DEX (Liquidity Module) adoption on the Cosmos Hub. Prop38 was very well approved by the community ([https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/38](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/38)).

This proposal completes the first leg of ATOM 2021 and achieves the goals of the signaling proposal by bringing an IBC compatible DEX to the Hub.

### Ready for Production

With continuous quality improvement of the codebase, very wide test coverage, a codebase audit from Least Authority and Simply VC, and subsequent follow-up codebase strengthening, along with extensive simulation processes, we are now very confident to be ready for production utilization of the Gravity DEX (Liquidity Module) on the Cosmos Hub. The Gaia branch for the new release with Gravity DEX feature can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v5.0.0)). Please also check out the [github repository](https://github.com/b-harvest/gravity-dex-upgrade-test) for the launch testing of Gaia with Gravity DEX.

### On-Chain Upgrade Process

When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. And then, all validators and node operators have to substitute the existing state machine binary to the new binary with the Gravity DEX feature. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.

### Potential Risk Factors

Although Tendermint executed very extensive testing and simulation, and conducted in-depth audits, and followed up with the corresponding codebase improvement, there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new Gravity DEX feature. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately, and use the fixed state machine program provided by Tendermint.",0.04061917784516985

"⚛️  Add IBC Router to Hub ⚛️

The Hub has long been envisioned as a central point in the IBC architecture. In the battle to build and ship IBC this central vision has remained unchanged, but with so much focus on the need to build out other zones with real economies to support this network (the CosmosSDK is the result of this effort), the idea of the hub as an Interchain Router hasn't been discussed in a serious context for quite a while.

This is understandable: Cosmos needed so many other pieces to come together before the Hub had a chance to even start performing this function. Those other zones have been created, they each have products and economies. The bootstrapping era of IBC is well underway.

These new zones joining are noticing a problem: they need to maintain a large amount of infrastructure (archive nodes and relayers for each counterparty chain) to connect with all the chains in the ecosystem, a number that is continuing to increase quickly.

Luckly this problem has been anticipated and IBC architected to accomodate multi-hop transactions. However, a packet forwarding/routing feature was not in the initial IBC release. This proposal aims to fix this for the Hub.

This is a proposal to include a new feature to IBC on the Hub that allows for multi-hop packet routing for ICS20 transfers. By appending an intermediate address, and the port/channel identifiers for the final destination, clients will be able to outline more than one transfer at a time.

Strangelove Ventures has delivered an [IBC Middleware module](https: //github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/373) that will allow the hub to play the role of IBC Router that was always envisioned for it. Passing of this propsal will begin the era of the Hub offering interchain services to other chains and profiting from those relationships.

To pay the hub validators and stakers, this proposal implements a governance configurable fee (which we propose should be initially set to 0.0 to encourage adoption) that will be taken out of each packet and given to the community pool. The community pool will then periodically trade these fees for ATOM and distribute them to staked holders. The exact distribution method of these fees is left TBD in this proposal as it is not initially required and can be implemented in a future governance proposal. One way to do this would be using the [Groups module](https: //docs.cosmos.network/master/architecture/adr-042-group-module.html), Community spend proposals and the Gravity DEX.

A vote YES on this proposal indicates that this feature should be included in the next hub upgrade. We (as the Hub) believe that time is critical right now and we cannot wait to begin providing this service to other chains. A NO vote indicates that this shouldn't be included in the next upgrade.

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt gaia v6.0.0 which includes a number of updates, fixes and new modules. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.

### Background

Since the last upgrade at height 6910000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint. The following updates are included in gaia v6.0.0:
 * Bump [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.44.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) which notably includes fixes for the vesting accounts and two new modules outlined below. For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21)
     * Add the [authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. `x/authz` is an implementation of a Cosmos SDK module, per [ADR 30](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.3/docs/architecture/adr-030-authz-module.md), that allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). Authorizations must be granted for a particular Msg service method one by one using an implementation of the `Authorization` interface.
     * Add the [feegrant](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/feegrant/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. This module allows accounts to grant fee allowances and to use fees from their accounts. Grantees can execute any transaction without the need to maintain sufficient fees.
     * **NOTICE** It's imortant to highlight [PR #10041](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/10041) which impacts **WALLETS AND EXCHANGES**. This update has removed the deprecated the legacy REST endpoints for broadcast & encode. **This means `POST /tx` and `POST /txs/encode` no longer work**. Please see the [REST Endpoints Migration guide](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/migrations/rest.html) to migrate to the new REST endpoints.
 * Add [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) as a standalone module from the Cosmos SDK using version [v2.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). See the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md) for details.
     * Please note that the governance parameter for `MaxExpectedBlockDelay` is set to 30 seconds. This means if a connection is opened with a packet delay of 1 minute, it requires 2 blocks to be committed after the consensus state is submitted before the packet can be processed.
 * Add [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) [v1.0.1](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v1.0.1) as per [Proposal #56](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/56) prepared and tested by [Strangelove Ventures](https://www.strangelove.ventures/). This feature allows multi-hop IBC transfer messages so that a user can send tokens from chain A to chain C via chain B.
 * Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity) module to [v1.4.2](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.4.2) to ensure compatibility with Cosmos-SDK.

### Ready for Production

These changes have been extensively tested by various Cosmos Core Contributor teams including [Hypha Co-Op](https://hypha.coop/), [Informal Systems Co-Op](https://informal.systems/), [Interchain GmbH](https://interchain.berlin/), [Regen Network](https://regen.network/), [Strangelove Ventures](https://strangelove.ventures/), [Tendermint Inc](https://tendermint.com/) and more. The release candidate for this update was run as a local testnet and a public testnet with a successful upgrade; documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test).

### On-Chain Upgrade Process

When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor) to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Instructions specific to the upgrade can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/gaia-tutorials/upgrade-node.md). To test a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test/blob/master/local-testnet/README.md). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.

"Activate governance discussions on the Discourse forum using community pool funds

## Summary
Proposal to request for 1000 ATOM from the community spending pool to be sent to a multisig who will put funds towards stewardship of the Discourse forum to make it an authoritative record of governance decisions as well as a vibrant space to draft and discuss proposals.
## Details
We are requesting 1000 ATOM from the community spending pool to activate and steward the Cosmos Hub (Discourse) forum for the next six months.

Off-chain governance conversations are currently highly fragmented, with no shared public venue for discussing proposals as they proceed through the process of being drafted and voted on. It means there is no record of discussion that voters can confidently point to for context, potentially leading to governance decisions becoming delegitimized by stakeholders.

The requested amount will be sent to a multisig comprising individuals (members listed below) who can ensure that the tokens are spent judiciously. We believe stewardship of the forum requires:

* **Moderation**: Format, edit, and categorize posts; Standardize titles and tags; Monitor and approve new posts; Archive posts.
* **Facilitation**: Ask clarifying questions in post threads; Summarize discussions; Provide historical precedence to discussions.
* **Engagement**: Circulate important posts on other social channels to increase community participation; Solicit input from key stakeholders.
* **Guidance**: Orient and assist newcomers; Guide proposers through governance process; Answer questions regarding the forum or Cosmos ecosystem.
The work to steward the forum will be carried out by members of [Hypha Worker Co-op](https://hypha.coop/) and individuals selected from the community to carry out scoped tasks in exchange for ATOM from this budget.
## Multisig Members
* Hypha: Mai Ishikawa Sutton (Hypha Co-op)
* Validator: Daniel Hwang (Stakefish)
* Cosmos Hub developer: Lauren Gallinaro (Interchain Berlin)

We feel the membership of the multisig should be rotated following the six-month pilot period to preserve insight from the distinct specializations (i.e., Cosmos Hub validators and developers).
## Timeline and Deliverables
We estimate the total work to take 250-300 hours over six months where we hope to produce:
* **Moving summaries:** Provide succinct summaries of the proposals and include all publicly stated reasons why various entities are choosing to vote for/against a given proposal. These summaries will be written objectively, not siding with any one entity.
* **Validator platforms:** Create a section of the Forum where we collate all validators' visions for Cosmos Hub governance to allow them to state their positions publicly. We will work with the smaller validators to ensure they are equally represented.
* **Regular check-ins with the Cosmonaut DAO:** Collaborate with the future Cosmonaut DAO to ensure maximal accessibility and engagement. Community management is a critical, complementary aspect of increasing participation in governance.
* **Announcement channel:** Create a read-only announcement channel in the Cosmos Community Discord, so that new proposals and major discussions can be easily followed.
* **Tooling friendly posts:** Tag and categorize posts so that they can be easily ingested into existing tooling that validators have setup.
* **Neutral moderation framework:** Document and follow transparent standards for how the forum is moderated.

At the end of the period, we will produce a report reflecting on our successes and failures, and recommendations for how the work of maintaining a governance venue can be continuously sustained (e.g., through a DAO). We see this initiative as a process of discovery, where we are learning by doing.

For more context, you can read through the discussions on this [proposal on the Discourse forum](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-activate-governance-discussions-on-the-discourse-forum-using-community-pool-funds/5833).

## Governance Votes
The following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:
**YES** - You approve this community spend proposal to deposit 1000 ATOM to a multisig that will spend them to improve governance discussions in the Discourse forum.
**NO** - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form (please indicate why in the Cosmos Forum).
**NO WITH VETO** - You are strongly opposed to this change and will exit the network if passed.
**ABSTAIN** - You are impartial to the outcome of the proposal.

"Update expired client between Cosmoshub and Bostrom

This proposal will update the expired client on channel-240 between cosmoshub-4 and the bostrom networks. In turn, this will let users transfer  from bostrom, and to transfer  from cosmoshub back to bostrom.

By voting **YES**, the Cosmoshub stakers, voice their support to unfreeze IBC channel-240 between Cosmoshub and Bostrom.

By voting **NO**, the Cosmoshub stakers voice their dissent to unfreeze IBC channel-240 between Cosmoshub and Bostrom network.

**Details:**

Most IBC connections between Bostrom and other Cosmos chains have been relayed, to a large extent, only by the Bro_n_Bro validator.

Originally, channel-240 was created with a very short trusting period of 2 days. Alas, the lack of monitoring from our side caused the expiration of client 07-tendermint-497, which in turn, led to the impossibility to transfer tokens using channel-240. Currently, there are around 710 ATOM stuck on the bostrom chain, belonging to about 20 different accounts.

As this might be the first case, when a channel renewal on cosmoshub-4, happens via a governance proposal, we have set up prior testing to ensure that everything will work smoothly. We also modified test-suite https://github.com/bro-n-bro/ibc-testbed (thanks to the Lum devs for the awesome repo), so everyone could simulate the client renewal using governance with this test suite.

In the case that this proposal goes through, client 07-tendermint-497 state will be substituted by the state of client 07-tendermint-643.
Also if passed - channels 240-5 (cosmoshub-4 - bostrom) would be used, only, to recover the stuck funds. New channels would be created with a longer trusting period to ensure further stability.

We will be happy to answer any questions at our [Telegram community group](https://t.me/bro_n_bro_community) or on our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/868962876721860638/870738846772514826).",0.006110545964352232

### Potential Risk Factors

Although very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v6.0.x).",0.0011442905081113415

Make Cosmos Hub the Lead Sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022

Summary:
If this proposal passes, 2600 ATOM will be allocated to the Cosmoverse team - making the ATOM community the lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022. The Cosmos Hub was the first lead supporter for Cosmoverse 2021 and we would like to keep it that way for this one as well. Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world.

Description:
Cosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 27 & 28, 2022.

Our goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.

Cosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

Where do the funds go?

The sponsorship will help us finance the Cosmoverse conference. 

The main costs include:

Conference venue
F&B (conference + afterparty)
Marketing leading up to the event
Audio and visuals
Official afterparty
Legal costs
How does it benefit the ATOM community?

By allocating 2600 ATOM from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, the Cosmos Hub will become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.

Keynote speech: If this proposal passes, we offer three keynote slots to core Cosmos contributors. We will keep you updated on this topic on the official Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website.

Logo placement: The ATOM logo will be shown as “lead sponsor” on the main conference days. We will make sure everyone at the conference knows that the ATOM community has significantly contributed to covering the conference’s costs and making this a great event.

General Admission Tickets: We will give 15 general admission tickets to the ATOM community. Distribution TBD.

Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.

Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

Event Highlights 2021 and What To Expect

Cosmoverse 2021 took place in Lisbon, Portugal. The conference brought the Cosmos community together and kick-started new developments in the interchain! The attendees were provided with food, beverages, and merchandise and were able to listen to keynotes/ panels that were held by Cosmos thought leaders. Cosmoverse is the most community-driven Cosmos conference in the world! It is organized by and for Cosmonauts. 

This means low ticket prices and no VIP areas. If you attend the conference, you have direct access to all speakers and can ask them questions. 

Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia, and will have the same community vibe - but it will be much bigger! 

There will be many Cosmos speakers at the event, two coffee breaks per day including an assortment of food, two 5-star buffet lunches, an NFT room, a public co-working zone, private meeting rooms for sponsors and their teams, and much, much more. We will be able to provide twice as many tickets as the first conference. Medellin is a vibrant city settled in between a beautiful valley in the heart of Colombia. With many activities besides the ones we will be hosting throughout the week. We will ensure that within the Cosmoverse week, attendees will have the possibility to visit side events and meet Cosmonauts from all over the world!

The Team:

Cryptocito: Cryptocito is the most prominent Cosmos YouTuber in the interchain! Who is responsible for bringing all the cosmos together, through outreach, and planning of the event.

Basil Naser: Basil is part of the Cryptocito team. Last year he founded the Cosmoverse conference with Crypotcito. He is responsible for event operations and branding.

Fabian Klauder: Fabian is the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES, a Cosmos-focused media company. He is responsible for the financing of the event.

Juri Maibaum: Juri the Co-Founder of DEFI TIMES and host of the company’s podcast and YouTube show called “This Week In Cosmos”. He is responsible for outreach and bringing cosmos projects to the conference.
For Updates
We have 5 months to plan this one (for Cosmoverse 1.0 we only had 5 weeks) - so you know it will be epic.

You decide:

By voting “Yes” you believe that the ATOM community should become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

By voting “No” you think that the ATOM community should not become the lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.

"Establishing a definition of NoWithVeto

*Authors: Lexa Michaelides, Mai Ishikawa Sutton, Sacha Saint-Leger, Sam Hart, Udit Vira*

Download the full IPFS pin of proposal (including detailed technical and historical context) [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVHVH9WeGy9tTNN9dViqvDn7N79XJJUseKXD1rpyLVckK).
See active discussion on the forum [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898).

# Summary
This proposal aims to put forward a clear definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ that provides a stand-alone reference for future Cosmos Hub votes. We examine the technical context and existing discussion on ‘NoWithVeto’, and the range of ways the community understands NoWithVeto. We bridge these ideas into a coherent and thorough definition proposed below.

If passed, changes will be made to the Cosmos Hub documentation and Cosmos Hub Forum templates to reflect the newly accepted definition.

# Proposed Definition for NoWithVeto

***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***

Note: In this definition we use the term “rules of engagement” to refer to practices adopted by the Cosmos Hub community through governance. These may include decision-making processes and social protocols that have passed governance and thus been accepted as rules.

The following is factually correct about how ‘NoWithVeto’ currently operates and will continue to operate regardless of this proposal’s outcome: If quorum is met and greater than 1/3 of participating voting power have voted ‘NoWithVeto’, the proposal fails and is considered to be vetoed. In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.

# Discussion
## Summary of existing definitions
This list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.

1. **As a stronger No:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.
2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.
3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.
4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).
5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.
6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.

## Censorship
It may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3% of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2% of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.

## Financial and social cost
‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2% of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.

Consequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. 

While there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.

# Conclusion
We are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.

Cosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.

# Voting options
We propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:

***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***

Your vote on this proposal indicates the following:
* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.
* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal. Please indicate why in the [Cosmos Hub Forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898).
* **NO WITH VETO** - ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.
* **ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.",0.1327583380436859
"Fund incentives for the Interchain Security Incentivized testnet – Game of Chains – from the Community Pool

## Summary
This community pool spend proposal seeks approval to fund **20K ATOM** worth of incentives for the incentivized Interchain Security testnet – Game of Chains – coming to the Cosmos Hub, expected in November 2022.
## Background
Interchain Security (ICS) is a Cosmos SDK capability that has captured the mindshare of the Cosmos Ecosystem for well over the last year. This has been reflected in the engineering efforts by various core entities including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems as well as initial users Quicksilver and Neutron. ICS allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain.
ICS is a complex technology that needs to be rigorously tested. To ensure successful rollout, we are launching an incentivized public testnet where Cosmos Hub validators can participate and build confidence around this technology. Game of Chains will build on the Cosmos Hub’s legacy of running successful adversarial testnet programs in the past including [Game of Zones](https://github.com/cosmosdevs/GameOfZones) and [Game of Stakes](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/).
We believe the community will see ICS as a valuable addition to Cosmos Hub for three core reasons. First, it allows for “hub minimalism.” By deploying features on a consumer chain instead of Cosmos Hub, we keep the hub lightweight and reduce the surface area for attacks and vulnerabilities. Second, Interchain Security lowers the barrier for ATOM aligned app chains to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Instead of arranging their own validator set, new app chains can utilize the Cosmos Hub’s existing validator for security. And lastly, Interchain Security accrues value to ATOM and enhances its utility. As new Interchain Secured zones launch, gas fees on these new chains flow back to ATOM stakers through the Hub’s validators.
## Incentivized Testnet
For a successful launch, validators will need to prepare and train for expanding their node operations and governance efforts for every new Interchain Secured chain starting up. We are proposing an incentivized public testnet program that will serve the dual purposes of (1) testing Interchain Security in mainnet-like conditions and (2) providing Cosmos Hub validators the opportunity to build confidence around running the Interchain Security protocol.
In order to prevent delays and adequately prepare for launch, we believe it is critical for all Cosmos Hub validators to participate in this public testnet. For this reason, we’re seeking community approval for 20K ATOM (approximately USD 300k) withdrawn for the community pool to reward validators participating in the Cosmos Hub testnet.
* From this prize pool, 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for Cosmos Hub validators who complete Interchain Security testnet milestones. These milestones will be published at the launch of the testnet.
* The remaining 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for bonuses to validators who help identify bugs or performance issues or help develop new tools and monitoring solutions at the discretion of the jury
* Funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig committee
* Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool

"Adan: non-profit fighting for sound crypto regulation

# Adan: non-profit fighting for sound crypto regulation

## Summary

- Adan is a non-profit organization representing the crypto-asset industry in Europe
- Since 2020, Adan has worked relentlessly to fight disproportional and overreaching regulations which threaten the crypto industry's ability to innovate
- We seek 8,000 ATOMS in funding to hire a European Affairs Officer as we ramp up operations in Brussels

## About Adan

Adan is a non-profit trade organization representing the crypto-asset industry. Our members are crypto-native companies and firms that provide industry-specific expertise (legal, consulting, marketing, etc.)

Founded in France in 2020, Adan has over [195 members 6](https://adan.eu/en/association/members) in France and Europe across several industry verticals, including DeFi, payments, market making, custody, data analysis, and security, and is the largest crypto trade organization in Europe.

Adan interacts with all stakeholders with interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.

Our unique positioning allows us to rally decentralized DeFi actors and more traditional listed companies and corporations.

### Mission

- Educate about crypto and help create better narratives around this technology and industry
- Foster an environment favorable to the growth of the industry
- Accompany the implementation of French and European regulatory frameworks adapted to the specificities of the sector
- Build constructive relations between the industry and public institutions

### Funding

Adan is a membership organization and is funded primarily through annual fees.

Being aware that our missions concern not only the Cosmos community but the whole crypto ecosystem, we will ask for grants from other blockchains. Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.

Finally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.

### Governance

Members define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.

See our website for more information about Adan's governance and [Board of Directors 3](https://adan.eu/en/association/governance).

Adan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).

### Works & Publications

Adan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.

Adan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.

In just two short years, Adan has produced an astounding amount of writing and [publications](https://adan.eu/en/publications) to support its mission:

- [A crypto-euro issued by an American giant, or how Europe is delegating its monetary sovereignty](https://adan.eu/en/tribune-les-echos-crypto-euro-en)

## Proposal details

The crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.

To this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:

- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.
- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.
- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.
- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).

To overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:

- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda
- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups
- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)
- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests

Given the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.

## Deliverables

We believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.

This report will be delivered to you via this forum. It will consist of different sections, such as :

- actions carried out in the last months;
- missions to be carried out in the coming months;
- distribution of the remaining allocation.

## Funding Amount

Total amount requested: 8,000 ATOM

This corresponds to roughly 100,000 EUR and covers gross salary, recruitment costs, and travel expenses for half a year.

"Parameter Change: Increase Deposit Amount for Cosmos Hub Governance

# Increase Deposit Amount for Cosmos Hub Governance

## Proposal Deposit Concept:

* For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be submitted with a deposit of the amount defined by the **min_deposit** param in the governance module before the deposit end time.
* A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single wallet, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.
* The proposer account is only required to deposit **~1 ATOM**.

## Proposal to Increase Deposit Amount:

By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit costs **64 ATOM** or approximately **640** in **USD** equivalent, which currently appears to be inadequate at preventing spam proposals and may not be high enough to encourage more thoughtful approaches towards proposal submissions.

With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to **250 ATOM** or approximately **2,500** in **USD** equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance. This proposal deposit price adjustment aligns more closely with recent parameter changes that other chains within the Cosmos have made.

## Important Note: 

Community Members *must not* be priced out of making proposals on chain. **250 ATOM** is likely a large enough deposit to deter spam, while still being within the reach of most community members to campaign for a deposit, or provide one themselves.

Multiple wallets may fund a proposal deposit, so this remains within the ability of most Cosmos Hub users to campaign for and crowdsource funding from other community members and validators, wherever a good proposal may exist, but funding for a deposit is lacking.

## Voting:

* By voting **YES**, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 64 ATOM to 250 ATOM.
* By voting **NO**, you disagree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 64 ATOM to 250 ATOM.
* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
* Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.

"Increase the Community Pool Tax on the Cosmos Hub - Parameter Change

# Increase Community Pool Tax Rate

*Authors:* [Simply Staking](https://twitter.com/SimplyStaking)

## Summary

The aim of this proposal is to increase the community tax rate from the current 2% to 10% with the aim of increasing inflows to the community pool in order to help with future funding that brings utility to the Cosmos Hub.

## Background

Over the past couple of weeks, there have been a lot of fruitful yet sometimes heated discussions regarding the funding model for the Cosmos Hub.

‘Why do we need to create a treasury’ was asked regarding a proposed overhaul of the tokenomics model of the Hub and oftentimes the general consensus would be that it’s to future proof funding for the Cosmos Hub and anything that would need to be built or funded. The proposed solution was to have a direct mint of tokens to a treasury pool.

However, the Hub already has a Community Pool that has been used in the past for various community spend proposals. This pool is funded through taxation on a per-block basis. The current tax rate is 2%. By increasing this we can achieve a similar outcome of expanding the pool of funds available for public good funding, without the immediate creation of a new entity or the bulk minting of ATOM.

This proposal aims to increase inflows to the Community Pool to make it more in line with what we see around the ecosystem and to ensure that funding for future endeavours are secured. This is merely just a first step and more improvements will come later.

## Community Pools comparison

As a chain, the Cosmos Hub has a fairly small community pool compared to its market capitalisation:

Cosmos Hub - 1.24M ATOMs ~ $13M / Market Cap $3.1BN

Osmosis - 52.13M OSMO ~ $60.4M / Market Cap $560M

Juno - 15.73M JUNO ~ $37.3M / Market Cap $150M

Stargaze - 445M STARS ~ $20.5M / Market Cap $60M

Looking at other projects across the Cosmos Ecosystem, the Hub has a small community pool compared to its market cap at just 0.41%.

Looking at other ecosystems similar to that of Cosmos, we can find Polkadot (DOT). Polkadot has a market cap of $6.7BN dollars with a treasury pool of roughly 38M DOT which equates to $230M. This figure equates to 3.4% of its total market cap. This large pool of funds is used to fund the growth of the ecosystem through grants, development funding and also community building.

On the Cosmos Hub these sorts of proposals are hard to come by due to the limited amount of funds of its community pool, and also social cost required to engage with the community. The ATOM 2.0 proposal suggested that a Treasury be created and be bootstrapped with 4M tokens at with every approved vote up to a maximum of 10 tranches. Ultimately the idea of initially minting 4M to the community pool came into the limelight. However, various community members were still uneasy about minting such an amount due to dilution effects.

The system as it is currently has its flaws but also works. Until consensus on that solution is found regarding the future of inflation and if / when ATOM becomes deflationary, we, **Simply Staking**, are proposing increasing the community pool tax from the current 2% to 10% as that will help bootstrap the community pool organically without too much compromise to inflationary yield.

## Community Pool Tax

Current rate of Issuance: 9.6ATOM per block according to x/mint

Current amount of blocks per year: 4,360,000

Instead of the current 0.192ATOM being transferred per block to the pool with the 2% tax, with a tax rate set at 10% we would see around 11,460 ATOM per day (0.96 ATOM per block) get moved to the community pool. Over a year this would allocate around ~4.2M ATOM to the community pool.

## How will this increase affect staking rewards?

With every block, staking rewards are minted. A percentage of those rewards are diverted to the community pool and then the rest to the stakers. Increasing the tax rate from 2% to 10% will decrease the rewards that stakers will receive by around 8% (from roughly 21% right now to 19.4%)

The premise here is that the value generated by a strong community pool, public good funding and ecosystem development will vastly exceed the yearly single digit % loss in rewards by stakers.

"Cosmos Ecosystem News Videos

## **Cosmos Ecosystem News Videos**

## **Summary**

- Cosmic Validator is a long-term Cosmos ecosystem focused validator that started validating the Cosmos Hub in 2019 itself, during the first year of mainnet launch
- We seek 300 ATOM in a monthly funding, for a period of 6 months to continue producing high quality Cosmos Hub & ecosystem news videos

## **Cosmic Validator**

We have been really involved within the Cosmos ecosystem and its community for several years already before the Cosmos Hub launch or the Game of Stakes. We were amongst the first validators in the Cosmos Hub since 2019 and we have been actively participating in governance since then, currently being one of the validators with the highest governance participation in the Cosmos Hub. We are also participating in the Game of Chains to help testing the upcoming Interchain Security. We are fully committed and focused on the Cosmos ecosystem, we are validating only networks within the Cosmos ecosystem.

## **Funding**

The Cosmos ecosystem news videos project, at the time of writing this proposal, has no funding such as grants or sponsors. If the ICF grants program would reopen in 2023 then we would apply for a grant and if successful then the Community pool funding would be stopped and replaced with the ICF grant.

## **Work already produced**

Since the launch of the project in July 2022, a total of 11 videos have already been produced. Below are some examples of educational/in-depth assessment content in previous videos:

- Mekatek, Game of Chains, ibc-go v6.0.0: [https://youtu.be/l1DCLKp-Ww0](https://youtu.be/l1DCLKp-Ww0)

## **Proposal details**

The Cosmos ecosystem, with the launch of IBC, has grown significantly and it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of all the important developments and updates. While news is shared on several platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Telegram, Blogs and others, the information is very spread and usually challenging for stakeholders to find it and avoid missing some important updates. Some projects exist trying to gather and put together the main news, however these are mostly news headlines without in-depth assessments or educational content.

Keeping Cosmos stakeholders aligned and informed about important developments in areas such as governance, new technical features, project launches and upgrades or conferences is important and helps to have more constructive discussions.

Our goal with the Cosmos ecosystem news videos is to both educate and keep the broad Cosmos ecosystem community and stakeholders well informed, as well as helping to onboard new users to the ecosystem and increase the awareness about the advantages of building with Cosmos tech.

## **Deliverables**

There will be two monthly Cosmos ecosystem news videos produced, so for the initial 6 months period a total of 12 videos will be delivered.

## **Funding amount**

Total amount requested: 300 ATOM monthly for an initial period of 6 months, with a renewal if all deliverables are completed.

This corresponds to roughly 3,000 USD monthly and covers the production costs for two monthly Cosmos ecosystem news videos, including research and content preparation, filming and the required equipment, video design and additional operational costs.

"Cosmos Hub Open Source Funding Policy

This proposal was discussed on the cosmos Hub Forum here: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-hub-open-source-funding-policy/8566

We propose the following rules related to all funding decision made by Cosmos Hub funding bodies requesting funds from Community Pool:

Projects receiving funding to deploy chains/consumer chains MUST open source Chain binary code (and any associated smart contracts deployed by the core team receiving funding) prior to mainnet launch.
Wallet projects where users store their private keys and interact with the chain MUST be open source to receive funding.
These requirements exist to protect users. If the conditions for open source compliance are not met, all funding for the project should be immediately halted. Once open source requirements are met, outstanding funding will be provided as previously agreed.

Furthermore these additional rules shall apply to:

Community pool may only fund open source projects
Future grants from community fund treasury may only fund projects where every component is open source.
Moreover, as a chain built entirely on public goods, we emphasize that all Cosmos funding should prioritize projects that are entirely open source.

By voting YES you approve that we should adopt the funding policies described above

By voting NO you disapprove of the proposal

By voting ABSTAIN you ABSTAIN from making a ruling.

"Fund Incentives for the Interchain NFTs Public Incentivized Testnets of Game of NFTs

# Fund Incentives for the Interchain NFTs Public Incentivized Testnets of Game of NFTs 

# Summary 

The Game of NFTs (GoN) is an event proposed as a joint effort by multiple Cosmos teams, aiming to test the Interchain NFTs feature and build applications on top of it, which will have 2 phases: a) public incentivized testnets and b) a hackathon. This event is expected to happen in Q1 2023.

This is a community pool spend proposal seeking approval to fund **20000 ATOMs** worth of incentives for the Game of NFTs **Phase 1 - Interchain NFTs incentivized testnets** - to reward participants.

# Background - Interchain NFTs 

The Interchain NFTs technology can facilitate interoperability and expands the capabilities of IBC by allowing cross-chain NFT interoperability between IBC-enabled chains, which is the work of multi-team efforts supported by the Interchain Foundation. 

With collaborative efforts from ICF, IRISnet, Gravity Bridge, Stargaze, Ark Protocol and many community teams, it has Cosmos SDK and CosmWasm implementations that can be easily adopted by Cosmos SDK Chains including Cosmos Hub or CosmWasm Chains to expand their interconnections across the ecosystem. 

In November 2022, the first IBC NFT transfer between two test chains using different implementations of ICS721 was successfully executed on testnets. This marked a significant step forward for the IBC NFT ecosystem demonstrating the NFT interoperability between Cosmos SDK (Go) and CosmWasm (Rust) chains. 

NFTs have now captured the attention of various industries as well as Cosmos stakeholders. Similar to fungible tokens, if NFTs are just tied to one blockchain, the number of transactions and size of the NFT market would be restricted. To remedy this and unleash the next level of Cosmos NFT, high connectivity and interoperability are required. This is where Interchain NFTs enter the picture. We believe that Interchain NFTs and the community collaboration around them are expanding the mindshare and market share for Cosmos. 

More details about Interchain NFTs: [Interchain NFTs are Coming to Cosmos | by Interchain | The Interchain Foundation | Medium 4](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/interchain-nfts-are-coming-to-cosmos-e01e3abe3d37) 

# Game of NFTs 

The Interchain NFTs technology requires rigorous testing with the community involved. To boost the IBC NFT ecosystem, we’re proposing to launch a Game of NFTs event, which will build on the success of previous programs including [Game of Stakes 6](https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes) and [Game of Zones 1](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/), as well as the ongoing [Game of Chains 1](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022). The event is expected to have two phases: 
* Phase 1: Public Incentivized Testnets, for chains and service providers to test around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around February 2023. 
* Phase 2: A Hackathon, for developers to create tools, dApps and use cases around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around March 2023. 

## Public Incentivized Testnets - Phase 1 

Many talented teams are contributing to the IBC NFT ecosystem, and have plans to deploy this Interchain NFTs technology. To facilitate wide adoption and successful deployment to capture more value to the Interchain, Phase 1 of the Game of NFTs event is designed to provide mainnet-like environments for purposes on a) testing the performance and capability of Interchain NFTs feature, and b) building trust in Interchain NFTs and preparing for its deployment in the mainnet environments. 

The Interchain NFTs technology is crucial to facilitate interoperability and use cases of IBC, and will capture more value and use cases for both Cosmos-SDK and Wasm chains in Cosmos. By bringing this proposal up, we believe in the Interchain, Cosmos Hub is always a pioneer that takes the lead to pays attention to innovative technologies and public goods that can enhance IBC, Cosmos SDK and more underlying technologies, which is crucial to Cosmos Hub, Cosmos chains and also the Interchain. We would like to bring more value to the Interchain and there is no better way to do this than by having support from Cosmos Hub to Cosmos teams and communities to join the testing and improve this technology jointly. 

For this reason, we believe it’s crucial to have testnets environment for Cosmos teams and communities to participate, as well well to reward participants who help contribute through the testing to the Interchain, we’re seeking community approval for 20K ATOMs withdrawn for the community pool as incentives for the GoN Phase 1 - Public Incentivized Testnet. 

* 50% (10K ATOM) of the prize pool will be reserved for Phase 1 participants who complete Public Incentivized Testnet tasks with a set point system that is allocated based on their scores. These tasks and the point system will be published at the launch of the testnet. 
* The remaining 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for bonuses to Phase 1 participants who help identify bugs or performance issues or help develop new tools and monitoring solutions at the discretion of the board of judges 
* Funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig committee 
* Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool 

Game of NFTs is a joint effort by the Interchain ecosystem, so certainly, in addition to the support from the Cosmos community pool to advance the infrastructure and underlying technology, there will be various support from Cosmos projects such as IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno and other teams, and also from organizations such as IDG Capital and HashKey Capital. There will be multi-team support from their community pools, to sponsor the prize pool of Phase 2 Hackathon that is boosting applications on top of this infrastructure and technology. 

Through collaborative efforts of the Cosmos teams and community, this whole event will bring out verified Interchain NFTs infrastructure and technology that can be simply used and adopted by Cosmos chains, and prompt the creation of various pioneer applications using the technology, which together will create a complete IBC NFT ecosystem from bottom-up for the Interchain, and quickly expand the mind and market share for Cosmos.

"A Grant Program for the Cosmos Hub: Funding the ATOM Accelerator DAO



<B>Summary</B> 

With a properly funded community pool (following prop 88), we believe it is the right time to launch one or more grant programs to serve community contributors and builders around the Hub. 
This is a community spending proposal seeking approval to fund 588,000 ATOMs for the ATOM Accelerator DAO Grant Program.

<I>Note:</I> The program was formerly referenced as Cosmos Hub Grant Program (CHGP) and Orbital DAO.

<B>Grant Program Overview</B> 

With the ATOM Accelerator DAO, we seek to boost community participation and unlock its collective intelligence by encouraging individual and team-based initiatives. 
The ATOM Accelerator DAO offers an alternative, native source of funding for the Cosmos Hub and removes some of the burden on public governance. 
This program has more funding flexibility and also allows proactive allocation of capital through the development of in-house investment themes in collaboration with the community.

Grants will focus on open source code, public goods, and ecosystem initiatives that create value for ATOM holders.

The existing Hub issues that can be solved through this program are:
 - Insufficient funding of public goods;
 - Idle capital in the community pool;
 - Growth risk aversion;
 - Low support of teams already growing the Hub; and
 - Losing developers to other L1s.

The grant program solves these problems through:
 - Liaising between decentralized teams;
 - Minimizing risk through due diligence;
 - Supporting teams already growing the Hub;
 - Bringing new developers to the Hub and;
 - Efficiently deploying capital to ensure R&D & growth at the Hub.

<B>The Team</B> 

<B>A. Reviewer Committee</B> 
A team of 7 will be on the Reviewer Committee in charge of allocating grants. These 7 people will each play a functional role on the team, with the goal of creating a high-performance team, and also will steward the Multisig ensuring accountability in the approval of grants.  

<B>- Program Manager:</B> <a href=""https://twitter.com/youssef_amrani"">Youssef Amrani </a>. Core contributor Cosmos Hub, Economic Committee of IST stablecoin, previously community analyst at Messari. To lead program structuring, strategy & outreach

<B>- Program Manager:</B> <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-o-05853/"">Better Future </a>. Previously ran Ripple Accelerator. 20 years in software, incubators, accelerators and seed investing; Stanford Ph.D. To lead program structuring & team processes.

<B>- Technical Lead:</B> <a href=""https://twitter.com/lukedelphi"">Luke Saunders </a>, Chief Technology Office at Delphi Digital (Labs). Incubated projects like Astroport & Mars Protocol on Terra.

<B>- Reviewer:</B> <a href=""https://twitter.com/mikeyjhlee"">Mikey L </a>, Business Development at Cosmostation (currently also Multisig on Osmosis Grant Program)

<B>- Reviewer:</B> <a href=""https://twitter.com/0xave"">Xavier Meegan </a>, Chief Investment Officer at Chorus One

The Reviewer Committee will be supported by a Program Coordinator, <a href=""https://twitter.com/The_BendyOne"">Ben Davis </a>, who brings 15 years of digital marketing experience and will assist with website, marketing, community and program processes.

<B>B. Oversight Committee</B>
The Oversight, Accountability & Transparency Committee represents an opportunity to raise the bar and improve trust within the community. Oversight and accountability have often proved to be missing pieces in blockchain governance. That is why we want to adopt an innovative approach where there is an oversight and accountability function built in from day one as an integral part of the grant program and not something that would be implemented ad hoc. 
By establishing a flow of information about workings and status of Atom Accelerator DAO Grant Program, the entire Cosmos community can then be in a position to evaluate the efficacy of the program.  The Oversight team consists of three members: 

<B>Senior:</B> <a href=""https://twitter.com/mrjasonchoi"">Jason Choi </a>:  Founder of angel investing collective Tangent. Hosts the popular Blockcrunch podcast. Formerly General Partner at Spartan Capital.

<B>Auditor/Controller:</B>  <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricia-mizuki-b6334a5a/"">Patricia Mizuki </a>, formerly PwC auditor, over 10 years in audit, risk management and process improvements.

<B> Coordinator:</B>  Recruiting underway

<B>TIMEFRAME</B>

Here are the different steps we envision for the implementation and bootstrapping of the ATOM Accelerator DAO Grant Program:

<B>- Months 0-2:</B> set up the organization, create the program & workflows, setup website and proposal intake system, and build-up social media presence

<B>- Months 2-9:</B> Grant program in full steam, proposals are coming in, being reviewed, and being funded, and most of the budget is assigned to grants

<B>- End of Month 9:</B> Oversight committee to produce the grant program end of mandate report
Following the grant program end of mandate report, the community can either (a) Maintain confidence in the team behind the grant program and renew the mandate, or (b) Terminate the program, in which case unspent funds are returned to the community pool

<B>OUR STRENGTHS</B>

The strengths of our program are as follows:
Experienced & special-purpose team
Oversight function for community transparency
Support a plurality of grant-programs and can liaise and coordinate effectively
Primary goal to drive value for ATOM

<B>Amount</B>

588,000 ATOMs

<B>Note on Amount</B>

The amount of ATOM requested represents less than 2 months of community pool replenishment rate following prop 88 which increases the tax from 2 to 10%.

# v8-Rho Software Upgrade

## Summary

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt Gaia `v8.0.0`. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.

This upgrade does not include the Replicated Security feature; that will be part of the v9-Lambda upgrade.

The forum post discussing this upgrade can be found [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/upcoming-interchain-accounts-bugfix-release/8911/8).

#### Background
Since the last v7-Theta upgrade at height 9283650 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to Gaia.

**Updates**
- Bump [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to `v3.4.0` from `v3.0.0` which includes a fix for the interchain accounts vulnerability. See the full [Changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v3.4.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.
- Bump [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to `v0.45.12` from `v0.45.9`. See the full [Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.12) and [Commit History](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/compare/v0.45.9...v0.45.12) for details and updates between the last version of the SDK used in Theta. 
- Bump [Tendermint](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to `v0.34.24` and replace with the [Informal Systems fork](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to ensure software continuity.
- Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity) to `v1.5.3` which notably includes updating Go to `1.18` and the Cosmos-SDK to `v45.11` to ensure compatiblity with the Cosmos Hub.
- Bump [Packet Forward Middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) to `v3.1.1`  from `v2.1.1`. Users should note that PFM was not configure properly in the previous version of Gaia. This module update includes necessary bug fixes to make it functional on the Cosmos Hub in v8.

**Features**
- Add the [Global Fee](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/main/x/globalfee) module to the Cosmos Hub, which enables setting transaction fees at the network level via `param-change` governance proposal. For more information, see the [module documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/modules/globalfee.md).
- Add the `debug bech32-convert` [command](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/1845), enabling users to convert any bech32 string to the cosmos prefix. 

**Fixes**
- Fix Bank Denom Metadata [issue](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/1892). In a previous upgrade, the `x/bank` metadata was incorrectly migrated, resulting in an incorrect bank metadata. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L19) for more information. 
- Fix Quicksilver ICA exploit detailed in the [forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/upcoming-interchain-accounts-bugfix-release/8911) on the incident. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L58) for more information.

**Tests**
- Add a [suite of E2E tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/release/v8.0.x/tests/e2e) to ensure core features of the Cosmos Hub work as expected.


#### Testnet
V8 Rho went live on the persistent testnet after the successful simulated upgrade. For more information, see the testnet [upgrade proposal](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/proposals/112) or [block explorer](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/), and visit the [persistent testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public).

#### On-Chain Upgrade Process

This upgrade can be performed in multiple ways. When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically *before* swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.

#### Potential Risk Factors

Although very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v7.1.0).",0.0009014765784803869

## Summary
Allnodes is a validator on the cosmos hub, and offers insecure custodial VaaS on the Cosmos Hub, which is harmful to the economic and security interests of the cosmos community at large. Passing this proposal formally criticizes Allnodes for engaging in practices that are harmful to the Cosmos Hub.



## Voting Options
**YES** - Formally censure allnodes.com for offering insecure VaaS services on the Cosmos Hub.
**NO** - Do not formally censure allnodes.com for offering insecure VaaS services.
**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of 'NoWithVeto' votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.
**ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

"Aid Proposal for Earthquake Survivors in Türkiye

Aid Proposal for Earthquake Survivors in Türkiye

On 02.06.2023, two catastrophic earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.6 and 7.8 occurred in the Kahramanmaraş in Turkey. In addition to Kahramanmaraş, many earthquakes and aftershocks were experienced in Adıyaman, Kilis, Şanlıurfa, Diyarbakır, Adana, Osmaniye, Gaziantep, Malatya and Hatay. According to the statement made by Japanese earthquake expert Shinji Toda, “We can say that the Kahramanmaraş earthquake is the largest earthquake in the world to have occurred on land. 
6207 buildings were destroyed, and many buildings became unusable. More than 13 million people are affected. According to the statement made on February 9, the loss of life is 17406 and the number of injured is 71806. 

We need the support of many people from all over the world in this catastrophic event, which has been declared a Level 3 Emergency by the World Health Organization.

Although it is a great humanitarian need, we are aware that this proposal puts a great burden on all voters and may put them in a dilemma, but we had to take such route due to the urgency of the situation. In addition to being a support that prevents great pain, this proposal unfortunately opens a door for opportunistic people to use it in the future. It creates a great moral dilemma as to who will receive and how much support, or whether to give support to anyone who asks for it. In order to prevent this, it is of great importance for the good of the whole cosmos that the next charity proposals must be run through a Charity DAO. That's why we're asking for both your support and the establishment of a Charity DAO. And again, the reason why we did not establish this proposal through the Charity DAO is that every passing second is costing a human life.

The funds will be transferred to the Ihtiyac haritası (https://www.ihtiyacharitasi.org/ , https://www.needsmap.coop/ ), which is one of Turkey's most reliable non-governmental organizations, which still continues its search and rescue activities in the earthquake zone. The Cosmos Account of the Ihtiyaç haritası has been approved by the T.C. Financial Crimes Investigation Agency “MASAK”. Since the account has been opened on the local crypto exchange (Paribu), funds will be transferred to the organization's Paribu account via multisig. In order not to harm the Cosmos ecosystem, the funds received will be converted into Turkish lira by Paribu (the crypto exchange in Turkey used by Ahbap and Ihtiyaç haritası for the funds) without being sold on the market, and Paribu will use these funds as liquidity.

"Confio Public Goods Funding - Tranche One

## Summary
This is a community spend proposal. If it passes, it will transfer the ATOM equivalent of $1.25M  to support the Confio team in their stewardship of CosmWasm, CosmJS, and many other related repos. This is 95 697 ATOM at the current 30-day moving average price.

 This is based on a forum discussion about providing a total of $2.5M of support in two tranches to Confio. Confio will most likely apply for a second tranche in August, but the size requested will be adjusted by any other funding we have secured in the meantime, as we are applying for other sources.

Forum Discussion: [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-13-confio-public-goods-funding/9677/2](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-13-confio-public-goods-funding/9677/2)

## Purpose
*Strengthening the ATOM Economic Zone through support and Public Goods.*

Confio is the team responsible for the stewardship and development of a huge number of libraries fundamental to many developers in the Cosmos. The best known are the CosmJS & CosmWasm libraries, two key components of the Cosmos software stack, but you can review the [list of dozens of repositories](https://github.com/confio/funding/blob/main/Repositories.md) Confio maintains. These libraries are highly valued by developers and chains across the Cosmos ecosystem. In addition, they focus on expanding IBC protocols by developing IBC-enabled contracts and training others how to do so as well.

Confio is also prepared to offer some services and support for the success of Cosmos Hub secured consumer chains in exchange for such funding support. This will be defined more below, but it should be clear that there are also tangible benefits for the Cosmos Hub through this proposal. ## Use of Funds
Confio currently has a burn rate of circa 230k USD/month with around 90% of outgoing payments going to salaries. All funds from this proposal will go to pay salaries of employees. Principally developers, but also marketing/community building work (for the conference) and internal support (HR / accounting) needed to keep the company running.

Our headcount has been reducing and as of the end of February 2023, we will have 20 employees, including 10 developers and 1 product owner (one more if Ethan gets to code again and stop fundraising). To achieve this roadmap while performing a proper level of security and maintenance work, we will need around 25 people focused on Public Goods.

## Spend Details
Amount: 95697 ATOM

Recipient: cosmos12jnhpa3kemykq5mg8er27lmkj39yksgf3nr9tw (Confio GmbH)

Timeframe: 6 months ## Voting
* If you vote yes you signal your desire to compensate Confio via the Cosmos Hub community pool.
* If you vote no you signal your dissent against compensating Confio via the Cosmos Hub community pool
* If you veto this proposal you deem it harmful to the network and wish to burn the proposer's ATOM.

"Fund notional to work on the Cosmos Hub

This is funding for maintenance of the variety described here for 3 years from the date of passage.


Summary

Notional is requesting funding of 40,000 Atoms per year, for 3 years, for Hub maintenance and incident response. In return for this payment, Notional will monitor the Cosmos Hub for potential vulnerabilities on a 365/24/7 basis. When we become aware of an ongoing vulnerability, we will coordinate with relevant teams (SDK, IBC, Comet/Tendermint, Cosmos Hub), and work to produce a patch. We will then assist in rolling these patches out to validators to resolve the incident as soon as possible.

We will also advise core teams if we notice issues in upcoming releases which could cause safety or liveness problems, and assist them to resolve the issues.

We will write a monthly report on our activities so that the community has insight into them and can keep us accountable. Since the funding will be disbursed on a vesting basis, the amount can always be adjusted by governance, adding even more accountability to the arrangement.

Here are some incidents and potential incidents we helped resolve or prevent in the past:

We reported and helped fix an ICA issue affecting Quicksilver on the hub in the fall of 2022.
We reported Golang version mismatches that can cause apphash errors
We’ve worked on improving archive node sync speed and proper upgrade procedure
We reported and fixed Cosmos Hub and Cosmos-SDK CI Systems that reported as passed no matter what
We report, helped fix, and helped distribute fixes for CPU usage spikes that resulted in the discovery of a potential exploit in Comet / Tendermint P2P
https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.25

We cannot and will not disclose security items until they are fixed, so we will rely on teams like ICF, Informal, IG, Iqlusion, Strangelove and Binary Holdings to confirm for the community that we are actively working in that space.

We also continuously work to improve and develop the systems we work with, including Tendermint/Comet, Cosmos-SDK, IBC, and the Cosmos Hub. Members of the ICF and its TAB have recognized that our contributions to the stack from a technical perspective are substantial. Here are some examples of the development work we have been doing. We’ll keep making improvements like these as we find things to improve and as time allows:

https://nvlabs.notion.site/Interchain-Foundation-81c2e013f10a44e8a94701f5f97e9c7d



What we aren’t doing
We are not asking for product ownership of any of the above named repositories, the current product owners are excellent.
We are not implying that we will not seek funding for specific initiatives that go beyond the scope of maintenance.
We are not expressing to the community that we can find or solve every possible issue in security.

Recipient

We think it is essential for accountability and good governance that community pool funding recipients such as ourselves are given their funding in a vesting form for ongoing services. However, due to some technical limitations it is not possible to send funds directly from the community pool to a vesting account. For this reason, the funding will first go to prominent community members on a multisig who will then transfer it directly to a vesting account controlled by Notional.

Community members will create a 2/3 single use multisignature wallet to receive funding and share the address with the community. The funds will only be in this multisig for a few hours until the signers transfer them to our vesting account where they will be released over the term of our work.

The signers will be community members with the needed experience.  This is a single-use multisig account composed of community members.

CryptoCrew
Rarma
stakecito

multisig wallet - cosmos1u69e8tsq3h3q3alqrdv333hvzazdfn5aeq9svw

From there, the atoms will be transferred to a multisig continuous vesting account with signers from our team.

"Spacebox - Tool for chain Indexation and Storage in the Cosmos Hub

Forum [discussion](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-spacebox-tool-for-data-indexation-and-storage-in-the-cosmos-hub/9767)

Full proposal text in [IPFS](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmW4B1EWNbqCBmtE5s7F6KauV7y3HfW4haASgcbXocW4ny)

## Introduction

As the Cosmos ecosystem expands and evolves, the requirement for efficient and reliable data management solutions within the Cosmos Hub becomes increasingly essential. Bro_n_Bro have expertise in working with indexers in the ecosystem and comprehending their utilization in building advanced applications. Despite the popularity of existing indexers for monitoring purposes, they lack the necessary flexibility and user experience for developers and users. As more blockchains emerge, the need for more data storage becomes imperative. Although improving storage and data access at the SDK level would be ideal, for now, a separate indexer remains the best solution for quick access to data.

To address this requirement, we propose developing a comprehensive set of open-source tools for data indexation and storage, utilizing the cutting-edge technology of ClickHouse as the foundation for the storage facility. This approach will provide quick access to large data sets and ensure a stable architecture that guarantees data consistency and enables a lightweight setup. This will foster the creation of more sophisticated user experience and analytics applications within the Cosmos Hub and across the entire Cosmos ecosystem.

## Scope of Work

- Utilizing ClickHouse as the storage facility to provide quick access to large data sets
- Developing a stable architecture that guarantees data consistency
- An easily deployable setup that will enable the development of more user-experience and analytics applications in the Cosmos Hub and the entire Cosmos ecosystem
- Providing dev documentation, contribution, and setup guides to assist in the understanding and execution of the project

## Description

We formed the proposed architecture for the mean of scalability and data consistency.

To achieve named purposes process of crawling and writing to DB are separated into different microservices:

- [crawler](https://github.com/bro-n-bro/spacebox-crawler)
- [writer](https://github.com/bro-n-bro/spacebox-writer)

All services are packed into the docker to simplify deployment. The main [repo](https://github.com/bro-n-bro/spacebox) contains a ready-to-use docker-compose file and deployment documentation.

All the services mentioned above are in the pre-Alpha version and should not be considered a final product.

## Funding

Amount: 7500 ATOM

Recipient: cosmos106yp7zw35wftheyyv9f9pe69t8rteumjxjql7m

Development has been started already, but to finalize it, we are requesting the support of the Cosmos Hub community. 7500 ATOMs would be enough to cover the costs of development and implementation of the Indexer that supports current [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.45.13/x) and IBC modules

The proposed project will take:

**soft date** - 3 months

**hard date** - 6 months

## Conclusion

Today most cosmos applications are built either on raw chain data directly from API or based on closed-source indexators. Having open-sourced robust solution with easy and fast data access may drive great new applications development and improve whole ecosystem growth.

## Whoami

Bro_n_Bro has been presented in the Cosmos ecosystem for almost two years as an independent community-driven validator in 12 chains. The team behind it has been developing in Cosmos for nearly six years.

# V9 Lambda upgrade (with Replicated Security)

***Terminology note:** Interchain Security is the name for a family of protocols. The feature being discussed here is in this family, but more accurately termed “Replicated Security”. In the past it has been referred to as Interchain Security v1, or ICS, but going forward we refer to it as Replicated Security.*

## Summary
This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt . By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.  

The Cosmos Hub is upgrading its security system with a new feature called Replicated Security. This will allow the Cosmos Hub to provide its strong security to other blockchains, which are called 'consumer chains'. The cost to censor or control a consumer chain with an economic attack is the same as the cost to censor or control the Cosmos Hub itself. This means that consumer chains can benefit from the Cosmos Hub's security without having to maintain their own validator sets.  

Replicated Security works through the IBC protocol. Consumer chains receive periodic IBC packets containing the up-to-date validator set of the Cosmos Hub and use this to update their own validator sets, effectively replicating the Hub's validator set. This means that the Cosmos Hub's validators can validate multiple chains at once with the same stake.  

In exchange for this service, consumer chains are expected to send a portion of their fees and inflation to the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators. These tokens will then be included as part of the Cosmos Hub's staking rewards.

## Software details
### Updates
* (feat) Add [Interchain-Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v1.0.0) provider module. See the [ICS Spec](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation/README.md) for more details.
* (gaia) Bump [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.13-ics](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics) for details.
* (gaia) Bump [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to [v4.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v4.2.x/CHANGELOG.md). See [v4.2 Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for details.
* (gaia) Bump [tendermint](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to [0.34.26](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/tree/v0.34.26). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/blob/v0.34.26/CHANGELOG.md#v03426) for details.
* (gaia) Bump [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) to [v4.0.4](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v4.0.4).
* (tests) Add [E2E ccv tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/tests/e2e/e2e_gov_test.go#L138). Tests covering new functionality introduced by the provider module to add and remove a consumer chain via governance proposal.
* (tests) Add [integration ccv tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/tests/ics/interchain_security_test.go). Imports Interchain-Security's  and implements Gaia as the provider chain.

### On-Chain Upgrade Process
When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary.  

Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local).

### Potential Risk Factors
Although very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.  

Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the #validators-verified channel of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v8.0.1).

## Governance votes
The following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:

* YES - You approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.
* NO - You don’t approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub. Please indicate why on the Cosmos Hub forum.
* NO WITH VETO - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.
* ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

## Appendix: Replicated Security
### Changes to this proposal
This proposal went onto the governance forum in mid-December. Since that time, we have made one change to the protocol. In response to the only high-severity finding in the Informal audit report (see 'Testing and audits below'), and feedback from the community, we have made it so that the slashing and tombstoning of validators for offenses on consumer chains must be approved by a governance vote. This will have a [very minimal impact](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing) on the operation and security of consumer chains while protecting the Cosmos Hub from possibility of an attack by a rogue consumer chain.  

This governance gating is temporary until the Cosmos Hub is able to cryptographically verify proof of double signing in an upcoming release of Replicated Security. This does not give governance the ability to slash validators arbitrarily, but rather to approve slash packets that have already been transmitted from a consumer chain.

### The ATOM economic zone
It is anticipated that consumer chains using Replicated Security will collaborate closely in an 'ATOM economic zone'. This is expected to have a snowball effect, with the Cosmos Hub securing a growing group of high-value decentralized protocols. Already, some prominent projects such as a smart-contracting platform, an AMM, several liquid staking providers and others have expressed interest in using Replicated Security from the Cosmos Hub.  

Replicated Security can also be used to further the cause of “Hub minimalism”. Any new features to the Hub, even if they are core to the Hub's functionality, can be launched as consumer chains. This allows the Hub to scale better and separate release cycles, enabling faster deployment of new features.

### Onboarding a consumer chain
This governance proposal will not launch any consumer chains on its own. Instead, it will only add the necessary code to the Cosmos Hub to enable Replicated Security. In order to launch, each consumer chain must submit their own governance proposal to be voted on separately.  

It is expected that before launch, a consumer chain will have participated in a Cosmos Hub Replicated Security testnet, conducted their own testnets, and undergone an audit by reputable auditors.  

Once a consumer chain proposal passes, Cosmos Hub validators can begin running the consumer chain and receiving rewards. The chain will only start if more than two-thirds (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators decide to run the consumer chain.

### Offboarding a consumer chain
Once the consumer chain is running, validators can be slashed and jailed for consensus faults such as downtime and double signing on the consumer chain.  

At any point in time, one-third (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators will be able to stop running the consumer chain at once: the chain will halt, and none of them will be slashed for downtime.  

The offboardings of consumer chains will have strong social norms to protect both sides, and any kind of forceful exit will only be coordinated in extreme cases such as protocol failures or attacks.  

For normal cases, a separate governance proposal will be made to remove a consumer chain, which will allow Cosmos Hub validators to stop running it.

"Interchain Info Funding

# Overview

[Original Cosmos Forum Post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-21-interchain-info-hub-funding/9822)
[IPFS Version](https://sparkibc.s3.filebase.com/InterchainInfo/Hub%20Funding%20Prop%20for%20ICI.pdf)

Built by Spark IBC, Interchain Info (ICI) is a truly multi-chain & chain-agnostic hub for information and tooling to make navigating the rapidly growing Interchain easier for both new and old users alike. At Spark IBC, we believe that, currently, “Cosmos” and the greater Interchain are extremely fragmented, as communities, educational resources, NFT collections, Dapps and tools each reside in their own remote corners of the ecosystem.

ICI aims to change this by taking the first step toward building the unified, multi-chain future that the community has been waiting for, and that we believe is paramount to Cosmos gaining mass adoption in the next market cycle. We are currently running an ICI funding campaign on the Spark IBC platform, found here, [https://sparkibc.zone](https://sparkibc.zone) 4 along with more details about ICI itself.

We are avoiding VCs and private investors in this endeavor, because ICI is only a valuable resource if it remains unbiased and beholden to no one but the community that uses it. Therefore, all ICI costs so far have come out of our own pockets, and going forwards, we're raising funds entirely through grants and donations from users and community pools.

## Request

We request 1% of community pool funds, capped at $20,000 from a number of chains, including The Cosmos Hub, to contribute to The ICI Campaign on Spark IBC. For The Hub, this makes our total ask ~$20k or 1,438 ATOM at the time of writing.

If passed,

- 50% of issued funds will be donated directly to ICI for general development, hosting and maintenance, to be used alongside other funding sources like private contributions done through the Spark platform.
- The remaining 50% will be used as incentives for community members to create and submit content about general cosmos tech. For other chains, this 50% is reserved for content about stuff built in that chains ecosystem, but since the Hub is positioned a bit differently, we think it's match made in heaven to direct these funds towards content on things like IBC, CosmWasm, the Cosmos SDK, etc.
- For The Hub, this amounts to ~20k USD in Atom total, which is about 1,438 ATOM, which will then be split 50/50 as outlined above.

Each network that approves funding will be rewarded with Spark Points based on their full donation amount and a customized entry on our leaderboard labeled “[chain name] Community.” Spark Points are used within the Spark IBC system to recognize users for their contributions to the Interchain. In this case, there would be an entry made for “The Cosmos Hub Community” with 20k Spark Points.

One Spark Point is representative of one dollar (or USDC, or, in this case, token equivalent) donated, and is tracked through the soulbound $SPARK token on Juno Network. For these donations, Spark IBC will set up a wallet on Juno, or use the Bech32 converted version of the community pools address on Juno, label it accordingly on our leaderboard, and mint $SPARK equivalent to the USD value of the donated amount into it, measured by the price at the time of distribution. Slippage and fees for conversion will not be taken into account, as that's beyond the communities control.

One significant benefit of multi-chain projects is the unique ability to distribute our funding requests across different sources to minimize sell pressure and the burden on any single community pool/token. This sort of effort is something that Spark IBC plans to pioneer and offer as a potential service to any who use the Spark IBC platform for fundraising in future.


Similar funding requests will also be submitted to the following Cosmos chains:

- Agoric
- Akash
- Band
- Carbon
- Cheqd
- Chihuahua
- Comdex
- Cosmos Hub
- Evmos
- Fetch AI
- Injective
- Juno
- Kava
- Kujira

- Persistence
- Secret
- Sommelier
- Stargaze

## Spending Details

### Base Contribution

In addition to the ICI info on SparkIBC.zone, we also have a rough breakdown of how funds will be spent given hitting certain funding tiers, found here 2
Link: [ICI Budget Outline for Initial Raise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GYFnJYozptojj3ytE_OYbo03inoQ1dEJxnHnmparWQ/edit#gid=0)

### Incentives Program

As stated, 50% of the requested $20k will be used exclusively to incentivize content related to general Cosmos tech & terminology on the Index and Resource hub. This allows community members and content creators the ability to earn a little income while contributing something beneficial to the entire interchain. It also ensures that a portion of the allotted funding amount returns to the community in a very direct way.

Note: the Spark & ICI Team reserve the right to deny payment, both pre/post-production, to anyone on the basis of content quality or attempts to manipulate this proposed system (i.e. needlessly long articles, videos, copy others existing work as a full new submission etc.); this is not a “trustless” incentive program. At this time, we will only accept English submissions meeting basic literary standards; however, we may expand this program to include other languages in the future and/or add a translation tier to the list of incentives below (we are open to feedback on these details):

[Submission outline](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/9/92c9a4e08b05afbc1cf46e0da69df8b0c827f1ee_2_450x500.png)

*$0.05/word (written content) and $5.00/min. (video content) are below industry standards, but the crux of this project is to further incentivize creators who are already producing original content, while refining and updating existing material that needs to constantly be updated. In its entirety, this project will both promote new material and provide house-keeping for fresh, up-to-date information in order to attract new ecosystem investors and users.

## Misc. Details

How will payment be distributed and handled?

- We will be asking for the requested amount as a single lump sum payment. The amount granted will then be split into two chunks, each comprising 50% of the total.
	- 50% will be DCA'd out into stables over the following 15 days. Meaning a maximum daily sell pressure of no more than ~$666 per day for chains granting the full 20k, such as the Hub, and far less for others. This will be the base contribution.
	- The other 50% will be set aside for the content incentives program outlined above, and we will be gauging community sentiment on doing one of the three following options
		- Keep in the native currency
		- DCA out to stables along with the rest. Sell pressure will be kept to the above figure or less.
		- DCA out half (of the 50%, or 25% of the total) along with the base contribution.

Will the incentives program be transparent?
	- Of course! We will keep records of payouts and the work done to receive them for the community to review. This also serves to provide a metric for results, and should help communities gauge whether a continuation of this program later down the road would be something of interest to them or not.

How long do you intend the incentive programs to last?
	- Due to the drastically different ask amounts amongst various chains, as well as the amount of content relevant to them, some chains' incentives may dry up much quicker than others. We believe that with the program we've outlined above, regardless of the duration, the general amount of work achieved per dollar spent should be similar.

What happens if a chain does not pass the proposal, are they to be treated any differently?
	- Absolutely not. All chains and projects in the Cosmos are equal in our eyes, and no community will be penalized for failing to support our effort, except by missing out on the incentives program and, of course, contributing to something crucially important for the entire Interchain.

"Replicated Security Third Party Audit

# Replicated Secuirty Third Party Audit

Authors: [Simply Staking](https://twitter.com/SimplyStaking)

## Summary

Commissioning [Oak Security](https://www.oaksecurity.io/) to conduct a third-party audit of the Replicated Security (Interchain Security v1) code with a similar scope as to the audit conducted by the Informal audit team.

## The Proposal

This proposal aims to use community pool funds to commission a third-party audit for the Replicated Security code. This audit is to be conducted by Oak Security, one of the most-reputable auditors in the space.

The price of the audit will be $102,000 and will take roughly three weeks starting on the 29th of March 2023. The auditors will require payment upfront to start the audit process after which, contact will be kept with each other for progress updates and any questions during the audit.

The scope of the audit is to review the latest version of the Replicated Security code. The main aims are to double-check the audit by Informal Systems as well as review the code changes since that audit was completed to ensure that the latest version of the Replicated Security code is reviewed thoroughly and no new issues have come to light.

Since this is a community pool spend proposal, we want to ensure the community that the funds will arrive at the designated recipient by creating a multi-sig.

The multi-sig will comprise of:

-   [Jehan](https://twitter.com/JTremback) (Informal Systems)
-   [Zaki](https://twitter.com/zmanian) (Core Cosmos Contributor)
-   [Jacob](https://twitter.com/gadikian) (Notional)
-   [Kai](https://twitter.com/oldremez) (Neutron)

The address of the Multi-Sig: [cosmos1j20yq6atn9nuanwgsancnv4wk4nszagk3wwudp](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/account/cosmos1j20yq6atn9nuanwgsancnv4wk4nszagk3wwudp)

## Breakdown of Fees

With this proposal, we (Simply Staking) have been and will be the main point of contact with Oak Security which means that we will handle all things related to answering their questions and queries. Even though we are not a direct part of the multi-sig, we are the coordinators for the multi-sig. For the work with Oak Security and the multi-sig coordination, we seek a compensation fee of around 15% of the total ask.

From that 15% that will be given to us for our work, a small fee would be distributed to the multi-sig members as a form of compensation. The members are being paid due to requiring them to confirm that the audit was completed as described, prior to distributing of funds.

All payments are to be sent out to the recipients once the whole audit process is complete.

## Funding

OAK Quote: $102,000 + 15% price buffer to account for volatility of the ATOM token during voting period : $117,300

Simply Staking + Multi-Sig Fees: $15,300

**Total ask 11,050 ATOM @ $12 per ATOM ~ $132,600**

**All leftover funds will be sent back to the community pool**.

"Make Cosmos Hub the Sponsor of Game of NFTs Phase 2 Hackathon

## Make Cosmos Hub the Sponsor of Game of NFTs Phase 2 Hackathon

This proposal is requesting approval to allocate 4,500 ATOM (~$50,000) from the Community Pool to make Cosmos Hub the sponsor of the Game of NFTs (GoN) Phase 2 Hackathon and cover the prizes for Interchain Challenge winners.

*Benefits to the Hub*

As a primary sponsor of the GoN Phase 2 Hackathon, the Cosmos Hub will be able to define a dedicated challenge, discover projects, select and reward winners.

For the Hub's track, it would be exciting to see something built that combines Interchain NFTs with Interchain Security and maximizes the capability of IBC. Some rough ideas are as follows:

* Build NFT consumer chains
* Build NFT dApps on a consumer chain
* Build Interchain NFT use cases across consumer chains

We are hopeful that the hundreds of participants, the creativity and talent of the community, and the lucrative rewards for winners will result in opportunities that help grow Phase 2 submissions into viable products that add value to the ATOM economic zone.

If governance approves this sponsorship, the Cosmos Hub core team will support the hackathon by assisting with the formation of the challenge, and providing a judge and developer support (in relation to using Replicated Security).

*Reward Details*

The prize pool of Cosmos Hub challenge will be:

* 1st Place: 2,750 ATOM
* 2nd Place: 1,250 ATOM
* 3rd Place: 500 ATOM

If this proposal passes, there will be a Cosmos Hub judge team which will award prizes in accordance with criteria outlined in the challenge. Any surplus will be returned to the community pool.

Multisig Committee is:

* Haifeng Xi | Co-founder, Bianjie
* Dayakar Reddy | Founder, OmniFlix Network
* Jeffrey Hu | Tech Lead, HashKey Capital

"Liquid staking module: Regulated and efficient liquid staking

#Summary
This is a signaling proposal to replace the Cosmos Hub staking, distribution, and slashing modules with variants that regulate liquid staking. We call these variants collectively the “liquid staking module” (LSM). The LSM mitigates liquid staking risks by limiting the total amount of ATOM that can be liquid staked to 25% of all staked ATOM. The initial GlobalLiquidStakingCap would be set to 25% and is configurable by Cosmos Hub governance. As an additional risk-mitigation feature, the LSM introduces a requirement that validators self-bond 1 ATOM to be eligible for 250 ATOM in delegations from liquid staking providers or to be eligible to mint LSM tokens. This new mechanism is called the “validator bond,” and is technically distinct from the current self-bond mechanism, but functions similarly; the initial validator bond factor would be set at 250 and is configurable by Cosmos Hub governance. At the same time, the LSM introduces the ability for staked ATOM to be instantly liquid staked, without having to wait for the twenty-one day unbonding period. In sum, the liquid staking module equips the Cosmos Hub to thrive in a world with increasing demand for liquid staked ATOM. It proposes a safe, regulated path toward increasing capital efficiency. 


# Next steps
This proposal is a temperature check with the Cosmos Hub community. It is NOT executable. No onchain actions will be triggered if the proposal passes. Before any onchain actions are executed, a separate software upgrade proposal would need to be posted onchain and be voted in by governance. If this proposal passes, it will signal to the Gaia team to integrate these changes into a near term future upgrade. Our goal would be to include LSM in a Cosmos Hub upgrade proposal within the next six months.

"Request to Drop the Lawsuit: All in Bits, Inc. vs. Grace Yu

## Signalling Proposal for All in Bits, Inc. to Withdraw Legal Action Against Grace Yu

### Introduction:
Our community, consisting of developers, contributors, validators, creators, and $ATOM holders, encompasses a diverse range of backgrounds and opinions. However, there is a prevailing sentiment of unity surrounding the ongoing legal dispute between All in Bits, Inc., and Grace Yu. We are collectively advocating for All in Bits, Inc. to withdraw their lawsuit against Grace Yu, as it threatens not only the reputation of our network but also the values that underpin the Cosmos vision.

### Context and Background:
All in Bits, Inc., a foundation organisation of $ATOM, has initiated a lawsuit against Grace Yu, a member of our community, on grounds that many believe to be unsubstantiated. The case was taken to a Federal court, seeking damages of $150,000. The legal costs incurred just to initiate the case substantially exceed this value. The concern is that this legal action seems motivated by vindictive intent rather than legitimate legal grievances, which has led to widespread confusion and increasing distrust.

### Legal Implications and Community Impact:
The lawsuit against Grace Yu has the potential to instigate unwarranted scrutiny and may have legal implications for $ATOM. The impact of this legal action on the token's value, precedent,, and overall community sentiment should be carefully considered. Moreover, the community's perception of All in Bits, Inc., may suffer, which could weaken our collective trust in the Cosmos network.

### Misuse of Funds and Core Values:
We find it particularly concerning that All in Bits, Inc., has chosen to allocate funds, initially intended for the development and promotion of open-source software, towards financing this lawsuit. This decision contradicts the principles of transparency and fairness that are fundamental to our community.

### Request:
We disapprove of legal action against any community member from founding organisations. Respectfully, for the benefit of the ecosystem, we ask that All in Bits, Inc. drop its lawsuit against Grace Yu, immediately.

"Stride to join ATOM Economic Zone and adopt ICS

This is a signaling proposal for the Stride blockchain to join the ATOM Economic Zone and adopt interchain security (ICS) from Cosmos Hub. This signaling proposal is only to achieve social consensus, and will not directly make any changes to Cosmos Hub.

If passed, two concurrent follow-up proposals would be required to implement this signaling proposal, namely 1) an interchain security prop to onboard the Stride blockchain, and 2) a community spend prop to send 450K ATOM to the ATOM Accelerator DAO multisig.

Under this proposal, Stride would share its various revenues with Cosmos Hub as follows:

-15% of liquid staking rewards

-15% of STRD inflationary staking rewards

-15% of maximal extractible value (MEV) revenue

-15% of transaction fees

In return, Cosmos Hub would share its economic security with Stride. Also, since Stride would be part of the ATOM Economic Zone, Cosmos Hub would share 450,000 ATOM, to be provided to an stATOM/ATOM liquidity pool on Astroport’s Neutron deployment. These funds would be used to facilitate trading between stATOM and ATOM, would not be spent in any way, would remain the property of Cosmos Hub, and would always remain under the control of Cosmos Hub.

The Stride blockchain has already voted yes to this proposal. Now it’s time for Cosmos Hub to decide if it wants to accept Stride’s application to join the AEZ and adopt ICS.

**Governance votes**

The following items describe the voting options and their significance for this proposal:

-**YES**: You agree with all the terms of this proposal, the main terms being: 1) Cosmos Hub shares its economic security with Stride, 2) Cosmos Hub shares 450K of ATOM liquidity, and 3) Stride shares 15% of all its revenues with Cosmos Hub

-**NO**: You do not agree with all the terms of this proposal. You may agree with some terms and disagree with others. But if you do not agree with all terms, vote NO

-**NO WITH VETO**: You 1) consider this proposal to be spam, 2) believe it infringes on minority interests, or 3) believe it violates the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned

"Increase the validator set of Cosmos Hub to 180 from 175

#### Problem

Currently, the validator set size in the Cosmos Hub is 175, and the last validator has 113K Atom delegated to them (at the time of writing), which translates into 1.2 million USD worth of Atom. This higher requirement barred many Cosmos community validators from validation on the Hub.
It is extra difficult to get into the active set with this barrier even if a validator receives delegations or tokens for their contribution (such as ICF delegations or Game of Chains/Game of NFT projects) or if they are bringing value into ecosystem in any other way.

#### Proposed solution
Increasing the validator set to 180 from 175 can solve this problem.

Originally, the Cosmos whitepaper stated that the validator set size should increase 13% yearly until it hits 300 validators as a cap. In July 2019, proposal #10 suggested a new way to set the validator set size: through governance.

The decision of increasing the validator set just by 5 spots, as opposed to past proposals, was done to ensure increasing validator set would be safe. If this proposal passes, the community can later decide whether the Hub wants to allow more validators to join after analysing how this proposal affected the validator set, and submit another validator set expansion proposal, if needed.

#### Governance votes

The following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:

YES - You approve this increase in the validator set to 200 from 175.
NO - You disapprove of this increase in the validator set to 200 from 175.

NO WITH VETO - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

# v10 Software Upgrade\r
\r
## Summary\r
\r
This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt Gaia v10.0.0. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.\r
\r
The forum post discussing this upgrade can be found [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-gaia-v10-upgrade/10746).\r
\r
#### Background\r
Since the last v9-Lambda upgrade at height 14470501 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to Gaia.\r
\r
**Updates**\r
- Meta Issue [#2498](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/2498) Bump multiple dependencies:\r
    - Bump [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.16-ics](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.16-ics). See the v0.45.16 release notes for details.\r
    - Bump [IBC GO](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to [v4.4.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v4.4.0).\r
    - Bump [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) to [v0.34.28](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.34.28).\r
    - Bump [Golang prerequisite from 1.18 to 1.20](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/2499). See (https://go.dev/blog/go1.20) for details.\r
\r
\r
\r
#### Testnet\r
V10 went live on the persistent testnet after the successful simulated upgrade. For more information, see the testnet [upgrade proposal](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/proposals/167) or [block explorer](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/), and visit the [persistent testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public).\r
\r
#### On-Chain Upgrade Process\r
\r
This upgrade can be performed in multiple ways. When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically *before* swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found&nbsp;[here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the&nbsp;[local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\r
\r
#### Potential Risk Factors\r
\r
Although very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the&nbsp; channel&nbsp;of the&nbsp;[Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork)&nbsp;to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v9.1.1).",0.0012123945203407944

"Provide 450K ATOM to Stride’s stATOM liquidity pool

# Provide 450K ATOM to Stride’s stATOM liquidity pool

## Summary

Stride’s ICS signaling proposal, passed by Cosmos Hub governance on May 11th, established social consensus around the terms of Stride’s admission into the ATOM Economic Zone and adoption of interchain security. But no actual changes have yet been implemented. In order to implement Stride’s ICS signaling proposal, two concurrent executable proposals are needed.

This is the second of two executable proposals. This proposal is to provide 450,000 ATOM from the community pool to the stATOM/ATOM liquidity pool on Astroport Neutron.

This liquidity will benefit Stride and Neutron, both members of the ATOM Economic Zone. For Stride, more stATOM liquidity further strengthens the stATOM-ATOM peg, which will enable increased stATOM collateralization. For Neutron, stATOM liquidity will generate transaction fees and MEV revenue. The success of Stride and Neutron is the success of Cosmos Hub, since both share their block rewards with Cosmos Hub.



## Details


According to the agreed upon terms in Stride’s ICS proposal, this 450K ATOM will be stewarded by the ATOM Accelerator DAO. Established by Cosmos Hub prop 95, the ATOM Accelerator is comprised of several known, respected, and trusted members of the Cosmos Hub community.

Upon receipt of the 450K ATOM, the members of the ATOM Accelerator will use it to establish an stATOM/ATOM liquidity position on Astroport Neutron. After the liquidity position has been established, the ATOM Accelerator won’t touch the liquidity unless instructed to via a Cosmos Hub signaling proposal.

The ATOM Accelerator’s stewardship of this liquidity is temporary. If an alternative arrangement to steward this liquidity is not established by Cosmos Hub governance before October 1st, 2023, then on that date the ATOM Accelerator will begin the process of returning the full 450K ATOM to the community pool.


### Governance votes
The following items describe the voting options and their significance for this proposal:
- **YES**: You wish to implement the provision of 450K ATOM to an stATOM/ATOM pool on Astroport Neutron, as previously agreed upon in Stride’s ICS signaling prop
- **NO**: You do not wish to implement the liquidity provisioning agreement
- **NO WITH VETO**: You 1) consider this proposal to be spam, 2) believe it infringes on minority interests, or 3) believe it violates the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned

"Signalling Proposal - Gravity Dex Liquidity Module Removal

# Signalling Proposal - Gravity Dex Liquidity Module Removal 

## Summary
This signaling proposal has been drafted to solicit community approval for the removal of the Gravity Dex liquidity module from the CosmosHub and to return the funds contained therein to the rightful owners.

It is important to remove the liquidity module because it will increase development speed and efficiency while greatly reducing overhead. Additionally, alternative modules that serve a similar functionality and will be actively maintained are being developed.

## Context
The liquidity module was introduced in proposal [#51](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/51), but has been migrated to the Crescent chain after proposal [#62](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/62) 1. Currently only pool withdrawals are enabled, with module swaps and deposits blocked with proposal [#67](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/67). Despite withdrawals being enabled for over a year, the liquidity pools still contain unclaimed funds that need to be redistributed.

### The Importance of Removing the Module
The module is not actively maintained and has no utility on the Hub. A failure to remove it will drastically decrease the speed at which the Cosmos Hub can be upgraded, and result in increased overhead to perform such upgrades.

Due to its lack of utility and the costs of keeping it on the Hub, the module should be removed and the funds held therein should be returned to their owners.

## Removal Details
Currently, the Liquidity module contains around ~$150,000 worth of un-withdrawn tokens. The developers of the Liquidity module have kindly prepared code to facilitate the removal of this module and get any remaining funds back to their rightful owners. Here is how this will happen:

During the next planned Hub upgrade, a migration script will run which will return ~99% of the unwithdrawn tokens directly back to their owners.
~1% of tokens (worth ~$1000) will remain which cannot be attributed to an owner.
This remaining ~1% will be transferred to the community pool. If in the future, the rightful owners come forward with evidence of their ownership, these tokens can be returned to them by governance proposal.

## Proposal Outcomes
The following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:

Upon a YES vote:

- Development will continue on the removal of the Gravity DEX liquidity module and upon completion will be integrated into Gaia and rolled out in the next major release
- Upon a Gaia rollout with this feature, all remaining funds will be sent back to originating accounts. Funds that are not owned by anyone (accrued tx fess, or other protocol-owned funds) will be sent to the community pool.
- In a subsequent Gaia release, the module will removed completely

Upon a NO vote:

- Development will be on-hold and discussions with the community will continue to find the best path forward to remove the liquidity module and address the funds contained therein.

- NO WITH VETO - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned

"Takeoff Proposal from Cyber to Cosmos

cyber Congress (https://cybercongress.ai) developed Cyber (https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber): a software for replacing existing internet behemoth monopolies, such as Google, which exploited outdated internet protocols using the common patterns of our semantic interaction. These corps lock the information, produced by the users, from search, social and commercial knowledge graphs in private databases, and then sell this knowledge back as advertisement. They stand as an insurmountable wall between content creators and consumers extracting an overwhelming majority of the created value.

We propose ATOM holders to invest 10,000 ATOM from the community pool into the Takeoff of Cyber. In exchange, at the end of its donation round (https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff), and when an IBC connection will become possible, cyber Congress will transfer CYB tokens back to the community pool. Passing this proposal will transfer 10,000 ATOMs from the community pool to cyber Congress multisig (https://www.mintscan.io/account/cosmos1latzme6xf6s8tsrymuu6laf2ks2humqv2tkd9a).

Full Proposal-Manifest text: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUYDQt9tqLQJwxnUck7dQY3XmZA3tDtpFh3Hchkg7oH46

or at https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff

The software we offer resembles a decentralized google (https://github.com/cybercongress):
- A protocol spec and the rationale behind it
- go-cyber: our implementation using cosmos-sdk
- cyber.page: PoC reference web interface
- launch-kit: useful tools for launching cosmos-sdk based chains
- cyberindex: GraphQL middleware for cyber
- euler Foundation: mainnet predecessor of cyber Foundation: the DAO, which will handle all the donated ETH
- documentation and various side tools

Cyber solves the problem of opening up the centralised semantics core of the Internet. It does so by opening up access to evergrowing semantics core taught to it by the users.

Economics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.

You already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.

With the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.

Cosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.

A good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (с) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).

The solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.

This means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.

If this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will open another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in Game of Links (https://cyber.page/gol/) or Takeoff https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff independently. If you have question you can ask them either on Cyber topic on Cosmos forum (https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cyber-a-decentralized-google-for-provable-and-relevant-answers) or Cyber forum (https://ai.cybercongress.ai).

"ATOM 🤝 Osmosis:  Allocate Community Pool to ATOM Liquidity Incentives

ATOMs should be the base money of Cosmos, just like ETH is the base money of the entire Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. ATOM is currently well positioned to play this role among Cosmos assets because it has the highest market cap, most liquidity, largest brand, and many integrations with fiat onramps. ATOM is the gateway to Cosmos.

In the Cosmos Hub Port City vision, ATOMs are pitched as equity in the Cosmos Hub.  However, this alone is insufficient to establish ATOM as the base currency of the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Instead, the ATOM community must work to actively promote the use of ATOMs throughout the Cosmos ecosystem, rather than passively relying on the Hub's reputation to create ATOM's value.

In order to cement the role of ATOMs in Cosmos DeFi, the Cosmos Hub should leverage its community pool to help align incentives with other protocols within the Cosmos ecosystem. We propose beginning this initiative by using the community pool ATOMs to incentivize deep ATOM base pair liquidity pools on the Osmosis Network.

Osmosis is the first IBC-enabled DeFi application. Within its 3 weeks of existence, it has already 100x’d the number of IBC transactions ever created, demonstrating the power of IBC and the ability of the Cosmos SDK to bootstrap DeFi protocols with $100M+ TVL in a short period of time. Since its announcement Osmosis has helped bring renewed attention and interest to Cosmos from the crypto community at large and kickstarted the era of Cosmos DeFi.

Osmosis has already helped in establishing ATOM as the Schelling Point of the Cosmos ecosystem.  The genesis distribution of OSMO was primarily based on an airdrop to ATOM holders specifically, acknowledging the importance of ATOM to all future projects within the Cosmos. Furthermore, the Osmosis LP rewards currently incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs of the platform.

Osmosis has the ability to incentivize AMM liquidity, a feature not available on any other IBC-enabled DEX. Osmosis already uses its own native OSMO liquidity rewards to incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs, leading to ~2.2 million ATOMs already providing liquidity on the platform.

In addition to these native OSMO LP Rewards, the platform also includes a feature called “external incentives” that allows anyone to permissionlessly add additional incentives in any token to the LPs of any AMM pools they wish. You can read more about this mechanism here: https://medium.com/osmosis/osmosis-liquidity-mining-101-2fa58d0e9d4d#f413 . Pools containing Cosmos assets such as AKT and XPRT are already planned to receive incentives from their respective community pools and/or foundations.

We propose the Cosmos Hub dedicate 100,000 ATOMs from its Community Pool to be allocated towards liquidity incentives on Osmosis over the next 3 months. This community fund proposal will transfer 100,000 ATOMs to a multisig group who will then allocate the ATOMs to bonded liquidity gauges on Osmosis on a biweekly basis, according to direction given by Cosmos Hub governance.  For simplicity, we propose setting the liquidity incentives to initially point to Osmosis Pool #1, the ATOM/OSMO pool, which is the pool with by far the highest TVL and Volume. Cosmos Hub governance can then use Text Proposals to further direct the multisig members to reallocate incentives to new pools.

The multisig will consist of a 2/3 key holder set consisting of the following individuals whom have all agreed to participate in this process shall this proposal pass:

- Zaki Manian
- Federico Kunze
- Marko Baricevic

This is one small step for the Hub, but one giant leap for ATOM-aligned.

"Lowering Liquidity Pool Creation Fee

Although the Gravity DEX launch on Cosmos Hub is technically successful, there exists several necessary ingredient to achieve significant user-base growth.

It includes of course, “farming incentives” for liquidity providers, but also the high pool creation fee disturbs quick adoption of pools with new tokens. The pool creation fee was introduced to prevent possible spamming attack to create tons of meaningless pools which will cause performance burden on Cosmos Hub.

Currently the fee(`PoolCreationFee`) is 40 Atoms, which is almost $1,600 as now. It was suggested when the Atom price is under $10, but now we have more reasons to make it significantly lower so that we can promote quicker new token introduction to the Gravity DEX.

Therefore we suggest 5 Atoms for pool creation fee, which is equivalent to about $200. We think that it is still very conservative amount for spamming prevention. Also we can suggest to adjust the fee amount again when it is necessary.",0.01683818921872841
"Use EVM (instead of EVMOS) as the symbol for Evmos' native coin

I propose changing the Evmos coin's symbol from EVMOS to EVM because it is shorter and more memorable.

Correspondingly, the coin's basic unit used in source codes is to be renamed to `uevm`.

"Include CosmWasm in Rho Upgrade

# Include CosmWasm in Rho Upgrade

## Summary

Signaling proposal to include CosmWasm on the Cosmos Hub in v8-Rho upgrade targeting Q2 2022. Further details and discussion at [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243).

## Details

This is a signaling proposal to include CosmWasm in the v8-Rho upgrade. The Cosmos Hub team at Interchain GmbH has done technical feasibility research by speaking with CosmWasm core contributors and validators to understand the burden of integration and believe it is technically feasible with resources in Interchain GmbH and Lido as well as regular advice meetings from Confio.

The instance of CosmWasm included on the Cosmos Hub will be governance gated and use Cosmos SDK v0.46.x. The governance feature set created by Confio, funded by [Prop 25](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/25), works so that all of the wasmd Message types can be executed by the chain’s governance module. These messages all otherwise have configurations so that they can be executed by one account, any account, or no accounts. Each message type should be set to “no account” so that it is only possible to execute messages with Governance. One alternative possibility that needs further review is whether to allow “one account” and designate it as the new governance module account to take advantage of the new features in the governance module coming in v8-Rho.

CosmWasm on the hub comes with benefits and drawbacks that deserve serious attention. A summary and background of the topic has been posted to [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243) where further discussion is taking place. Please visit and take these into consideration when voting.

"## Require a minimum 5% commission for all validator nodes

## Require a minimum 5% commission for all validator nodes.

### Reasoning: Competition drives innovation. Innovation drives sustainability and token value.
We should build a community where validators truly innovate and create value for delegators, rather than relying on their 0% commission to attract delegators. Allowing unsustainably low commission rates promotes spam and will not motivate validators to create innovative solutions for delegators, potentially stagnating the development of the Cosmos Network. 

Having a 5% minimum commission ensures that validators are incentivized to innovate to acquire delegators. This will also encourage greater decentralization on the Cosmos Network as validators compete for delegators based on merit (rather than 0% commissions). Additionally, it is necessary to provide proper incentives to validators for their work running and securing the Cosmos Network, especially during crypto winters. 

If this proposal is approved, the Cosmos Network would be updated so that:
1.  Existing validator nodes with commission rates set to less than 5% will have their commission automatically updated to 5%
2.  New validator nodes will have a floor commission rate of 5% 

### Vote: 
Yes – If you want to add a 5% minimum commission to encourage validators to innovate and add value for delegators, promote decentralization, and adequately compensate validators for their role in securing the network
No - If you want to leave Cosmos without a minimum commission amount",0.46350947174427765
"Letter from many Cosmos maximalists to the hub

The ATOM 2.0 White Paper has been released, the goal of the writers is to try to shift the Cosmos Hub in a new direction, while enriching themselves and setting up limited checks and balances for stakeholders, who have taken all the risk since the inception of the network.
Given the extreme nature of the changes proposed, we decided to use the proposal system for better visibility, we think its fair given the circumstances.


The letter attached to this proposal should clarify our position on it, we think in its current state the ATOM 2.0 upgrade would be extremely damaging to the hub.

"Atom Zero Constitution

This is a proposal to adopt a minimal constitution defined here.

# Atom Zero Constitution

## Definitions

 * two thirds supermajority: where more than 2/3rd of all staked ATOM voters
   vote YES and the participation rate is above the current governance quorum
   minimum limit, as of when the voting period has concluded. ABSTAIN votes
   count as NO votes for the purpose of supermajority calculation.

## Article Zero

Proposals with the following elements require a two thirds supermajority to pass:

 * any changes to tokenomics beyond what is already implemented (besides bug fixes).
 * any inflation of tokens beyond the default inflation of ATOMs.
 * any changes to the governance process.
 * any adoption of a constitution (except this minimal constitution).

Until the governance mechanism is changed to reflect this constitution, a
proposal that requires a two thirds majority as defined above but does not pass
with a two thirds supermajority will be deemed to have failed, even if they
pass with a simple majority according to existing logic.

If this proposal passes with a simple majority, the proposals that are
concurrent with this proposal (especially the ATOM ONE and ATOM2.0 proposals)
shall require a two thirds supermajority to be deemed to have passed.

"ATOM 2.0: A new vision for Cosmos Hub

## Summary
We propose a new Cosmos Hub vision document, a counterpart to the 2017 paper which focused primarily on the network of IBC-connected chains. With the creation of the Cosmos Stack (Tendermint, IBC, and SDK) and the development of key technologies for secure economic scaling (Interchain Security and Liquid Staking), the original vision of the Hub has been fulfilled. This document marks the transition to the next phase of the Cosmos Hub as an infrastructure service platform, and a renewed role for ATOM as preferred collateral within the Cosmos Network. It describes two pieces of app-specific functionality, the Interchain Scheduler and Interchain Allocator, which together form a flywheel for accelerating interchain growth. The Interchain Scheduler is a cross-chain block space marketplace, which generates revenues from cross-chain MEV. These revenues are used by the Interchain Allocator to capitalize new Cosmos chains, foster interchain collaboration, and thereby expand the total addressable market of the Scheduler. This paper also describes a new issuance regime optimized for Liquid Staking, where after a 36 month transition period, exponential issuance is reduced to a constant amount of ATOM issued per month. To administer the proposed plan, the paper describes the formation of Cosmos Councils, domain-specialized entities that carry out development and operations. Cosmos Councils together form the Cosmos Assembly, a body that is accountable to ATOM holders, responsible for setting yearly goals, resourcing, and administering work undertaken on behalf of Cosmos Hub.

We have included the paper below in its entirety for the community’s consideration.

This is a sentiment proposal for the finalization and future ratification of the [Atom One Constitution](https://github.com/tendermint/atom_one).

The Atom One Constitution completes the original vision for the Cosmos Hub,
and defines a clear economic model with ICS1/2A/2B interchain staking to enable thousands of new zones to bloom.
It provides checks and balances much needed by the Cosmos Hub to stay conservative and secure.

If this proposal passes, the Atom One constitution will be finalized with additional input from the community and expert lawyers. The final constitution will then require another proposal vote to ratify. The spirit of the latest draft

"ATOM2.0 will split the community in half

## The community is split, 50% 50% if ATOM2.0 passes it will lead to a community split or a fork.

If we count only stakers direct vote on ATOM2.0 we get this distribution: 
Yes 12,964,821 ATOM
No 279,703 ATOM
NWV 11,830,808 ATOM 
Abstain 520361 ATOM
Clearly the proposal is extremely controversial, stakers are split 50% 50%, its also not popular as the majority of those 30k addresses are actually just bots using low balances and dust to influence perception of voters (snapshot as of Saturday) 
Seems like some external factors are influencing validators neutral representation of delegators.
If the vote were to be unbiased the validator vote would represent the same distribution as the stakers vote, so why we ask why the validator vote is skewed towards yes.
This justifies no with veto as a way for validators to protect the real interests of delegators, 50% of the delegator voting power is in disagreement its not a small minority.

## ATOM2.0 treasury allocation described by Zaki and Youssef

Dilute 44m ATOMs and split:

- Consumer chains 10%

- The other 90% (risky speculative bets)
1 Invest in Cosmos early ventures
2 LP positions 
3 token swaps
4 Lending
5 incentives to boost adoption of ATOM backed stable-coins 

Explain to us why this is not worse than Alameda, dilute other peoples capital and gamble with it.

If the 90% used for gambling were to be removed then we would be left with a 4/5m ATOMs needed to fund consumer chains a more reasonable target which would be easily funded without the need for dilution but rather through a higher community pool tax (the tax shouldn't be in perpetuity and we should target a test amount for the first year not the full 4m).

The part of the proposal about speculating with stakers capital on LPing, loans, etc.. should be removed or Cosmos will just end up being the Do Kwon/ Luna/SBF/Alameda/FTX/Su Zhu of next cycle.

ATOM 2 is just gambling:
- 50% of LP positions are at a loss https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09192
- 90% of LP tokens eventually become rugpulls https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07220
- VCs don't make money, 50% don't return 1x https://medium.com/the-mission/the-meeting-that-showed-me-the-truth-about-vcs-and-how-they-don-t-make-money-ab72b52b50cd
- Staking derivatives have extremely low profitability which doesn't justify the enormous risk and centralization pressure they impose on the hub, Eth staking derivatives cannot beat the yield of US treasuries, ETH/stETH is nominally at a loss and yielding less then 3%, ATOM staking derivatives have 3k daily volume which will translate in ridiculously low APR
- Liabilities are not revenue https://pastebin.com/fVQ81d7H FTT is a liability, when GAAP is applied. See current systemic risk. 

Not one of ATOM2.0 proposers has ever managed any money, nor they have consulted any money manager, they have zero history of AUM peformance.


## The ICF is behind ATOM2.0

ATOM 2.0 is a proposal by the ICF, no matter how much they deny, 2 ICF members (one senior) are cosigners (Ethan and Sam) we find it also very telling that they planned re-delegations at the same time as the ATOM2.0 vote, they will surely use those to reward compliant validators after the vote.
After ATOM 2.0 gets implemented it will strengthen the case for ATOM to become a security as the treasury will be profit seeking and revenue sharing and ICF might be regarded as the issuing party as they are the main entity behind the ATOM2.0 paper and were one of the biggest entities during the ICO genesis allocation.
Usually dilution is seen as the last alternative for financing and it’s a sign of a failing firm that can not gather funding in other ways, it’s the last chance, when you have no other option left, is the ICF solvent? 

Why does a centralized council need to be created when the community pool works just fine? See Evmos for example. 
Anything in Atom 2.0 can be done slowly, while Cosmos reaps the reward of ICS, while 90% of chains like Solana fail, Cosmos took the turtle approach and got rewarded by being one of the best performers in the last year, now ICS is about to launch. Let’s see how it develops before committing to a highly risky plan, and please lets not split the community, lets abandon controversial changes.

"Community Health research, analytics, and benchmarking

## Summary
If Web3 is all about communities, how do we know if we're heading in the right direction?
We've been advancing a research project to:
* develop a framework for Community Health with actionable metrics
* create an open source data collection tool
* implement the tool in Cosmos Hub and others
* analyse the interactions and perceptions data to validate the framework and provide insights to advance the Cosmos community.
We're seeking $30,000 or equivalent as grant match-funding to complete the project.
For clarity, the output of this grant is a community health assessment (including conceptual framework, designing KPIs, building the data collection tool, etc). And a range of more specific, actionable insights on how to improve community health. We cant say what the specific insights are before doing the research, though.
## About RnDAO
We're an R&D DAO with a mission to empower humane collaboration. Having already delivered research projects on sub-DAOs, DAO Conceptual Foundations, Decentralised Leadership, DAO Compensation and more: http:// rndao.mirror.xyz
## Abstract
Like many others, Cosmos depends on the health of its community and its vibez—yet understanding and measuring these factors (what we call Community Health) is challenging.
Today, Web3 communities are left to rely on infrequent transactions data (on-chain records), while data from the significantly more frequent social interactions is limited to basic indicators of Discord or Discourse, Web2-oriented bots like Statsbot that give simplistic measurements, or a patchwork of “homemade” surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are ill-suited for DAO communities, surveys are time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results of these approaches, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.
Perhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders and members without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market crashes, protocol migrations, etc.).
## Specification
For the conceptual framework, we have assembled a team including two PhDs in network science and an organisation designer with significant DAO and community building experience to bridge both theory and practice. We've reviewed over 50 papers on the topics of Community, Social Network Analysis, Resilience, Trust, Engagement, and more. And are synthesising all of these findings to define the key indicators that have high validity and high predictive capacity for community health, while also taking a holistic perspective that accounts for member's wellbeing and planning to collect data across communities to offer an ecosystem health scrore too.
For the data collection tool, we're going beyond traditional surveys.
This research proposal focuses on the use of two critical techniques as a starting point:
Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how communications, information, and value creation occur through an organization based on interaction graphs. ONA has been shown to provide a wide range of insights to improve contributor retention, avoid member burnout, predict team performance and community resilience, identify key contributors, enable decentralization, and improve coordination. Although relatively new, ONA is gaining in popularity over traditional survey tools.
Pulse Surveys are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide qualitative and quantitative insights. In traditional organizations, they have been shown to increase employee response rate and employee engagement with related initiatives. They're also used as a tool for culture design and implementing culture change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys significantly reduce admin work for community managers and related roles. Importantly, these surveys offer an opt-out option from future prompts and are also framed to leverage coaching techniques to offer a prompt for reflection, thus offering value to participants as a recentering exercise on the value of community.
The data is anonymised and collected in a central repository for this first phase (we're exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a team having received ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should it be misused.
## Rationale
The techniques used (ONA based on communication and Pulse Surveys) provide maximum insights on Community Health compared with exclusively on-chain data analysis. And provide minimum disruption for community members and minimal admin compared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially, the techniques selected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation by those less likely to respond to long surveys e.g. those less engaged and thus likely with the most valuable feedback to give.
Although our initial focus is Community Health metrics, the proposed approach sets the foundation for further applications. Some of the potential applications and insights for Cosmos Hub and Cosmos-Chains-based DAOs are:
* Generate baseline metrics for Community Health / vibez to quantify and better understand the impact that a specific event is having on a community and/or sub-groups within the community
* Predict which contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive action (without breaching privacy
* Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for improvement
* Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or Insights metrics
* Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment, community experience, etc. in near real-time
* Attract talent and investment with objective Community Health metrics instead of proxy metrics like member count or proposal count, or financial metrics such as TVL
In addition to the initial research on Community Health, the potential applications mentioned above can enable more effective and targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities.

## FAQ
**What kind of insights can this proposal deliver?**
Although part of the work is precisely figuring out what metrics to use and which to discard, weve already spent significant time developing [a framework to define community and community health](https://rndao.mirror.xyz/F-SMj6p_jdYvrMMkR1d9Hd6YbEg39qItTKfjo-zkgqM) and will use this as our starting point, further refining with feedback from the community.
**How will the insights add value to Cosmos?**
A weak community will fall apart in the face of difficulties while a strong community will come together stronger. The insights enable the Cosmos community to understand which areas to target with initiatives so to improve community health. Instead of shooting in the dark, the insights provide strategic focus and clarity.
**Will this proposal have a continuation?**
This is very much the start of what could become an ongoing workstream of research and action. Were hoping the community is satisfied with this pilot so that we can then make subsequent proposals to both deepen the research further and action insights to make the community stronger.

**What reassurance can you provide for accountability?**
Were part of a DAO thats been around for over a year, and both the DAO and we, the leads of this proposal, have invested a hundred plus hours building up our reputation in the space with the names and social profiles we have disclosed. The reputational damage would cost multiple times the 30k being requested (not even counting the lost opportunity of building trust with the Cosmos community so we may make subsequent proposals). Of course, theres an uncertainty component, as with any R&D initiative, but you can count on us to do everything in our power to make this a success.",0.3611364229736367

## Change log

* 2023-02-4 New post after a feedback cycle

## Summary

On-chain submission redacted for length. Read Full Proposal here: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVr8zLF4KWTTNQ2wAyuSHygfEURrg2nP33b6aXrd19uDE

On Dec. 19, 2022, Cosmos Hub [Prop 88](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-88-accepted-increasing-hub-community-tax/8267) was accepted, and a tax was created to fund the community pool, ongoing. This large pool of capital is used for ecosystem growth through grants, development, and community building.

This new tax signals that the community is not content with the growth of the Hub, specifically for maintenance, development, grants, and funding.

With the signaling proposal of the V9 Lambda launch, Interchain Security (ICS), consumer chains, and Replicated Security are quickly becoming reality. A new narrative is emerging for the Cosmos Hub, a sustainable stream of real yield to $ATOM stakers. The Cosmos Hub has seen the emergence of 54 appchains. 

The consumer chain narrative is new, untested, and relatively unknown to teams outside the Cosmos ecosystem. We will take on this challenge and change this.

Our 3 objectives:

1) Make over 1,000 developer teams Cosmos-aware. Create a developer and project awareness campaign around Replicated Security, IBC, and the consumer chain narrative.

2) Support Replicated Security. AlphaGrowth will find, educate, recruit, and deploy grants to 20 or more DeFi projects that will launch on consumer chains. We will help find, educate, and recruit 1–2 consumer chain candidates.

3) Map infrastructure and utility for consumer chains and map, foster, and communicate increases in ATOM utility.

## Details

For more than 18 months, AlphaGrowth has helped acquire developers and dApps on behalf of ecosystems. In 2022, we helped source thousands of conversations and 40+ dApps deployed on Aurora EVM. In late 2022, we began working with Kava EVM to drive adoption of the DeFi narrative. Within two months, we helped drive 14 new dApps to Kava and continue to drive 10–15 dApps each month. Example projects we brought to different chains: https://alphagrowth.notion.site/AlphaGrowth-Grants-Program-e8357b57a4c742509cd01cf81183d619

"Legal Defense Fund Proposal

## Community Pool Spend

The full text of this proposal is available via IPFS link: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeS7wp1mpkgLrXEosaL4d517aNKcfvzhDKdSy2XGGWjCY/QmcJtFw4xUpBuDoRNRKQeMCaZDuz7THemgWwc9Htv5Zghk

**Recipient:** Grace Yu Legal Defense Team
**Amount:** 50,000 ATOM (~approx $610,000 at current prices)

**Summary:** 

On 3/23/23, All in Bits, Inc., (AiB) filed a legal complaint against Grace Yu, a former AIB contractor, for the alleged breach of a mutual non-disparagement clause. AiB seeks damages to be determined at trial, and asks the amount be “not less than $150,000.” 

In our view, the lawsuit initiated by AiB constitutes a tortious act, which may result in unwarranted scrutiny and legal implications for $ATOM and the Cosmos network.  Let it be known that AiB has filed and financed a frivolous lawsuit against a community member utilizing funds given to them for the assumed propagation and development of open-source software. 

It is our utmost concern that AiB initiated this legal action without a sound basis in a federal court lacking genuine jurisdiction, rendering the Cosmos network vulnerable to ramifications of AiB’s pleadings that declare the core technology framework to be both centralized and dominated by a founding Cosmos entity. 

In light of this negative precedent established with AiB’s lawsuit, the objective of this proposal is to rectify the situation with a positive, restorative precedent. This proposal is designed to lend unequivocal support to Grace – for her fortitude in prioritizing the public interest in our public goods, over the limited interests of a private entity. 

At this critical growth juncture, it is paramount that we assertively demand radical transparency from our founding organizations; however, this goal is rendered unachievable when tort systems are exploited to effect intimidation and harassment. 

We earnestly implore the community to consider the full contents of this proposal, as its approval will signify and secure a commitment of resources needed to defend Grace and provide evidence to the American fiat courts that the Cosmos ecosystem – that our code and our culture, are truly decentralized products and experiences. 

 The full text of this proposal is available via [IPFS link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeS7wp1mpkgLrXEosaL4d517aNKcfvzhDKdSy2XGGWjCY/QmcJtFw4xUpBuDoRNRKQeMCaZDuz7THemgWwc9Htv5Zghk)*

**Objective:* 

Based on projected costs provided by law firms, we are requesting 50,000 ATOM to secure competent legal representation for Grace Yu. Grace will be seeking reimbursement for all legal costs and expenses from AIB.  Grace will work with Notional for any remittance/reimbursement of funds back to the Cosmos Hub community pool.

As of 4/5/23, AiB has communicated that in the event the Cosmos Hub passes a funding proposal for Grace’s legal defense fund, AiB “will reimburse the Cosmos community for the portion used.” 

In the event the outcome of a settlement or a trial works in favor of the petitioner, and damages are awarded to AiB; Grace will not use any of the funds allocated to pay for damages. Funds allocated will be used strictly for her legal defense, only. 

**Arrangement:** 

In the circumstance of successful passage of this proposal, the liquidation of ATOM will be executed in two tranches. The initial tranche will entail 25,000 ATOM which are to be converted into USDC by the undersigned parties of the multisig wallet after obtaining 2/3 authorization. Should the motion to dismiss the lawsuit prove to be unviable, this will trigger the second and concluding tranche which will liquidate the remaining 25,000 ATOM. 

In the situation whereby AiB withdraws the lawsuit, and no legal costs and fees are awarded, the remainder of the designated legal funding, and its unspent balance will be duly restored to the hub. 

1.In the event the lawsuit settles, and Grace is awarded legal costs and fees without personal or compensatory damages, she will use those funds to reimburse the community pool in full, and will not retain any of the payment until the community pool is fully reimbursed. 
2. In the event Grace is unable to claim reimbursement of legal fees from AiB, and should there be unused funds remaining at the conclusion of the matter, she will return the balance of the funds using MsgFundCommunityPool. 
3. In the event Grace is awarded any personal and compensatory damages, separate from legal costs and fees, she will remit 33.33% of awarded damages (post tax) back to the hub, any reimbursement of legal costs and fees, in addition to any balance remaining from her her legal defense fund using MsgFundCommunityPool. 

Note on flow 

i. This proposal seeks 50,000 ATOM 
ii. The multisig group will transfer ATOM to Osmosis to convert ATOM to USDC. 
iii. USDC will be sent to Grace’s law firm via Bitpay transaction. 
iv. Grace’s law firm will provide a written letter to confirm receipt of funds, and that letter and redacted invoices will be uploaded to the Cosmos hub forum. Redactions are necessary to protect the attorney-client privilege, as well as Grace. 

**Transparency** 

Monthly legal invoices will be uploaded to www.dropthelawsuit.org. Narrative descriptions of work performed on the invoices will be redacted to preserve privacy, along with work-product and attorney-client privileged information. Once the matter of AiB v Grace Yu is settled, Grace will provide a report as to how the funds were spent. Providing a transparency report during the course of litigation would compromise the discretion her legal team requires to execute on tactical objectives and could waive the attorney-client privilege. 

**Why We Need to Fund #FreeGrace #dropthelawsuit:** 

* Cosmos is an assemblage of software components that operate under the open source model.
* Compliance with regulatory requirements necessitates the decentralization of Cosmos code. 
* Open-source developers are afforded the privilege of seamlessly migrating their work alone or under the auspices and sponsorship of different organizations; hence, any practice that opposes open-source tenets, such as the AiB modus operandi, is not only contrary to established open-source norms but also undermines the fostering of an innovative culture that is indispensable for the competitive propagation of software code. 
* Multilateral contributions to open source software frameworks is perceived as an indicator of maturity and resilience.  An increase in diverse contributions to open-source software amplifies its reach, thereby guaranteeing a more thorough review process. This is in line with the well-known adage that “more eyes make for fewer bugs.”  
* Due to Grace’s advocacy, a former Tendermint and Ignite contributor, Denis Fadeev is now free to engage in activities of his choosing – including the ability to continue work on the project he created independent of AiB. This outcome is attributable to Denis’ persistence, supported by the efforts of the #FreeDenis community facilitated by Grace Yu. 
* While we recognize that the values of the Cosmos may not appear coherent at first glance, there is a fundamental alignment that we all share. This alignment, is the inalienable right to freedom of speech, and the freedom of expression. 
* Protecting these freedoms are necessary to evince an alternative decentralized financial system dependent on radical transparency, accountability, open-source, and decentralization for legitimacy and resilience. 
* The Cosmos Hub will be exercising its sovereign authority to protect a community member from a founding organization in a manner that is both unprecedented and essential to preserving the values vital to the Cosmos vision. 
* The Cosmos Hub would indirectly assert itself in a matter being adjudicated in a fiat court, in the prestigious Eastern District of New York.

"Nullify proposal 75

The cosmos hub has an elegant method for dealing with spam, known as veto. It deals with genuine spam proposals very well. But what does it mean under the hood? Well, what it means under the hood is that you vote for no and you vote for veto at the same time, you’re making two votes. If the tally for veto reaches 33%, the deposit on the proposal is burned and the proposal automatically fails.

Since there is absolutely no way to mandate a definition of spam and everybody is going to interpret that differently and it makes no sense whatsoever to argue about that, I propose that we nullify proposal 75, AND free the authors of governance proposals from writing tedious vote options because those are defined very well in the software. Luckily, our community is more than intelligent enough to interpret on their own, what the vote options do, and the documentation of the vote options is highly effective.

Finally, I believe that it makes sense to require only explaining the yes option, as doing otherwise can land a punter in hot water.

Therefore, to make governance simpler in all ways, and increase participation in governance, and remove the crazy burn two sticks of incense and say 10 hail Marys before approaching Cosmos hub governance to save thyself from Gaia’s proceduralist faction, we should do the logical thing, and require only that YES, be defined. All other vote options are defined by the underlying software and its documentation.

vote YES to nullify proposal 75, require that YES be defined, and use all other vote options as described by the cosmos-sdk.

The original proposer of Proposal #9 made a change thinking the `DurationUntilDecay` period is denominated in seconds, when it should be specified in nanoseconds. This is a reasonable misunderstanding as the network query for this param mistakenly returns a value denominated in seconds, i.e. this query: `evmosd query claims params` previously resulted in a response of: `duration_until_decay: 3801600s`.

"Parameter change: Enable the inflation module

## Author

Daniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team

## Parameter being changed with this proposal

If successful, this proposal will enable the inflation module on Evmos by changing the `ParamStoreKeyEnableInflation` parameter from `false` to `true`. This propsal has a voting time of 5 days.

## Motivation

When the chain initially launched, the inflation module was enabled and new Evmos tokens were minted and allocated according to the Evmos Token Model once a day until the chain halted. After the halt, Evmos relaunched with the inflation module disabled for two main reasons:

* ensure that the chain is secure and chain upgrades are successful
* give more time to those who hadn't been able to claim their airdrop

## Impact

Now, that several upgrades have passed successfully on-chain and more users have claimed their airdrop, inflation could be enabled. Enabling this module activates

* staking rewards,
* usage incentives and
* community pool allocation.

## Discussion

Before voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4965-enable-inflation-module). For an in-depth explanation of the module, please refer to the [module specification](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/inflation/).

## Testing on Testnet

With [proposal 28](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/28) the inflation module has already been enabled on Testnet. Please take part in testing its correctness by

* staking tokens: You should receive staking rewards once a day
* interacting with registered usage incentives: You should be able to query your gas meters after interacting with an incentivized smart contract. Once a week, your gas meters are reset and you receive Evmos tokens from the incentives pool based on how much gas you spent on interacting with incentivized smart contracts. The incentives pool fills up once a day through inflation
* querying the community pool: a part of inflation is allocated in the community pool once a day. Query the community pool to make sure it's increasing according to the [Evmos Token Model](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b).

Note, that the team allocation of the Evmos Token Model is not handled through inflation but instead was implemented with vesting accounts.",0.002901185080190438

Full proposal (on IPFS): https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf7wwUCzPfBZLcmkv4UkbfVU4xA5SkyjvCxVcpc3jtq5z 

Prior commonwealth discussion (draft version): https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4926-1m-evmos-developer-incentive-program-proposal-from-web3scholarship-program

Proposal:
* Web3Scholarship program, the Web3 funding & incuabtion vehicle, which is funded by Huobi Incubator and with members including Dorahacks, Dao Maker etc., is proposing a $1m hackathon like developer incentive program on Evmos
* Web3Scholarhip program is chain agnostic and supporting ecosystem building including Avalanche, Dfinity etc. Web3Scholarship initiate collaborations driven by research, Evmos Included. We’re bullish on Evmos
* The goal for the hackathon event is to support ecosystem building after launch at a critical market condition. Incentives include $500k grants, over $500k investment, at least $10m liquidity, express IDO/IEO listing and incubation/advisory support to winning teams deployed on Evmos
* It is proposed to have a 50-50 split of grants between Evmos community & Web3scholarship and sponsors, where $250k worth of Evmos tokens are asked for as grants to winning teams. Venture funding and liquidity come from Web3scholarship.
* What we ask from Evmos community: 125,000 Evmos tokens (assuming Evmos price of $2USD according to roughly last 14 day average price). The principle is to provide $250k worth of Evmos tokens, therefore the actual number of tokens distributed may depend on future price performance close to (average 30 day Evmos token price prior) initial prize distribution i.e. the winning team announcement date . If > $2, no more tokens are needed and remaining undistributed tokens stay at Evmos community. If less, then vice versa applies(open to revision).
* Prize tracks: Grand prize(80k), Defi/Infra/ Web3/Metaverse Track prize (100k*4), EVM Migration prize (20k)



Reasoning and Potential Impact:
* After Evmos mainnet is live and network is stable, it creates good window for ecosystem building whereas currently there is only Evmos limited grant available for devs. 
* The goal is to incentivize growth of key pillars of DeFi, NFT and Infrastructure of Evmos ecosystem at early stage, and teams of high aptitude will see a tangible leap in terms of performance and adoption via incentives and incubation.
* Web3Scholarship is diverse & strong to provide attractive incentives and valuable incubation. The event is likely to get momentum for the ecosystem and ahchieve network effect.



Deliverables and Timeline:
The whole event will firstly take 1 month planning starting from now and 1 and half months for the actual event. Event period is planned to be from July 7 to August 22. During which, Evmos specific developer support such as AMA and tutorials will be offered. 


Success Factors:
* Goals: It is expected to have over 1,000 developers signed in, over 60 submissions and produce 3-5 investable projects and 1-2 flagships.
* Avoid rug: strict scrutiny; code review; criteria; penalty clause
* Quality projects: selective criteria; dev turnout: referrals
* Dev turnout: galvanizing 10+ communities including Devpost, Dorahacks
* Community engagement: will utilize hack platform to involve community vote in the selection of winning teams. 

Protection clause: Penalty and protection clause to be made so event host & sponsor are entitled to reject or make conditional fund provision.

Distribution transparency:
To ensure a proper and synchronized grant distribution from both Evmos and Web3Scholarship, gnosis safe will be established and used for offering grants.

At last, features industry wide collaboration & contribution, we hope to spur growth at this critical point of time by this event. Thanks for your time to read this proposal and we apppreciate your support.",0.05893481913078783
"Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network

View the discussion and full proposal here: 

 https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5320-grant-request-to-sponsor-evmos-public-rpc-by-pocket-network 

 This proposal is seeking funding to sponsor daaps of the EVMOS community with Pocket Network RPC usage. Developers will be able to mint secure endpoints via https://www.portal.pokt.network/ and benefit from our dev rel support, and endpoint security features. Additionally, we will provide a public-exposed endpoint. ( There is one we are already contributing to at https://evmos-json-rpc.stakely.io/ ).

 Pocket Network is a decentralized RPC service that enables a permissionless network of independent node operators to be incentivized for running full nodes for blockchains supported by the network. Daaps pay for RPC throughput by staking POKT token, and node operators are compensated in POKT token based on RPC requests served. The beauty of this model is a positive feedback loop that is created: as the usage of the RPC increases, the incentive payout for node runners also increases, thus incentivizing more full nodes to spin up and strengthening the overall RPC service. 

 This model reduces central points of failure within the RPC layer, while increasing geographic distribution, redundancy, and censorship resistance.  We currently support over 20 blockchain networks including many popular EVM protocols.  We have recently added support for Evmos EVM mainnet.

 By sponsoring daap’s usage of Pocket RPC within the EVMOS community we are contributing to decentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship resistance of the network.",0.04136821274853638
"Evmos Mainnet v6.0.1 Upgrade

## Author

Daniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team

## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal

If successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [1,042,000
](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/1042000) (Estimated Target Date: Mon Jul 04 2022 19:16:07 GMT+0200) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v6.0.1](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.

## Motivation

By proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).

## Impact

On a high level, the  software includes the following improvements:

* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with  names to be sent over IBC
* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the  and  fee market parameters.
* Allow Metamask transactions with min gas price
* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance
* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates

Software upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:

* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds
* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with 
* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged
* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors
* Set the  param value to  (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))
* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas

A full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1).

## Testing

The Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).

## Discussion

Before voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5922-evmos-software-upgrade-v601).",0.0010482118883773002

"Evmos external incentives on Osmosis

Summary:

This proposal is to fund Evmos external incentives on Osmosis. It requests 600,000 Evmos from the community pool for EVMOS/OSMO Pool 722. The rewards would be distributed over the course of 90 days for 14 day bonding time only. This would amount to 5555.56 per day in external rewards.

The funds will be managed by a multisig wallet at the address below, and includes the following members:

- bennylava - Evmos Community Manager/Evmos Governance Workstream
- Tricky - Cosmos Spaces / Evmos Governance Workstream
- LPX - Evmos Governance Workstream
- JohnnyWyles - Osmosis Labs

Weighted 3/4

Goals
External incentives in Osmosis, [pool 722](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/722) would help deepen Evmos liquidity on Osmosis resulting in lower slippage and stronger TVL. It would also support new user adoption by making the Evmos pool a desirable location to earn yield for Osmosis community members who have not interacted with Evmos yet. Externally rewarded pools in Osmosis boosts OSMO incentives as well. Based on the current high swap returns, Osmosis would be matching these external incentives 1:1 with OSMO rewards See Osmosis [proposal 264](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/264). Lastly, the external incentives will be issued daily in the form of the Evmos token to those bonded in the liquidity pool. This new liquidity will allow Osmosis users to explore the Evmos ecosystem by checking out Evmos EVM applications or help secure the network via staking.

"Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs

**Who We Are:**

I'm Hsin-Ju, founder & CEO of Dystopia Labs (http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we've hosted 449+ workshops and 15 summits with reach in 18+ countries. With over 28,000+ registrants for our events, we've built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, & more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.


**Why Our Proposal Matters:**

Since Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there's a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.

- Dystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming two events: Hacksummit SF (a 2 day summit right before Stanford Blockchain Conference) and DeFi Bogota (a 1 day summit right before Devcon).
- We are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $30k. This will help cover venue costs, AV support, furniture, and food.
- We expect 300-350 ppl per event. And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we'd love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.
- To us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.
- In the past, we've had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot's team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.
- Other sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.


**We're Part Of The Ecosystem:**

Our goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor through events.
-------------- 
Notes added by governance:

- At the time of writing, Evmos is around $2.15. $30K is roughly 13,954 EVMOS when rounded up.

# **Summary**

This proposal will provide the funding necessary needed for the sponsorship of the upcoming HackAtom 2022 event in Seoul which will be held July 29th to 31th, followed by the participation in ETH Seoul and Korea Blockchain Week which ends on 14th of August. The HackAtom hackathon will also kick off the first of many events planned for [discoverEVMOS](https://evmos.builders), a developer onboarding and network growth initiative.

---

# **Abstract**

HackAtom is the largest and most recognized hackathon in the Cosmos ecosystem, organized by the Interchain Foundation with its history dating [back to 2017](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-cosmos-hackatom-winners-9fc083098da). A lot has happened since 2017 -- even as the world was momentarily flipped upside down, the Cosmos ecosystem continued to build, and #IBCgang as a whole has achieved countless milestones that the early builders have dreamed of.

Evmos is incredibly special in that it has the best of both worlds - EVM and Cosmos. In fact, Evmos exists today because of [Cosmos Hub Proposal #44](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-44-accepted-advancing-ethermint-gtm-and-engineering-plan-for-the-ethermint-chain/4554)

---

 ## **The Event** 

**Announcing Cosmos’s HackATOM Seoul**

HackAtom Seoul, Organized by Interchain in collaboration with the talented KryptoSeoul team, will be our first in-person Hackathon since 2019 and the first Cosmos-branded event in the Asian continent since the pandemic began. The full announcement [can be read here](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-cosmoss-hackatom-seoul-b6858b9beac7).

**Participating IBC Frens:**

* Cosmos Hub, Interchain Foundation, Cosmostation, Osmosis, Crescent, Juno, plus more (check announcement).

**Date**: July 29-31
**Location**: Hanwha Dreamplus, Seoul

---

 ## **Community Funding Request** 

The requested amount as it stands is $168K, with the bulk of it going towards hackathon prizes and developer outreach. $50K allocated for marketing and PR will come from the waived sponsorship fee from Interchain Foundation.

 **A. Sponsorship Fees**

Platinum Sponsorship Package (Fee Waived) Includes:

* 1 booth at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 1 judging seat at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 1 workshop at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 10-minute speaker spot at the Welcome Ceremony, Day 1 
* Co-host at Official Afterparty at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* Evmos marketing one-pager included in Welcome Packet 
* HackAtom badges printed with your Evmos under Platinum Sponsor 
* Evmos logo insignia on the marketing video produced during HackAtom Seoul 2022

### **B. Hackathon Prizes**

The prize amount was selected simply based on the amount that Osmosis and Juno are offering ($100K each). 

[Current Hackathon Challenges and Prize Pool](https://bafybeienbj44fytisfpq6a5svc5t32qcxgwjvdkqejfys2degjnhhotbkm.ipfs.dweb.link/tracks.png)

The final hackathon tracks will be discussed and determined with the core dev team as well as with consultation from evmos4volunteers.

### **C. Marketing and PR Expenses**

The numbers that I am providing are currently derived as best estimates from my past experiences with sponsoring and hosting events. Past events include Blockshow Vegas 2018, BlockchainNW Seattle 2018, LA Blockchain Week 2018, Global AI Conference in Santa Clara, Consensys 2019, LA Blockchain Week 2019, E3 2019 blockchain gaming, and a dozen smaller meetups. 

**PR Expenses** - Evmos is unique in the Cosmos ecosystem because we are able to tap into a much bigger pool of developers (devs already familiar with solidity). It is my belief that if we are committing $100K into the hackathon, we should do our absolute best to make sure that there is a great turnout with talented developers. 

Right off the bat, I would like to explore one or two paid PR placements in Korea's top blockchain publications and developer networks. Depending on who, when, and how, this can range anywhere from $5K to $10K. However, we will aim for the lower-end of the range while leveraging the existing network of IBC frens.

I will be consulting a few blockchain incubation and investment firms that I am acquainted with for additional advice on how to best penetrate the Korean ETH developer market. There may be some last minute promotions, such as small token giveaways or ad placements in developer-heavy social networks. 

**Marketing Expenses** - Following the HackAtom event, three events will be held consecutively: buidl.asia, ETH Seoul, and Korea Blockchain Week. This gives us a great opportunity to do further outreach beyond the scope of the hackathon, through smaller meetups, cross-promotions, and related events. Side events, when executed properly, can be much more effective than sponsoring the event itself. 

From start to finish, the events will last from July 29th to August 13th. This is a pretty epic blockchain marathon, and the possilities and opportunities for developer onboarding, meetups, workships, and side events are endless. 

**Booth and Evmos Merch** - Because of the limited time to prepare, booth design and merch will likely have to be rushed. After speaking with Interchain Foundation and the HackAtom organizers, booth design will not require a significant budget.

Around $2K will be allocated for Evmos merch / swag.

### **D. Airfare + Accomodations + Miscellaneous Expenses**

For those that have boothed at crypto events, you'll know that _it is not easy._ I have discussed with BeeHive, a respected Korean validator and community that is active in Evmos as well as other Cosmos chains, and have confirmed their willingness to help boothing as well as provide translation services. While the event will bring the global community to Seoul, it should be expected that a huge portion of the attendees will, of course be Korean. 

At the moment airfare to Korea from the States as well as Europe are well over $2K. Assuming that four Evmos representaives will in attendance, the cost for airfare should exceed just over $10K. Prices will likely fluctuate between now and then. Accomodation for housing is showing anywhere from $4K to $6K for the time periods of the events.

Loredana from evmos4volunteers has been requested to attend to assist with technical discussions, which the community seems to be overwhelming in favor for. We are waiting for a final confirmation from loredana.

## **Fund Usage, Transparency, and Accountability** 

1. All expenses incurred will be documented and itemized, from A to D. Whatever  transactions that can be done on chain will be done so. For expenses that require fiat, an expense report will be provided after the event. 
2. All unused funds will be returned to the community pool.
3. $20K of the marketing and PR budget will be sent to a multi-sig wallet, while $20K will be held in a liquid wallet so that we can immediately get to work on the countless tasks and preparations that need to be made. 
4. The hackathon prize pool will also be sent to a multi-sig wallet and distributed post-event.
5. I will work with the core team to be as frugal as possible, while consulting with them to take as many opportunities that would benefit Evmos and help with onboarding and exposure.

## **Time Constraints** 

July 29th is fast approaching. I will continue to be in constant contact with the HackAtom organizers, blockchain incubators and communities, and everyone in between.

## **Other Considerations** 

We have decided not to sponsor KBW directly, but have confirmed with KBW organizers that whatever side event we decide to host, they will include it in their official list of events, which allows us to tap into their pool of attendees. With that being said, if at any point or time something doesn't feel right, or we feel that our spending is not justified, we can simply decide to not host anything, and return the remaining funds to the community pool.

## Multisig Signatories

3 out of 5 signatories for multisig execution is proposed:
- LPX (myself, who will be coordinating much of logistics here in Seoul)
- Three team members / volunteer in attendance (Adonis, Tricky, and Loredana if she is able to make it)
- One team member not present in Korea.

Full discussion:
https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6454-judge-me-sponsor-a-volunteer-researcher-for-evminterchain-lobby-for-evmos

**Loredana's (evmos4volunteers, The Laurel Project) proposal for Evmos:**
""Continue my volunteer work on EVM Inter-Chain, by formalizing the protocols, creating new inter-chain standards (like we started with IC_ERC20, IC_ERC721), extending nBridge for CosmWasm (EVM -- CosmWasm nBridge).
For this work to have a chance of adoption, I need to be close to Evmos, Cosmos, Interchain Foundation & other Cosmos blockchain teams. And the best location for me to influence the future tech for the benefit of the Evmos blockchain is Berlin. I would personally like to continue my work remotely and transparently (e.g. github, videos), but I found that it is very hard for other people to collaborate without face-to-face meetings.
**The Evmos community would only sponsor my rent in Berlin (apartment + office), effectively sponsoring my lobby services, for the benefit of Evmos. My tech effort will remain a volunteer contribution, unpaid.**

## Why should Evmos sponsor lobbying?
Because a multi-chain standard (like I am proposing) requires a controller chain to have a correct state view. This controller chain can be Evmos. See my 2 HackATOM videos: https://youtu.be/j5CVliOb-Ck and https://youtu.be/Khqv-1TbsMo .
""

In Berlin, Loredana would be available for technical conferences for the benefit of Evmos.

"The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO

**Summary:** The Governance workstream is asking the community for a formal awknowledgement and ratification of Evmos DAO's Interim Constitution through this vote.

**Background:** The Governance workstream, with the blessing from the core team, has been working for several months researching case-studies, idealogies and philosophies in decentralized orgs, and all the various governance frameworks and styles of long standing DAOs — all for the eventual launch of Evmos DAO.

In the best interest of the community and the growth of the Evmos ecosystem, we have decided to move forward with an Interim Constitution to allow the Governance workstream to begin rolling out our governance framework in a modular basis, ultimately allowing for the creation of workstreams and special growth initiatives. The ratification of the Interim Constitution can be seen as the first of many steps in the formation of Evmos DAO.

This Interim Constitution has been in ideation and discussion for over a month, including [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6082-final-rfc-the-evmos-constitution), The Evmos Validator Fairness Initiative group, and multiple weekly governance calls.

---

# The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO

## Preamble: The Declaration

We, the Evmos Community, formally declare our shared beliefs and mission to build and assist in growing the Evmos network. We strive to be the leading EVM network in the Cosmos Ecosystem, utilizing the Cosmos SDK modules, Tendermint's consensus engine, and the Inter Blockchain Protocol for a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, interoperable chain. The Evmos network, our community, and our governance processes must strive to play a role in laying the foundation for a more equitable, hyper-connected, decentralized future.

## 1. The Evmos Community

The Evmos Community (""community"") is a general all-encompassing term that comprises various groups that are participants in the Evmos network. The level and degree of participation may vary by group, but the common denominator of all members of the community should be the shared interest in the continued growth of the Evmos network.

**1. Protocol Developers** - this group of developers focuses mainly on improving the Evmos network on the protocol level; this group includes core developers as well as individual contributors not considered as core team members.

**2. Network Validators** - network validators are key members of the community responsible for securing the network through the Tendermint proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

**3. Network Delegators** - network delegators are the predominant group that assist in network consensus and security by delegating power to validators through the staking of tokens.

**4. Workstream and Committee Members** - workstream and committee members are those that work to improve and grow the Evmos network on a non-protocol level.

**5. Community Leaders** - workstreams and special projects, although not required, may have an appointed leader to steward and lead his or her group.

**6. Application Developers and End Users** - application developers and end users are those that develop, deploy, utilize, interact, transact, and ultimately bring value to the Evmos ecosystem.

While the aforementioned groups make up the majority of the community, the definition and composition of the community are not strictly limited to these groups.

## 2. The Evmos Governance Framework

The Evmos Governance Framework (""framework"") is the foundational set of guidelines and processes developed for the community and network contributors to follow and flourish. The framework should be designed to recognize and incentivize contributors and curate a culture that creates long-term, positive-sum interactions between all community members and the Evmos ecosystem.

The framework is to be proposed and adopted separately from the Constitution. The Constitution shall take priority over the Governance Framework and should be regarded as the supreme guiding document.

## 3. Guiding Principles

**1. Progressive Decentralization:** The Evmos network aims to be as decentralized as possible, in the context of network validation as well as governance and finances. While network resiliency and the decentralization of power is paramount, we recognize the need to proceed with strategic and scientific-based planning. The community must not haphazardly rush into decisions that may potentially destabilize the chain or provoke a strong negative community reaction. The community will take the stance of progressive decentralization as we research and analyze the social, legal, and/or financial ramifications our decisions may potential have.

**2. Neutrality and Non-Partisanship:** We believe in the principles of equality for all and must act in accordance with this core principle. All groups and community members have equal access to information, equal rights, and equal responsibilities, as defined by this Constitution. No one group or community member should be favored over any other members. No one group or community member should be disfavored over any other members. We define ""favor"" as an unfair benefit that is not a direct consequence of provable effort and actions done, in alignment with our mission and goals. We define ""disfavor"" as an unfair punishment or loss of opportunity that is not a direct consequence of provable actions done against Evmos’ mission and goals.

**3. User-Centrism:** Evmos is specialized to provide a unique EVM experience in the Cosmos ecosystem. We must therefore continue to optimize for 1) user adoption and 2) the qualities that contribute to steady growth: network liquidity, improvement of user experience, data sovereignty, stable production of blocks, educational resources, strong governance, etc.

**4. Agnosticism:** Evmos should maintain neutrality as a chain with roots in both the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. While the governance of Evmos may be reliant from time to time on other networks or tools, the Evmos community should retain a stance of neutrality. Community members must leave tribalism at the door; we should refrain from engaging in political debates that are not directly relevant to improving the Evmos network.

**5. Cross-Chain Diplomacy:** Evmos is a network with a long history in the decentralization movement, with inspirations, ideas, protocols, and allies in various networks. Our community will come from a wide range of blockchain communities. Cross-chain collaborations, outreach initiatives, diplomacy missions, and continued participation in events are highly encouraged — especially with chains from the EVM and IBC ecosystems.

**6. Consensual Collaboration:** While the Cosmos SDK’s implementation of governance is relatively permissionless, this does not mean anyone is entitled to work or compensation. Proposals will be assessed by the community on their merits alone and eventually voted on. In addition, proposals must follow the Governance Framework of the Evmos network and adhere to the principles outlined in the Constitution.

**7. Sovereignty to Work:** The purpose of the Governance Framework is not to micro-manage proposals or teams. Sovereignty will be given to those that are working in accordance with the original proposal passed by the community, and are not in violation of any governance processes or principles of the Constitution.

## 4. Removal of Community Leaders

All community members appointed to a role of higher responsibility, including workstream members, may be removed via a formal vote on-chain. The Governance Framework shall outline the appointment, removal, and appeals process, along with a detailed dispute resolution guideline.

## 5. Constitutional Rights

The Governance workstream shall amend a Bill of Rights to the Constitution as soon as a general consensus can be confidently reached.

## 6. Constitutional Amendments and Revisions

The community holds the power to propose an amendment to the Constitution by following the standard Evmos Proposal Lifecycle. The reasoning for the amendment must be justified and petitioned. If possible, there should be an attempt made to resolve the issue before a proposal for amendment is initiated.

**Validator/Community Code of Conduct and Constitutional Rights**

We recognize that this Constitution is missing a few key topics — however, we also see the need to tread carefully in these sensitive and controversial topics. While it is inarguable that these are necessary components of the Constitution, there was clear signaling that we needed more time to allow for the natural growth of the community before we could formally ratify some sections with confidence. We pledge to continue our research and continue to engage with the community to find general consensus on the best step forward. While some topics will be amended into the Constitution when they are ready, most will likely be implemented through the Governance Framework.

# Your Votes... 

**By voting YES**, you are signing the Constitution to be ratified so that the Governance workstream can shift focus and begin introducing components of the the Governance Framework that will allow for the creation of more  workstreams and special growth projects / committees / teams. Voting YES does not necessarily mean that you are fully content — but you will allow it.

**By voting ABSTAIN**, you are signaling that you did not read the Constitution or do not understand its content or its purpose.

**By voting NO**, you refuse to accept the Constitution at its current state.

**By voting NO WITH VETO**, you are showing complete opposition to the Constitution and would rather leave the community than to have it ratified at its current state.",0.0028275340276851337
"Fund DIA Randomness Oracle Gas Fees for 1 Year

Full discussion: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6662-ideation-fund-dia-randomness-orcale-gas-fees-for-1-year 
 Hi All, 
 0xCtrlAltApe here from the Orbital Apes team. I am starting this discussion to help launch DIA Randomness Oracles on Evmos. I am not affiliated with the DIA team in anyway.
 DIA provides an on-chain randomness oracle solution for EVM chains. If deployed the randomness oracle can be used by any smart contract on Evmos. While the DIA team does not charge for oracle usage, they do ask that gas fees to maintain the oracle are provided to launch on a new chain. By the DIA teams estimations this would be roughly 44 evmos/day which equals to 16060 Evmos for the year.
 Randomness oracles will allow for more innovative and new types of applications to be built on Evmos. Currently there are no options available for randomness on-chain on Evmos. As this oracle can be used for free by any dev/team on Evmos after deployment I believe that covering gas fees is an appropriate use of community funds.
 Funds will be sent to a (2/3) multisig managed by:
 0xCtrlAltApe (Orbital Apes team member)
 Liam (Evmos team member)
 Samuel Brack (DIA team member)
 These funds can be sent to the DIA team on a monthly basis to cover gas costs for the randomness oracle. The fees earned from the fee-spilt module in Evmos v8 will be used to continue funding the oracle gas fees.",0.08785874023082811

"Covalent API's Integration of Evmos and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon

## Summary

This proposal is the second iteration of the original proposal posted on Commonwealth on the 19th of July.  We are seeking community funding for our previous work as well as future efforts in indexing the Evmos network for the Covalent Unified API, along with the launch of the Evmos-Covalent Joint *#OneMillionWallets* Hackathon

 - **Covalent will continue to index the Evmos network and receive a compensation of 100K USD, which will be staked entirely and delegated to lower validators.**
 - **Covalent will run a joint hackathon with Evmos to onboard more developers, and explore and kickstart novel use cases for the Evmos ecosystem with a prize pool of $100K.**
 - **The total ask is $200K in Evmos tokens - The amount of tokens for the hackathon prizes of $100k will be determined at time of dispersement. In the case of extreme price volatility, the Governance workstream will assist in readjusting the community pool funding request.** 


Note: Because of the character limit of Cosmos SDK's governance module, some portions of the proposal have been left out and the proposal has been modified for on-chain submission with the help of the Evmos DAO Governance Workstream. View the full proposal on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6603-prevote-covalent-apis-integration-of-evmos-and-joint-hackathon). 

## Background

At Covalent, we believe blockchain technologies can change the world, but this potential is left unfulfilled if the data is not accessible. Despite the proliferation of on-chain digital assets, current solutions require developers to spend hours writing additional code to query granular blockchain data.

Covalent is the only multi-chain API that provides every single point of on-chain data - directly from the browser. With no extra code, you need just one API call to query any piece of data across +40 blockchains.

 - +40 blockchains indexed, including  Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB, Ethereum, Evmos, Fantom, Harmony, Ronin, Moonbeam & Polygon
 - +30K developers, and
 - +3K live projects, including 0x, Aave, CoinGecko, ConsenSys, DappRadar, NFTX, ParaSwap, Sovryn, Uniswap, XDEFI Wallet & Zerion
 - +2.5M calls made to Evmos using Covalent's Unified API

**Evmos API Call Volume Growth (Month over Month)**

- June 2022 -- 2M / +312%
 - May 2022 -- 500K / +170,489%
 - April 2022 -- 282 / +14,000%
 - March 2022 -- 2

Covalent's vision is to empower the pioneers of tomorrow by providing the most robust data infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem, delivering complete transparency and visibility to all on-chain digital assets.

## API Endpoints for Evmos

- Class A endpoints - These return enriched blockchain data applicable to all blockchain networks
 - Class B endpoints - These are for a specific protocol on a blockchain
 - Class C endpoints - This will be a community-driven market where users can create API endpoints for their projects
 - DEX & NFT marketplace data (i.e., EvmoSwap, Diffusion) & more to be integrated as the number of protocols grow. 
 - Covalent will be indexing the entirety of Evmos' on-chain data

More details about our API can be found in [Evmos | Covalent Docs](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/evmos/) 

## Timeline

**The indexing of Evmos has already been completed and the completion was publicly announced on 30 May 2022. The indexing of Evmos is currently live, and freely available for developers.**

- 30 May - 15 August 2022 -- A proposal to index Evmos is floated in the Evmos governance forum.
 - 22 September 2022 -- The joint hackathon registration goes live.
 - 22 October 2022 -- The Joint '#OneMillionWallets' Hackathon begins.

## Deliverables

Pre-integration and Post-integration deliverables can be viewed in the [full proposal here](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6603-prevote-covalent-apis-integration-of-evmos-and-joint-hackathon). 

## Funding & Disbursement

The EVMOS/USD exchange rate for the disbursements is to be determined according to the exchange rate at which the disbursements are made. 

- API and Indexing: 100K USD of Evmos  tokens will be released upon the passing of the proposal. **Covalent will stake the compensation and delegate it to lower validators** for up to one year. 
 - #OneMillionWallets Hackathon: Roughly $100K in Evmos will be used to host the joint hackathon. 

 The funds will be released initially to a 3 of 4-person multisig wallet with the following signatories: 
 - Leibing, Dev Relations @ Covalent 
 - Daniel, Data Journalist @ Covalent 
 - LPX, Evmos DAO Governance 
 - Benny Lava, Evmos DAO & Community Mod

**Multisig deployment address:** 0x05a6991caD6B2258Bc5c7FE2b0793Af93590DbD0

Covalent has an impressive track record of successful hackathons for Layer-1 networks.

"Evmos Mainnet v8.1.0 Upgrade

## Author

Daniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team

## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal

If successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos software upgrade at block height [4,655,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/4655500) from it's current version [v7.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v7.0.0) to [v8.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).

## Motivation

By proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).

## Impact

On a high level, the v8.1.0 software includes the following improvements:

* [Feesplit module](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/feesplit/): Developers can register their smart contracts and earn rewards everytime someone interacts with their registered smart contract
* Upgrade to Ethermint [v0.19.2](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.19.2): Improves JSON-RPC reliability and maintainability and bumps SDK, Tendermint and IAVL dependencies and adds supports for optional params on EIP712
* Upgrade ibc-go to [v3.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.45.7]

A full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).

## Testing

Prior to this proposal the version v8.1.0 is been upgraded to and tested on the [Evmos Testnet](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/72).

Additionally, the Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md).

## Discussion

Before voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6653-evmos-software-upgrade-v810).",0.0001299341503651815

"Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development, Addressed from The Evmos Community to The Kava Community

# Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development, Addressed from The Evmos Community to The Kava Community

This is an inter-chain diplomacy proposal for the Evmos Community to ask the Kava Community to reward [Ethermint past development efforts](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/graphs/contributors) (done until September 1st 2022), with 2.5M (2,500,000) EVMOS.

$Kava tokens will be used to buy $EVMOS.
On Evmos, the 2.5M $EVMOS will be used for Ethermint development, following a similar procedure to Evmos Grants:
- stake the $EVMOS to active validators that have under 0.66% voting power, to improve Evmos's Nakamoto Coefficient
- fund Ethermint development from staking rewards

Multisig on Evmos: 0xd04DB421f518D0E3449D2A3cefEac25b31485c71
- Mr.Sir | Orbital Apes
- InstaFinanzas | Stakin
- LPX | Evmos Governance
- arda | Validator.run
- luisqa | OzMage Validation

Multisig on Kava will be created with the same composition if this proposal will pass.

## Summary of Facts

- [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/graphs/contributors) is a Go module that bridges the Cosmos APIs (Cosmos SDK, Tendermint, IBC, etc) to EVM (using the [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) library as module). It is the de-facto way to have EVM-powered Cosmos chains.
- Ethermint's is developed and maintained by Tharsis & other contributors & volunteers.
- [Kava](https://www.kava.io/) is ""One Network. Two Chains. Ethereum and Cosmos.""
- Kava is today valued at ~$400M market cap
- Estimated total value locked: ~$140M
- Initial investment in building and marketing Kava is less than $1M
- ""Kava Rise Program: $750M Developer Incentive Program. The structure of the Rise program will focus primarily on driving adoption and growth for the new Ethereum Co-Chain.""
- Kava Community Pool has ~80M KAVA tokens
- Kava uses Ethermint for their Ethereum Co-Chain and Cosmos SDK for Cosmos in [their code](https://github.com/Kava-Labs)
- Tharsis made [this Commonwealth proposal](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6684-external-evm-infrastructure-funding-proposal-on-kava) to the Evmos and Kava communities, ""requesting 3M out of ~80M KAVA tokens (3.7%) from the Kava Community Pool Treasury to fund, develop and advance critical EVM Infrastructure through the Ethermint Engineering and R&D team for 1 year."", followed by opening a [Kava Community Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/wsa37v/evm_infrastructure_funding_proposal_on_kava/). Resulting in the formal [on-chain Kava proposal #96](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/96)
- Proposal #96 was rejected. 13/21 of the top validators votes YES, 1/21 voted ABSTAIN, and 7/21 did not vote. The top 21 validators have 88.90% voting power. Kava's co-founder & CEO's [response](https://twitter.com/Scott_Stuart_/status/1563228443436728321).
- Kava Labs made its own ""Kava Infrastructure Security rewards"" [proposal #97](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/97), with no mention of funding Ethermint, as critical infrastructure. With no link to any Kava Community discussion. This proposal passed.
- ""The Kava DAO is a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Kava Network. Made up of the Kava stakers and validators that help to secure and run the network""
- Kava did not make any concrete offers to reward past development efforts for Ethermint

## Why the Evmos Community has standing?

- Evmos uses Ethermint as core infrastructure
- Tharsis has most funds from the $EVMOS coin growth, so the Evmos chain became the de-facto treasurer for Tharsis
- The Evmos Community are the guardians of Evmos interests, which include Ethermint and the well-being of Tharsis devs

## Inter-Chain Diplomacy

Right now, Ethermint tech is an exportable product from the Evmos chain to all other chains that do not make development effort towards it (but use it), therefore the payment should be in $EVMOS.

The Evmos community now has the standing to make a funding proposal in the name of Tharsis, in $EVMOS, first on the Evmos governance, then on Kava.

Given that the Kava Community rejected the request for funding Ethermint's future development, for 1 year, we propose that another funding request should be made to Kava by the Evmos Community, for past development efforts, that have already taken place and have already brought value to Kava. Any other future funding requests will be discussed separately.

Off-chain polls & discussion for price discovery were opened in [Evmos Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6867-external-ethermint-funding-proposal-on-kava-price-discovery-vote).

## What will Kava stand to gain?

Ethermint will enter the most technically interesting phase: custom precompiles and EVM-Inter-Chain. Working prototypes already exist and were presented https://youtu.be/x75UobIr4qo?t=14670 and the ground work for Ethermint was set with https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/pull/1272.

(proposal lead:) I have personally developed the Go groundwork for inter-chain cooperation and deployed three public technical blockchains with EVM-Cosmos (Mythos, Ethos, and Logos), for demoing the inter-chain tech and I will re-base my work on the Ethermint extensibility of EVM precompiles.
Some precompiles that I created that are pertinent to this:
- abstract accounts (implementing account abstraction for EVM https://hackmd.io/@matt/r1neQ_B38)
- quasar: ability to run Cosmos transactions from EVM
- IBC precompile for EVM
- nBridge: n-way (n>=2) generalized bridge by transaction replay
(Demos at: https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos)

Next generation protocols are inter-chain. If Kava rewards past Ethermint development efforts, and demonstrates will to collaborate, it has a chance to be invited to benefit from the EVM-Inter-Chain innovations. This is no longer Ethermint, it is next-generation Ethermint (with extensions) and licensing may be subjected to change if context requires it.
We hope the Kava Community will not choose the short-term frugality over long-term greater benefits. Especially that this is an ethical opportunity that benefits Kava as image, Evmos, and the whole Cosmos.


## Why should the Cosmos Community care?

1. Blockchains are entities with communities. So, we need to have rules for behaving between chains. The proposal is bringing clarity to what is civil between chains (in this case, pertaining to funding previous dev efforts). Rejecting a proposal from Tharsis is different than rejecting a proposal from the Evmos Community. Kava and Evmos are part of the larger Cosmos Inter-Chain ecosystem.
2. This proposal's purpose is to find a general way to determine a fair ask for any other chains, not only Kava.
3. Ethermint is a core piece of infrastructure that brings value to Cosmos. The Cosmos Community should fight to keep it open-source and well-developed.
4. Fairly rewarding effort made to evolve Cosmos is critical to inter-chain cooperation.
5. Upholding the values of decentralized governance in each chain is a critical requirement for any inter-chain cooperation.


## Votes

If you vote YES: This proposal will be posted on Kava's subreddit, for Kava Community feedback. And then, as an on-chain proposal to the Kava Community.


## Proposal Lead

This proposal was led on behalf of the Evmos Community, by Loredana Cirstea - elected by vote in the Evmos Interchain Office (Evmos Governance proposal #45) and a volunteer from The Laurel Project (https://evolve.provable.dev/). This proposal is made from a volunteer capacity (independent, unpaid, self-funded, and from the heart).

"Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program

## Summary 

This proposal, also known as [""Kickstart DeFi on Evmos""](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6977-prevote-kickstart-defi-on-evmos) from Commonwealth, will begin the Evmos DAO Liquidity Incentives Program with the bootstrapping of liquidity pools on the Diffusion DEX. More initiatives are in the works with other DeFi projects, and will be proposed when ready.

## Motivation 

The Evmos blockchain has the potential to become a unique environment for DeFi in the IBC ecosystem, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth. We have also had very attractive staking APR that gave a higher return than most liquidity pools, and a bridge exploit that destroyed the TVL of Evmos DeFi in a matter of hours.

Despite the hurdles, we are confident in saying that we had great success with our incentivization initiative for the EVMOS/OSMO pool through Prop 39 which provided 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days on the Osmosis DEX. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis in nearly all areas including TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 5th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $9.8M and one of the highest volume pools of over $3M. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring soon, and while we do plan on extending the Osmosis program, we must also begin looking inward: our native TVL.

## Strategy 

As more EVMOS tokens are staked, the APR rates have been decreasing at an accelerated rate. Millions of tokens are being unbonded at this moment, and without alternative pools with very appealing rates, they will most likely be going to Osmosis to be sold. Our first priority is to 1) build the much needed liquidity to wean off our reliance on Osmosis pools for liquid markets; 2) attract fellow IBC friends to participate in our high rewards programs and attract the unbonding Evmos tokens to find its way into these incentivized pools.

The Community Treasury is currently sitting around 33mil EVMOS tokens with 75mil+ EVMOS tokens returning from the unclaimed airdrops, and with an usage incentives escrow wallet which is now nearing 35mil tokens.

In total, roughly 143mil EVMOS (~$357mil @ $2.5), is left sitting with no benefits, when they can be put to strategic use that not only encourages more network participants, but also brings the community rewards for helping with the bootstrap initiative.

In summary, this is an aggressive but needed first step in further growing the Evmos network. Liam from Evmos explains eloquently in [this comment](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6977-prevote-kickstart-defi-on-evmos?comment=30063) why this proposal is so important. We highly suggest reading the comment for context.

 ## Plan of Action 

Diffusion will be the first DEX to receive incentives, as they have been the leading DEX prior to the Nomad exploit. More protocols and DeFi projects will follow, with programs of their own.

Diffusion will continue with their DIFF rewards for existing pools, resulting in *double rewards* for the pools that will be incentivized further with Evmos tokens.

2mil EVMOS tokens will be released into a Gnosis Safe (3/5 signatures). Over the course of 90 days, the allocated EVMOS rewards will be released into Diffusion's staking contract (MiniChefv2 & Audited). We are initially aiming to minimize risk by releasing the funds every two weeks allowing time for assessments, and if needed, the re-balancing of rewards for underperforming pools. 

The multisig will be managed by: 

- 3 Evmos DAO Governance members (Benny Lava, Tricky, LPX)
- 1 Diffusion team member (mercenaryApe)
- 1 Validator (Swiss Staking)

## Incentives Allocations 

The EVMOS incentives will go towards attracting liquidity for EVMOS pairs with ATOM, WETH, WBTC, OSMO, JUNO, DIFF, and USDC pools. The EVMOS token incentive breakdown for those pools would be as follows:

**Category: Major (50%)**

- EVMOS / ATOM - 400k 
- EVMOS / wETH - 400k (200k each Axelar, Celer) 
- EVMOS / wBTC - 200k (66.7K each Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Celer)

**Category: Stablecoins (35%)**

- EVMOS / Stablecoins - 700k (USDC split evenly between Axelar and Celer -- USDT and DAI for Gravity Bridge)

**Category: Minor (15%)**

- EVMOS / OSMO - 100k 
- EVMOS / JUNO - 100k 
- EVMOS / DIFF - 100k 

For the kickoff program, we propose the equal distribution of incentives between the bridged assets **with the exception of gUSDC and gWETH pools**, as they are already being incentivized and are locked into smart contracts for the time being. This distribution will take course over a 90 day period.

**Rebalancing of Pool Allocations** - Over the first 14 days funds will be split evenly between pools in each category, followed by distribution proportionate to each pool's TVL & Volume accordingly. 50% of the category incentives based upon TVL, and 50% based upon volume to fairly distribute incentives to the most valuable pools.

Rough TVL and APR targets per pool: [Graphical Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16395727/192321522-df012984-1edf-4a39-b9df-b3d959a532c5.png) 

## Future Plans 

Future proposals can use this data to gauge their own bridge incentives. This will help the most desired liquidity continue to come onto Evmos and maintain attractive APRs while doing so. We are currently aiming to hit a TVL of $20mil on Evmos by the end of the year (across the entire network).

2mil EVMOS is less than 1.5% of our available funds, and covers an entire DEX including interchain assets on Evmos. When compared to the 0.5% spent for a single EVMOS/OSMO pool, we firmly believe that this kickoff initiative is reasonable. We are currently working on a standardized framework in which these processes can be streamlined and more transparent; we thank the community for your patience and thank you to all those that have participated in the discussion stage of the proposal.

**About Diffusion:**

Diffusion is the a Uniswap v2 fork with Sushi's MinichefV2 implemented for rewards distribution. Diffusion was the first DEX and by far the largest in TVL and volume before the Nomad hack. With stablecoins back on Evmos and incentives to give them a boost, the revitalized team will soon be releasing a new roadmap and their plans to continually improve the DEX.

"Liquidity Mining Proposal for Axelar Network, Celer Network, and Gravity Bridge on Kinesis

This proposal incentivizes stablecoin liquidity as bridge from Axelar, Celer, and Gravity Bridge with 99000 Evmos to be linearly distributed over 2 months. In the past, Kinesis Labs has reached over 459k USD worth of stablecoins in TVL without any incentives, with over 11,000 transactions and 400 unique liquidity providers. However, with the recent Nomad hack, Evmos needs a way to boostrap liquidity to jump start the Evmos DeFi ecosystem. Please note that all of these funds will be distributed to liquidity providers on Kinesis through the minichef contract - these funds are not for the Kinesis Team nor anyone else. Additionally, we are building Kinesis as members of the Evmos community as a public good. We do not take any fees.

"Extending Osmosis External Incentives

## INCUBATION PROPOSAL

 **Summary**

This proposal aims to extend the external EVMOS incentives for the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis. 600,000 EVMOS will be distributed to 14 day bonding only over 90 days. The total ask is for 600,100 EVMOS to also cover the external incentives gauge fees. The funds will be sent to a 3/4 multisig upon approval to deploy the incentives on Osmosis. You can find the commonwealth discussion here: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7102-temperature-check-extending-osmosis-external-incentives](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7102-temperature-check-extending-osmosis-external-incentives)

 **Motivation**

We have had great success with incentivizing the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis through Prop 39 and providing 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis through TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 6th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $7.3M (Peaking at $10M) and 3rd highest 7-day volume of $6.5M. The number of tokens locked in the LP have grown from 700k EVMOS before the incentives started to now just over 2M. Deep & stable liquidity is important for the health of every protocol, and incentives can play a key part in maintaining this liquidity. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring on October 18th, so the community needs to decide the next steps forward.

 **Plan of Action**

 Based on poll results and community feedback in Discord and Commonwealth, we are asking to extend incentives on Osmosis with another 600k EVMOS over 90 days. Osmosis is the gateway for new users into the Cosmos ecosystem so it is important to maintain deep liquidity. Once this period is over, we can reevaluate the incentives as we will have a clearer picture with how native liquidity has grown.

600k EVMOS over a 90 day period (6,666.67 EVMOS per day), 100 EVMOS for funding Osmosis gauge creation and filling.

TOTAL : 600,100 EVMOS

14 day bond only

Pool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO)

"Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff

## Author
GV | Swiss Staking ([@swiss_staking](https://twitter.com/swiss_staking))
## Intro 
The [Diffusion](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/64) incentives will start soon. As you might know, some incentivized pools require to bridge assets from Ethereum via Axelar/Gravity to Evmos. Once they are bridged to Evmos, you must convert them (on the [asset page](https://app.evmos.org/assets) of Evmos) from IBC-coins to ERC-20 tokens. This requires a fee of about ~0.3 Evmos. New ecosystem participants won’t own any Evmos at this time, so it is crucial to implement a faucet who funds them. This situation is only temporary, as the team will implement an auto-conversion on protocol level in the near future. Until then, it’s our job to onboard new participants with ease to unleash the full potential of the DeFi revival on Evmos.
## Architecture 
The bot will be available on the Discord faucet channel of Evmos. To minimize any gaming of the faucet we will implement a cooldown period, a minimum number of assets that must be deposited on the [asset page](https://app.evmos.org/assets) and further on-chain checks. The bot's wallet will be funded by the multisig on a bi-weekly basis (or if the balance gets close to zero). Furthermore, we might fund additional hot-wallets for faucet purposes.
## Funds 
Onboarding 20,000 users is a likely scenario thus we ask for 6,000 Evmos to be used for dust. Unused Evmos will be returned within 6 months. Code refactoring, integration and management of the bot is volunteer effort.

"Evmos Mainnet v9.1.0 Upgrade

## Author

Freddy Caceres ([@FaCs95](https://twitter.com/FaCs95)), Evmos Core Team

## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal

If successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos software upgrade at block height [6,654,000](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/6654000) from it's current version [v8.2.3](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.2.3) to [v9.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v9.1.0) on the Evmos Mainnet. 

## Motivation

 Software upgrades generally aim to improve current perfomance and add new features on the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).

## Impact

The purpose of this release is to return funds to the affected accounts during the claims records clawback of block 5074187. This process will be done through the upgrade handler. This will have to be a coordinated (breaking) upgrade since the state will be modified.

The list of affected accounts can be found at app/upgrades/v9_1/accounts.go with their respective balance. The scripts used to find affected accounts were made public at [claims_fixer's](https://github.com/evmos/claims_fixer) repo with detailed instructions on how to run them and reproduce the same result.

NOTE: The return of funds to affected accounts is only relevant to Mainnet.

A full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v9.1.0).

## Testing

The Evmos core team created a End-to-End testing suite that perfoms the software upgrade locally. These tests have been performed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md).",0.00031539764321960223

"Dystopia Labs - Evmos Developer Acquisition Grant Request

**Summary**

Dystopia Labs is requesting $75k (60,000 EVMOS at time of writing) from the Evmos community to support 5 IRL events for $15k each, totaling to $75k in 2023:

- ETH Portland (Jan 2023)
- DeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)
- ETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)
- ETH Seattle (July 2023)
- ETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)

**Abstract**

Who Are We:

Dear Evmos Community,
I'm Hsin-Ju, founder & CEO of Dystopia Labs [http://dystopialabs.com](http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH.Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we’ve hosted 449+ workshops and 18 summits with reach in 19+ countries. With over 32,000+ registrants for our events, we’ve built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, & more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.

Why Our Proposal Matters:

Since Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there’s a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.

Dystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming 5 IRL events in 2023:

• ETH Portland (Jan 2023)
• DeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)
• ETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)
• ETH Seattle (July 2023)
• ETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)

**Funding Request**

We are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $75k in 2023. This will help cover venue costs, AV, staging, furniture, and food.
We expect 300-350 attendees per event and about 800-1000 registrants (Evmos will get the email list). And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we’d love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.
To us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.
In the past, we’ve had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot’s team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.
Other sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.

**WHY THE CONFERENCES ARE VALUABLE TO EVMOS:**

Beyond brand recognition and on-site education, the email list is the highest value thing a sponsor can get out of any event. As part of our sponsorship agreement, Evmos would get the email list of all the conference attendees per event. This is a huge value add because the Evmos team can reach out to the attendees (who listened to the Evmos talk IRL) and drive them to more dense educational content (ie. like videos, blog posts, documentation, etc) after the event. They can even use these lists to even create their own event series (if they so wished). Over time, as they participate in more and more events, Evmos will be able to convert people who they met IRL into advocates (simply b/c they are able to reach attendees after the event and to continue pushing them down the funnel). TLDR; registrant lists will be a huge value add for the Evmos community.

We’re Part Of The Ecosystem:
Our goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor. We have also not sold ANY of the $EVMOS tokens that we've received. We're in it for the long haul :) In 2022, EVMOS participated in 2 of our events, HackSummit SF & DeFi Bogota. As a summary, here are the key stats for the 2 events Evmos participated in:

For DeFi Bogota: [(https://2022.defibogota.org/](https://2022.defibogota.org/)
• 100% free for attendees
• 2024 registrants (Evmos will get the email list)
• ~700 attendees
• 20 speakers
• 21 sessions
• 18 talks
• 1 panel
• 2 workshops
• 7 hrs of content

For Hacksummit SF: [https://sf.hacksummit.org](https://sf.hacksummit.org/)
• 100% free for attendees
• 916 registrants (Evmos will get the email list)
• ~350 attendees
• 30 sessions
• 24 talks

"[ECP-1] Formalizing the Foundational Layer of Evmos DAO Governance

**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council

**Notice:** This proposal submission has been significantly shortened to fit within the proposal word count and accompanying graphical content has been removed - we highly recommend reading the full version on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md).

**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified Guiding Values. Each proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. After a month of deliberation and productive discussions on Commonwealth, we feel confident to move forward.

The scope of this vote is to formalize ECP-1, which includes two submodules:
- ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework
- ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework
---
The rest of the following proposals will be presented to the community very shortly:

- ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council
- ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream
- ECP-3: Empowering the Community with Strategic Growth Initiatives*
- ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*
---
**ECP-2A will be submitted for voting later tonight, with ECP-2B to follow within the week.**
**ECP-3 and ECP-4 will be finalized and proposed in Q1 2023, but the proposal drafts are available for preview on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions/2.%20Evmos%20DAO%20Proposals) as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-3.md).**

**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos core team is becoming harder to manage.

The urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years.
## ECP-1A: Evmos Community Proposal Framework
**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework. All community proposals must go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the framework before going on-chain for voting.

**Abstract:** ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAOs Governance system, and provides a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams. The Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.

## ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework 

**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively.

**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in scaling a DAO and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations. One of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. Please refer to full proposal for our vision for workstreams.
### 1. Definition and Purpose 
Workstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc). A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community run initiatives.
### 2. Workstream Requirements 
Anyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered informal. A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the various creation.
### 3. Workstream Formation Process
### 4. Workstream Stages

## The Standardized Compensation Framework
Our goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.
**Compensation Principles, Compensation Types, Compensation Eligibility** can be found in the full document.

When a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:
- The role the contributor plays
- The weekly time commitment 
- The monthly compensation amount 
- Compensation rationale (base and vested) 

Community ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members. This framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO. 

## Base Compensation
**Base Compensation Parameters**

**1 | Value Level** - refers to the contributors expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributors level. Value Level Assessment Matrix - Please refer to the full proposal.

**2 | Commitment Level** - The DAO will cap time full-time commitments to 40 hour work weeks for a total of 160 hours / month. Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders.

Commitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)

Example scenarios: refer to the full proposal.

**3 | Base Rate** - The base rate is currently proposed at $28/hr. The Community may vote to adjust the hourly rate through a governance proposal to account for changes in market conditions and/or treasury reserve levels. 

**Calculating Base Compensation**:
 `Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`
## Vesting Compensation
**Vesting Compensation Parameters**

**1 | Contribution Level** - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).

The Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members.

Refer to full prop for more details.

**2 | Accountability Level** - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2. 

Please refer to the full proposal to view the accountability level table.

**Calculating Vesting Compensation**:
`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`

Vesting schedules for all contracts are 4-years.

 **Short Intro:** 
 MetaTank is creating a gameverse (think MCU but for games) around its IP. Focusing on building web2 mobile games (hypercasual genre) and connecting them to web3 via our Conversion Platform. Lore-based games that are stream-friendly (prone to virality) and fun. Users can simply download our games from an app store and play. However, the option exists for users to convert their in-game rewards into on-chain $MTNK tokens on the Evmos blockchain.
 **Important:** We are not a Metaverse, no NFTs are involved, no tokens required to play, and we are not P2E. MetaTank is creating games that are price-independent. Focusing on strategically increasing our IP value through the mass appeal of hypercasual mobile games.
 **Why we are unique:** We are bringing a new method of revenue generation and user acquisition not seen in crypto. Built on quality production and not reliant on marketing hype, token prices or a constant funnel of new users (new capital).
 **Business Model:** MetaTank generates fiat revenue externally via In-App Ads and In-App Purchases. A portion is injected into Evmos to balance the rewards liquidity pool. The remainder is reinvested into game development. Further adding to our library of mobile games which leads to more users and increased recurring revenues.
 **Bringing Value to Evmos:** MetaTank has found a less-exhausting method to onboard web2 users. Only via Evmos can the Conversion Platform be utilized. Users will become natives and have a stake in Evmos’ growth.  They will be holding a portion of their wealth on Evmos. They will support local projects and engage in other activities such as trading, minting, liquidity mining and lending. Long-term stakeholders who will not disappear after a retweet competition or incentive program.
 
 **Initial benefits to Evmos include:** 
 - Benefit 1 – Liquidity injected into Evmos from revenues generated externally (Ads/In-app purchases).
 - Benefit 2 – Onboarding web2 users, who must enter Evmos to use our Conversion Platform.
 - Benefit 3 - Onboarding Web2 game developers with already established userbases and IP (compounding Benefit 1 & 2).
 - Benefit 4 – 10% of MetaTank tokens are reserved for the Evmos community.
 - Benefit 5 – Conducting the MetaTank amassed userbase as a marketing platform, promoting Evmos and its ecosystem projects. 
 
 This is not a one-time deal. MetaTank wishes to continue its relationship with the Evmos community, sharing in the value generated by its IP. Our materials prove that we are capable and have already built a version of everything we propose.
 **[Proof of capability >](https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1605249619713490944)** 
 The mobile gaming industry is experiencing non-stop growth. We can do a lot more with Evmos and show the world of web2 and web3 that there is another way to gaming in crypto.",0.15221056682234055
"Evmos Mainnet v10.0.0 Upgrade

## Description

### Author

Daniel Burckhardt, Evmos Core Team

### Software upgrade being scheduled with this proposal

If successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos Mainnet software upgrade at block height [9,495,000](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/9495000) from its current version [v9.1.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v9.1.0) to [v10.0.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v10.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.

### Motivation

By proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on Testnet and then on Mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).

### Impact

On a high level, the v10.0.0 software includes the following improvements:

- Update Cosmos-SDK to v0.46.7, IBC-Go to v5.2.0 and Ethermint to v0.20.0
- Automatic conversion of IBC coins to their ERC20 representation upon receiving
- Support for ERC20 token transfers via IBC
- ERC20 proposals to register ERC20 tokens and Cosmos coins now can receive multiple denominations
- Prioritized mempool support for Cosmos and Ethereum txs
- EIP-1559 support for native Cosmos transactions
- EIP-712 fixes for all major Cosmos messages (eg: MsgGrant for restake support)
- Add Ledger support to the evmosd CLI
- Ethereum Tx indexer
- The funder for a clawback vesting account can now be updated
- Introduce minimum commission rate as governance ruled parameter for the staking module (set at 5%)
- EIP-712 fixes for the vesting module
- Add a default file store listener for a basic implementation of [ADR-038: State Listening](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/architecture/adr-038-state-listening)
- Update default node snapshot interval to 5000 seconds
- Update Ledger supported algorithms to only consist of EthSecp256k1

A full change log can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v10.0.0).

NOTE: Since Cosmos v0.46 it is not possible to include links to Windows binaries in software upgrade proposals anymore.

### Testing

The Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.

  This passing of this proposal would raise the minimum amount of EVMOS tokens to be deposited for a proposal to reach on-chain voting from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS with the intentions to maintain high quality proposals and prevent spam from going on chain.
 
 ### Abstract
 
  Proposal Deposit Concept: 
  
 * For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be reach a set deposit of an amount defined by parameters in the governance module before the deposit end time.
 
  * A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.
  The proposer account is only required to deposit ~**1 EVMOS**. 
 
  Deposit Refund and Burn Concept: 
 
  * If the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount. 
 
  * If the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4%) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.
 
  ### Motivation 
 
  Proposal to Increase Deposit Amount: 
 
  By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit requires 192 EVMOS or approximately 60 in USD equivalent. Currently, is a low threshold to help ensure quality proposals and prevent possible spam proposals. Comparing other cosmos governance current deposits, the Cosmos hub requires 250 ATOM or 2,280 USD and Osmosis requires 1600 OSMO or 1,193 USD for proposals to enter the on-chain voting stage. 
 
  With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to 3500 EVMOS or approximately 1,100 in USD equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance. 
 
  ### Important Note: 
 
  Community Members must not be priced out of making proposals on chain. 3500 EVMOS is likely a large enough deposit to deter spam, whilst still being within the reach of most community members to campaign for a deposit, or provide one themselves. 
 
  Multiple wallets may fund any proposal deposit, so this remains within the realm of most Cosmos users to campaign for and crowdsource funding from other community members and validators, where a good proposal may exist, but funding for a deposit is lacking. 
 
  ### Voting 
 
  * By voting YES, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS. 
 
  * By voting NO, you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements. 
 
  * By voting ABSTAIN, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal. 
 
  * By voting NOWITHVETO, expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",0.0071876338984588894
"Ratify Governance-Official Meanings for Yes, No, Abstain and NoWithVeto

## Ratify Governance-Official Meanings for Yes, No, Abstain and NoWithVeto 
 
 ### Summary 
 
 This proposal aims to put forward a clear definition for the voting options “Yes”, “No”, “Abstain”, and “NoWithVeto” in Evmos governance that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community. These definitions are taken directly from the Evmos docs, and will be further formalized if this proposal passes.  
 
 * Yes: indicates approval of the proposal in its current form. 
 * No: indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. 
 * Abstain: indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal. 
* NoWithVeto: indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned. 
 
### Abstract 
 
 Recently, there have been proposals that have attempted to redefine the meanings of the voting options in a governance process. This is a dangerous precedent to set because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters, which can in turn undermine the will of the voters. To ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the views of the community, it is crucial to clearly define the meanings of the voting options and design the governance process in a way that promotes fairness and effectiveness. 
 
### Motivation 
 
In Evmos governance a “No” vote is generally understood to mean that the voter is opposed to the proposal and does not want it to be implemented. An “Abstain” vote means that the voter is neutral on the proposal and does not wish to express a position either for or against it. A “No With Veto” vote means the voter is strongly opposed and in most cases will lead to the proposal deposit being burned. 
 
 It can be dangerous to add or change meanings to the voting options in a governance process because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters. Additionally, changing meanings to the voting options can undermine the transparency and fairness of the governance process. If voters do not understand the full implications of their votes, they may make decisions that are not in line with their true views or the best interests of the community. This can undermine the legitimacy of the governance process and lead to mistrust and dissatisfaction among the community. 
 
Overall, it is important to clearly define the meanings of the various voting options in a governance process to ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the will of the community. 
 
The passage of this proposal will ratify following definitions directly from the Evmos docs that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community: 
 
* Yes: indicates approval of the proposal in its current form. 
* No: indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. 
* Abstain: indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal. 
* NoWithVeto: indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned. 
 
 ### Voting 
 
* By voting YES, indicates approval of the proposal in its current form to ratify the governance-official meanings of  “Yes”,“No”, “Abstain” and “No With Veto” for governance voting options. 
 
* By voting NO,  indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. 
 
* By voting ABSTAIN, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal. 
 
* By voting NOWITHVETO, indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.

"Increase Developer Revenue from 50% to 95%

### Parameters being changed with this proposal.

If successful, this proposal will increase the developer_shares parameter in the revenue module from 50% to 95%. The remainder 5% is to prevent spam.

### Motivation

 The `x/revenue` module enables Evmos to support splitting transaction fees between validators/delegators and smart contract developers. As a part of the [Evmos Token Model](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b), this mechanism aims to increase the adoption of Evmos by offering a new stable source of income for smart contract developers. Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer account or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees. The **developer_shares** parameter is the percentage of the transaction fees that are sent to the contract deployer.

Considering the low transaction costs on Evmos the current 50/50 split of EVM tx fees between smart contract developers and validators is insufficient to provide meaningful cash flows for dev teams. An increase to 95% would create more incentives for developers to deploy and register smart contracts on Evmos.

We acknowledge the fact that this change alone might not be significant to sustain developer teams in the short term and are exploring additional alternatives to continue incentivizing teams to build on Evmos in the mid-term.

If this proposal passes validators and delegators will earn zero fees for EVM transactions with registered contracts, but will still earn the [commission on staking rewards](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#what-is-the-incentive-to-run-a-validator) and 95% of the fees from other Cosmos transactions (eg: IBC, Staking, etc).

Our goal with this proposal is to attract and retain smart contract developers as they are the backbone of the Evmos ecosystem and to provide a means to generate sustainable revenue for projects.### Impact

Registered smart contracts will receive 95% of the EVM transaction fees if this proposal passes.

Below are some calculations that might give a clearer example of what developers can expect:
 - At current Evmos price ($0.40637) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 200,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.00466466 * 200000 txs * 0.95 = $886.29**
 - At Evmos price ($2) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 100,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.01669652 * 100000 txs * 0.95 = $1,586.17**
 - At optimistic Evmos price ($4.50) minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 50,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.03756717 * 50000 txs * 0.95 = $1,784.43**

 Gas price calculations were generated with [this](https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evm-gas-prices) calculator. Developers can change the variables to estimate how much revenue their dApps can generate.

"Cancellation of Prop 45, Clarification of Laurel Project Role

# Cancellation of Prop 45, Clarification of Laurel Project Role

This proposal seeks a formal cancellation of Proposal 45, return of funds from the Prop 45 multisig to the Community Pool and a clarification of the role of Loredana and Christian on EVMOS due to recent malicious acts and spam proposals.

This proposal is unfortunately necessary to submit anonymously, due to Loredana and Christian\'s legal threats, which were committed to Github two weeks ago: [https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md)

As such it is important to clarify that this proposal is not being made by the EVMOS Foundation or any of it\'s representatives, and is being brought forth by a community stakeholder of the EVMOS chain who has been witnessing these events unfold. It is my hope that this proposal can bring closure to this governance module spam.

### Clarification of Laurel Project / InterChain Pact Failed Proposals

Many of the recent proposals made by Loredana or Christian seek to interject meaning into what happens if a proposal is rejected - with language such as, ""_if this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law_"".

This proposal therefore seeks to very specifically and pointedly clarify that none of the proposals made by Loredana or Christian which failed to pass have any meaning other than the standard meaning a proposal failure within the typical meaning of the Cosmos SDK: __The Community felt the proposal should not pass, and therefore it has failed. This includes No and NoWithVeto.__

### Previous Behavior
This appears to be a pattern of behavior that goes back to their earlier days on Ethereum as well, as can be seen here:

### Cancellation of Prop 45 and Clarifications of Laurel Project Role

**Loredana (evmos4volunteers, The Laurel Project)** proposed that the EVMOS Community pay for lobbying efforts by subsidizing an apartment in Berlin. It has become clear that this volunteer effort is more of a personal mission than an effort to assist in the furtherance of the chain.

**Christian Tzurcanu (votes4volunteers, The Laurel Project)** has assisted in many of these spam proposals as well, and has actively engaged in socially unacceptable governance behavior when interacting with the community and validator set, particularly within Commonwealth Discussions, Reddit and the EVMOS Community Discord.

**As such this proposal seeks to clarify through social consensus the following points:**

1) Loredana Cirstea does not operate in an official capacity for the EVMOS chain.

2) Christian Tzurcanu does not operate in an official capacity for the EVMOS chain.

3) The Laurel Project and The InterChain Pact are not officially associated in any way with the EVMOS chain, nor should either of them conduct work on the behalf of the EVMOS chain.

4) Proposal 45 should be cancelled and remaining funds returned to the Community Pool.

5) All language contained within the rejected Proposals 84, 88, 93, 95, 98, 99, 100, 105 and 106 are completely nullified. No language contained with any of these proposals is binding upon the network or it\'s constituents. As they failed, they are completely rejected and their failure does not imply any kind of social consensus beyond their failure to pass.

6) Further spam proposals and abuses of the governance module may require more severe community response to prevent additional spam, and the waste of validator and community resources in dealing with this spam and misbehavior. If they continue to abuse the gov module after the proposal deposit raised, network slashing for abuse of the governance module may be required to prevent further harm to governance, the network and it\'s users.

7) All further volunteer efforts by Loredana and Christian are no longer required or desired by the EVMOS community and should be ceased, in perpetuity. 

_NOTE: None of the above points are an official recognition of their volunteer efforts, but a clarification that their involvement is no longer desired on EVMOS, whether volunteered or not._

"New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi Whole Launching

This proposal is to introduce Evmos Liquidity Incentive to [spacefi.io](https://spacefi.io/) and help Evmos liquidity and ecosystem to grow further through the launch of SpaceFi’s entire products suite (DEX+NFT+Spacebase+Launchpad) as well as the SPACE token.

Final Proposal: [[Pre-Vote] New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi whole launching](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8918-prevote-new-evmos-liquidity-incentive-and-spacefi-whole-launching)

Full Discussion: [[IDEATION] New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi whole launching](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8598-ideation-new-evmos-liquidity-incentive-and-spacefi-whole-launching)


## **Abstract**
Since the previous 2M EVMOS Liquidity Incentive was first launched on Diffusion, Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem has shown encouraging growth. At the same time, we are also experiencing some difficulties. The TVL on Diffusion has grown to a height of $7.4M and since Evmos price fell, the TVL has gone down to $2.5M (2023.01.18). During the process, we found 3 issues: first, multiple bridges and liquidity fragmentation; second, mercenary liquidity and reward dumping; and third, the lack of the ecosystem building and Evmos use cases, damaging Evmos’ value. The EVMOS Incentive on Diffusion ended on 2023.01.19.


## **Strategy**

We're trying some new measures to improve Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem.

#### **1. Concentrated Liquidity**
Although Evmos has $2.5M in native liquidity, it is mainly split into 13 trading pairs. We recommend temporarily focusing Evmos Incentive on a single bridge and major trading pairs (ATOM, USDC, wETH, etc.), in order to concentrate the limited liquidity.
According to community's feedbacks, we plan to start from Axelar as the single bridge to concentrate liquidity first. More bridges and assets such as grav.USDT / ceUSDC / stEVMOS (stride) can be added after the effective growth of liquidity.

#### **2. LP Bonding**
To incentivize long-term liquidity providers and to avoid the adverse effects of mercenary liquidity, SpaceFi Farm supports LP Bonding, including no bonding, 7 days unbonding and 14 days unbonding. The longer the LP is locked in the farm, the higher the APR will be.

#### **3. Ecosystem Building**
Evmos Liquidity Incentive is a short-term booster. And the thriving ecosystem projects are the long-term value. SpaceFi has been actively helping new projects get started in Evmos through Incubation and [Launchpad Program](https://twitter.com/spacefi_io/status/1584913982036803594). We've incubated [Soul Network](https://thesoul.network), a cross-chain DID network Cosmos & Ethereum, and also the First Place Winner in the Web3 track of Evmos Hackathon.


## **Action Plan**

According to the community's feedbacks, we plan to apply for 1M EVMOS as the liquidity incentive to start, in a program lasting 90 days, and expect to bring $4-$8M native liquidity with ARP 37% (no bonding) - 73% (14 days unbonding), similar to it on Osmosis. The above is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18. If the liquidity grows well, we may apply to increase the incentive for the further growth.


#### **1. Why Liquidity Incentive**
Evmos native liquidity is still very small and further improvement of liquidity is a priority. In fact, 1M EVMOS is about 2 days' inflationary rewards of Evmos delegating. The value brought by the Liquidity Incentive will exceed the reward itself.

This proposal is not only about Liquidity Incentive, but also about an ecosystem project SpaceFi's whole launching. We hope to bring more use cases for Evmos and more confidence to the ecosystem and community through SpaceFi's performance.


#### **2. Use xEVMOS as the reward, not EVMOS directly**
The [xEVMOS module](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8598-preproposal-new-evmos-liquidity-incentive-and-spacefi-whole-launching) is aimed to incentivize long-term holders and reduce reward dumping.

We‘ll launch a non-tradable reward token, xEVMOS, converted 1:1 from the EVMOS requested.
xEVMOS earned from liquidity incentive can be converted back to EVMOS with a 30 days unbonding period. Users can also choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately, which will only convert back to 50% in EVMOS. The other 50% will be transferred back to the multisig address of requested EVMOS, which can make the incentive program last longer.

With xEVMOS, we can reduce reward spending and dumping while maintaining an attractive APR and incentivizing long-term holders. The liquidity incentive can last more than 90 days if some users choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately. We can also offer xEVMOS module as a public good for other incentive programs in Evmos ecosystem.


#### **3. Multisig Group (3 of 5)**
- 0xCtrlAltApe | Orbital Apes team
- LPX | Evmos DAO Governance
- luisqa | Zenith Station validator
- devd331 | Evmos Community Mod, SpaceFi Captain
- cryptoallen | SpaceFi team

(evmos1p0dgz9gxj9fzk2aqkn5ndeycvylhjhrhptq7tv)


## **Fund Utilization Plan**

We divide the pairs into MAJOR, STABLE, and MINOR categories, borrowing from the incentive allocation in Kickstart DeFi on Evmos proposal by benny lava and other Evmos Governance members. The initial rewards are allocated as follows:


#### **MAJOR: 50%, 5555 EVMOS / day + 29165 SPACE / day**
EVMOS / ATOM - total 250k EVMOS + 1312380 SPACE

EVMOS / ETH - total 175k EVMOS + 918720 SPACE

EVMOS / BTC - total 125k EVMOS + 393750 SPACE



#### **STABLE: 35%, 3888 EVMOS / day + 20414 SPACE / day**
EVMOS / USDC - total 350k EVMOS + 1837260 SPACE



#### **MINOR: 15%, 1666 EVMOS / day + 8754 SPACE / day**
EVMOS / OSMO - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE

EVMOS / JUNO - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE

EVMOS / SPACE - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE




The reward weight for each pair can be adjusted each two weeks based on liquidity & volume data.



TVL Milestone: 1M-2M, APR 146% (no bonding) - 293% (14 days unbonding)

TVL Milestone: 2M-4M, APR 73% (no bonding) - 146% (14 days unbonding)

TVL Milestone: 4M-8M, APR 37% (no bonding) - 73% (14 days unbonding)

The above TVL and APR is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18.


## **This is not just another proposal for Liquidity Incentive**

[SpaceFi](https://spacefi.io/) is a community project with no VC funding, and has been building in the EVMOS ecosystem since February 2022 at our own expense. We want to make it an engine in the ecosystem with DEX+NFT+Spacebase+Launchpad, not just a DEX. At the same time as the EVMOS Liquidity Incentive begins, we will fully launch the SpaceFi product and SPACE token.


The initial emission of SPACE token will be about 125000 SPACE / day, 70% of which will be used for farming rewards, i.e. 87500 SPACE / day. We will allocate 2/3 of the SPACE farming reward to EVMOS Liquidity Incentive, i.e. 58350 SPACE / day. The remaining 1/3 will be allocated to SPACE & Planet NFT staking and other liquidity incentives.


Space Swap and Planet NFT are already live on Evmos mainnet.
[Space Swap](https://swap-evmos.spacefi.io/#/swap) has been running on Evmos since May 2022 to date, with more than 2,000 early adopters providing liquidity on it. [Planet NFT](https://www.orbitmarket.io/collection/0x32c8e6e1ad9d356f1b010cca8de00c11510e8470) is the Pass of SpaceFi ecosystem, early minting has been finished on EVMOS mainnet and is currently the second largest market cap NFT in EVMOS ecosystem.

[Learn more about SpaceFi Products](https://twitter.com/spacefi_io/status/1607655332456857601)


## **What will happen next if this proposal is passed**

- Space Farm, NFT Staking / Marketplace, Spacebase, Launchpad modules will be launched on EVMOS mainnet. (within 1 month)
- SPACE Token launching and Evmos Liquidity Incentive begins. (the 1st week, trial run)
- SPACE Token and EVMOS Liquidity Incentive fully runs. Genesis Spacebase event will be launched. (the 2nd week)
- Spacebase farming reward PK competition. (the 3rd-5th week)
- SpaceFi trading contest. (the 7th-9th week)
- As liquidity grows, we will consider helping new projects to launch on Evmos through Launchpad, possibly Soul Network or others. (TBD)
- Collaborate with other projects to enrich the use cases. More bridges and assets such as grav.USDT / ceUSDC / stEVMOS (stride) can be added after the effective growth of liquidity. (TBD)


## **About SpaceFi**

[spacefi.io](https://spacefi.io/) is a cross-chain web3 platform on Evmos and layer2 zkSync, with DEX+NFT+Launchpad+Spacebase as the initial product. The first to connect Cosmos and Layer2. It has been building in Evmos ecosystem since 2022.02. More than 40k users have tested SpaceFi products on Evmos and zkSync testnet.


SpaceFi has previously conducted extensive testing and completed three contract audits. Here are the Audit Reports by [QuillAudits](https://twitter.com/QuillAudits) , a leading smart contract audit firm who has secured more than 700+ web3 projects with $15B+. A new audit report about xEVMOS module will also be released soon. We'll make the products well tested and audited before the whole launching.

"Encode Club's Evmos Grant Proposal

# Encode Club's Evmos Grant Proposal

## Summary

• Encode Club is requesting approximately $2.5MM (5,200,000 EVMOS tokens @ $.48) to award to the best builders and projects for the duration of the grants program. Allocated funds are to be kept in the Multisig controlled by the Evmos community and distributed only when needed by Encode via multisig composed of trusted community advisory members. Encode's monthly expenses for running the program will be $50k, which can be considered as part of the total requested grants amount as per the community's preference.

• Encode Club is a web3 education community. We help people learn, build and launch their web3 careers. We do this through high quality events such as educate series, hackathons, accelerators and bootcamps.

•Encode Club will organize a pilot grants program for the Evmos community for H1 2023 (Jan to July). Their team will be entrusted with their promotion and furthermore tasked with evaluation of the best projects submissions, making sure that each is up to the standards set by the community.

•Regular community calls shall be established and kept open to both the community and the DAO, which are to be used for questions, feedback and general updates about the program's progress. Additionally, 3 special check-in calls will be scheduled and executed throughout the program - one following the successful setup of the grants program, one midway through and one at the very end, the purpose of which is for Encode to provide further insight regarding grant applications and subsequently grantees.

 ## Abstract

 Establishing an effective grants program is important to champion the growth and development of the Evmos ecosystem because it provides support for projects and initiatives that align with the ecosystem's goals and objectives. This funding can be used to help new protocols launch, research and development, infrastructure, community building, public goods, and other activities that contribute to the growth and success of the ecosystem. Additionally, a grants program can attract and retain talented individuals and organizations to Evmos, as well as increase collaboration and partnerships within the community. Overall, an effective grants program can play a key role in driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and promoting the long-term sustainability of the Evmos ecosystem.

Encode is one of the most trusted and well known companies within the web3 space, known for delivery of top tier program in partnership with the biggest names in the industry. Over the past two years their team has managed to successfully execute more than 90 events (both online and in-person).

## Motivation

Encode Club’s core goal has always been to deliver top tier programs that aid enthusiasts, developers and projects alike in growing, achieving their goals and pushing the web3 space forward. Evmos is a young and blooming ecosystem, and similar to others at this stage of their growth - it is in need of builders that would keep pushing it further and raise the bar higher.

By leveraging the curiosity, knowledge and dedication of their 50,000+ strong developer community, Encode Club can foster high levels of engagement and building for the Evmos ecosystem. Coupled with their past experience of running Saddle’s successful grants program and already having led an Evmos Hackathon through Covelant, their track record proves they are more than capable of successfully executing a program of this magnitude.

Flawless execution of great events is often considered the end result of Encode Club’s efforts. In reality, however, these events are the means by which the true output and contribution to the web3 space is being achieved - identifying talent.

Encode Club is a talent powerhouse.Their community consists of some of the brightest minds of tomorrow - actively participating in a wide variety of events, engaging with different technologies and most importantly - building.

Encode Club will dedicate 8-10 people from their team to deliver an exclusive pilot grants program that will run for the duration of the first half of 2023 with the option of extending it until the end of the year. Their team will be responsible for handling each and every phase of the project including, but not limited to planning, promoting, sourcing, executing and judging.

The Evmos community and team are to be an integral part, functioning as a guiding power and influencing the general direction of the program that the Encode team shall pursue in order to accomplish the objectives outlined by the community and Evmos Core Team.

Encode is to be allocated $2.5MM for the duration of the grants program. The amount will be kept within a multisig, with distributions approved and executed by the Evmos committee multisig in the form of rewards.Their recipients are to be the best developers and projects picked by Encode for fulfilling the prerequisites and goals outlined by the program.

Encode Club will crowdsource ideas for bounties from the community and will decide what bounty size to allocate for each. Each of the bounties should consist of:

•   Brief summary and explanation

•   Clearly outlined deliverables

•   Execution and delivery within the timeline of the program

•   Amount of funding attached

There will be two types of bounties:

•   Competitions – several projects compete and the best gets the bounty award at the end of the program.

•   Award – a single team is selected to answer the bounty, and receives the award upon completion by the end of the program.

Bounties will be listed on the Encode website and public calls for participants will be made. Encode Club will take care of promoting and marketing the initiative as well as organize several education events with community members and investors from the Evmos community throughout the bounty period.

Teams then engage in working, building and polishing their projects by the deadline outlined in the program. The best are to be invited, judged and rewarded in proportion to their efforts and magnitude of impact for the Evmos ecosystem in a show and tell finale events organized by Encode.

In order to ensure transparency and accountability on Encode Club’s side an Evmos Multisig Committee with representatives from both the community will be in direct communication with Encode and will have power to challenge their decisions along the way. The multisig will be overseeing the funds allocation and provide an additional layer of security for Evmos community. Any remaining funds at the end of the initial grants program period will be rolled into future funding upon approval, or returned to the community pool if the community decides not to renew the program.

**Cost Breakdown**:

Encode is a 25 person team and will be putting significant effort across multiple departments and individuals. The following is a rough outline of the costs associated with the proper execution of the grants pilot program:

•   Marketing and Sourcing: $10k per month (on average 2 people)

•   Program Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)

•   Grant Team Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)

•   Book-keeping, Finances + Admin: $2.5k per month (on average 1 person)

•   Hiring support for any grantees: $5k per month (on average 1 person)

•   Tech and Infrastructure: $2.5k per month

This brings the total monthly cost of running the program to $50k. The amount is to be invoiced in advance prior every month and deducted from the total grant size allocated for the program execution.

**Conclusion**

If successful, Encode will be able to start executing as early as mid/late February. Gathering bounty proposals from both the community and the Evmos team will begin immediately after approval.The marketing team will switch focus on promoting the grant program, while also turning the attention of Encode’s existing Cosmos and Evmos hackers within the community to the upcoming events.

Grant applicants will work closely with Encode Club’s program managers throughout the duration of the program in order to ensure that their work follows the guidelines and meets the requirements outlined by the bounties in order to qualify for a grant. Encode will impose deadlines for project submissions, after which the best builders will be invited to present their work live and compete for a prize from the grants pool.

"Evmos x Covalent Hackathon Participant Rewards Re-Adjustment

## Author(s)
- LPX, Evmos DAO 
- Leibing, Covalent

## Summary

Due to the decrease in the price of EVMOS, there is a deficit in the amount of tokens that were originally asked from the pool from [Proposal 54](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/54) and the amount that is needed to pay out all the rewards from the hackathon. It is our belief that it is paramount for the hackathon winners to be rewarded for contributions and efforts in a timely manner to encourage the continued interest and growth of the developer community in the Evmos ecosystem.

- [Commonwealth Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/9429-time-sensitive-evmos-x-covalent-hackathon-payouts-readjustment)
- [Hackathon Page and Winners](https://www.encode.club/evmoscovalent-hack)

## Abstract

- The Covalent x Encode x Evmos Community hackathon concluded last month with participants joining from around the world.
- At the time of the passing of Proposal 54, EVMOS was around $2.50. Currently, the price of EVMOS is ~$0.475.
- This proposal is requesting funds from the Community Pool to balance the rewards payable to current market price as promised in Proposal 54. The total amount requested can be found in the Amount Requested section below.

## Motivation

The #OneMillionWallets hackathon was a successful event that brought together members of the Ethereum as well as Evmos Community to work on exciting projects. However, the price of the EVMOS token has dropped significantly since the hackathon was funded by Proposal #54, resulting in a deficit that needs to be filled in order to pay out the participants.

This proposal aims to ensure that the hard work and effort put in by the participants is rewarded, and that the Evmos Community continues to be a supportive and collaborative space for innovation. Additionally, this proposal will demonstrate Evmos commitment to its Community and show that it keeps its promises.

The original proposal clearly stated the following: 'The amount of tokens for the hackathon prizes of $100k will be determined at time of dispersement. In the case of extreme price volatility, the Governance workstream will assist in readjusting the community pool funding request.'

## Message from Covalent

Thank you for your patience in staying with us and navigating this situation together. The Evmos-Covalent #OneMillionWallets hackathon concluded in December 2022 to great success, where we saw more than 500+ teams registering, more than 60+ projects built, and more than 100 daily quiz participants. It was our biggest and most successful #OMW hackathon to date.

Due to the depreciation of the prize pool, however, we cannot give the winners what we feel they truly deserve. We know how important runway is for teams building in an ecosystem; such runway can only be achieved when the teams are rewarded at the amount after the price movements have been adjusted. We deeply appreciate the EvmosDAO Governance workstream's efforts in readjusting the community pool fund to ensure that projects get the deserved level of funding.

- Leibing, DevRel, Covalent

## Amount Requested

The amount requested pegs the EVMOS price to $0.40 due to market uncertainty. All leftover EVMOS will be returned to the community pool.

The total amount of rewards payable came out to be $60,950 instead of the planned $100K. 50% of the funds in the original multisig that were originally allocated for the hackathon rewards, or 50,200 EVMOS (~$20,080) will be used to help fill this deficit.

- $40,870 ($60,950 - $20,080) for the deficit in the amount of the hackathon winners' rewards (~102,175 EVMOS tokens @ 0.40). [Detailed sheet.](https://evmos.community/covalent-hackathon)
- $17,799 for the organizers of the hackathon (~44,497.5 EVMOS tokens @ 0.40)
- 20,000 EVMOS tokens for a donor that tried to assist in filling the deficit ([TX](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/txs/001094A2EECF02AD8739030656BCECE936F8BECABCD4A6B6FD0FF2166ECF8096))
- **Grand Total: $58,669 + 20,000 EVMOS (roughly 166.6K EVMOS)**

Note: This funding request is specifically for the outstanding amount required to pay out the participants and organizers of the hackathon. The 50% that was initially allocated to Covalent for their services will be released to Covalent - there are no plans to re-adjust the indexing and API integration fees at the moment. The decision to delay the staking of the other 50% by Covalent was not the responsibility of the Evmos Community.

Remaining tokens, assuming that the Evmos token price holds above $0.40 will be sent back to the Community Pool.

"[ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream (Rev. 2)

# ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Workstream (Rev. 2)

## Authors 
- LPX | Evmos DAO
- GV | Evmos DAO 
- Benny Lava | Evmos DAO

Operating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO ([Proposal #51](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51)), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past eight months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.

This proposal applies all rules defined and approved by the community in ECP-1 ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)). An [FAQ page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/faq.md) has been created and will kept up to date with important questions asked by the Community.

## Preface 

Following the rejection of Proposal 86, we have conducted a thorough review of the initial proposal and the valuable feedback provided by the Evmos community and validators. This revised proposal was created with objectives to address issues and concerns raised by the community while remaining aligned with the Governance Workstream's Mission, Vision, and Values. We are confident that this revised proposal achieves this goal.

Addressed issues from Proposal 86:

- The total token request has been significantly [reduced by 80% in this proposal](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).
- R&D, Ecosystem Bootstrap, and Treasury Diversification funds have been excluded in order to facilitate a more targeted dialogue with the community regarding these initiatives and potential funding.
- The retroactive payment request has been decreased by 64% ($750/mo per contributor).
- Additional cost-saving measures include the elimination of 2 future workstream contributors and the request for only the first year of vesting emissions for existing members.

## Abstract

### The Governance Workstream's Mandate

The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.

- Duties, Responsibilities, Deliverables of the Governance Workstream: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/duties.md)

### Contributions to Evmos

The Governance Workstream's wide array of contributions and community service for the past half-year range from simple proposal guidance for projects to both native and external liquidity programs responsible for the movement of tens of millions of dollars. 

- List of Achievements and Progress Report: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/report.md)

### Progressive Decentralization 

We also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.

While we have ambitious plans to create an ecosystem of community owned liquidity and a democratized spending of liquid funds, we have removed all funding requests related to these initiatives for various reasons - separate proposals will be made for these initiatives when we are better prepared to present them.

## Funding Request

This 6-month funding proposal has been pegged to the price of $0.40 / EVMOS. The total funding amount was reduced by ~80% to the previous proposal and represents now 0.81% of the community pool. The dollar amount requested at current price was also reduced from $2.37mil to $380K. For a breakdown of the ask reduction, please [refer to this page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).

**Contributor Compensations**

The funding ask includes the base, retro, and vesting pay for 3 existing Governance workstream members as well as the onboarding of three more members, for a total of 6 Governance workstream members.
- A detailed outline of contributor compensation: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/contributors.md)

**Total:** 950,000 EVMOS

### Fund Disbursements

This funding proposal will kick off the ""DAO Treasury"" which is managed by 3 Governance members and 5 Validators in a `5-8` Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending will be publicly viewable with full transparency. Spending, compensations, swaps, and all expense reports will be rigorously kept up to date.

"DoraHacks Hackathon Proposal with Evmos

## DoraHacks Hackathon Proposal with Evmos

### Summary

The [DoraHacks](dorahacks.io) Team, one of world's most active multi-chain Web3 developer incentive platform, proposes a hackathon partnership with the Evmos community to help attract developers and promote growth within the Evmos ecosystem.

The Hackathon prize pool will be approximately $125k (281,000 EVMOS @ $.44) of non-dilutive funding through a community controlled multisig to be given out as EVMOS tokens to Hackathon winners that show the most promise and meet the needs of the team.

### Abstract

DoraHacks is a global hacker movement and the world's most active multi-chain Web3 developer incentive platform. More than 3,000 projects from the DoraHacks community have received over $30 million in grants and hackathon prizes. DoraHacks.io has around 250,000 active users worldwide. The platform offers hackathons, bounties, quadratic funding, privacy voting, and other community governance/funding toolkits. In addition, over 80 major Web3 ecosystems are currently using Dora infrastructures to fund their open-source communities

The Evmos Hackathon Partnership aims to align all stakeholders by incentivizing individuals and organizations to explore and develop their ideas on Evmos by offering individuals and organizations non-dilutive funding to develop and further the Evmos ecosystem.

### Proposal

 **Goal:**

**1. Branding**

• To leverage DoraHacks’ developer community and DoraHacks.io platform’s traffic to promote Evmos’ dev toolkits and APIs, and onboard more developers to adopt Evmos’s tech stacks and build on Evmos

• To leverage DoraHacks’ expertise in organizing hackathons, virtual or in-person hackathons, workshops, and project demo sessions to help the Evmos team operate developer events globally.

• To involve Evmos in the hackathons, quadratic funding community grants and other events DoraHacks co-host with different open Web3 ecosystems, for instance, BNB Chain, Solana, Filecoin, Avalanche, Moonriver, Polygon, Harmony and more.

**2. Education**

• To host workshops for developers to help them better understand how to build in the Evmos Ecosystem.

**3. Innovation**

•To incentivize global developers to build on Evmos by providing prizes, grants, and investments to the teams emerging from the events DoraHacks and Evmos organize together.

**Scope of Partnership:**

**Hackathons**

**DoraHacks will host virtual and in-person hackathons globally each year. DoraHacks can help the Evmos Foundation with the following**

• Facilitate Evmos global and regional hackathons, dedicated fully to the ecosystem growth of Evmos

• Participate in DoraHacks hackathons, co-hosted with other leading blockchain companies and open ecosystems, as a co-host/sponsor/partner, depending on the exclusivity and scope of the hackathons.

**In the hackathons, DoraHacks will be covering the main operational efforts, including:**

• Basic Logistics of the hackathons - agenda, workshops, judge invitations, promotion material design, etc.

• Hacker and team recruitment: DoraHacks will work with global partners to recruit participants for the hackathon.

**Evmos will be expected to provide the following resources:**

• Prize Pool - the incentive for global devs to participate. From our experience, $125K worth of prize pool can incentivize 50-100 teams to join and build in the Evmos ecosystem.

• Idealists and tracks - Which sectors do you want participating developers and teams to be the focus of the hackathon?

• Invitation of Mentors and part of the Judging panel - core team members are expected to participate in the hackathons to support participating teams and devs.

• Workshops - to better guide devs and projects on project development.

• Workshops can be divided into two categories: technical workshops and business workshops. Speakers can give presentations depending on their expertise. Mentors are also expected to deliver workshops to hackathon participants.

• Marketing Resources - the foundation’s official resources are crucial in the success of the promotion of the Hackathon.Press releases in leading media channels, Twitter promotion and interaction, important promotion efforts like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko banners, etc.

"Build A Community Owned DEX (UniV3)

# Build A Community Owned DEX (UniV3)
## Authors
-  [Orbital Apes](https://twitter.com/OrbitalApes)
-  [Evmos DAO](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO)

## Summary
The Evmos DAO and Orbital Apes team aim to deliver a fully community owned DEX within two months. We believe that Evmos can become market competitive in terms of liquidity and user experience. 

- No investment token 
- No initial swap fees 
- Not profit oriented
- UniV3 functionalities (concentrated liquidity)
- Integrated IBC asset and continous development guaranteed

If this proposal passes, we will ship a V3 DEX deployment in the shortest amount of time. The OA team will handle the engineering side, while the responsibilities of socials management, proposals for incentives and incentives management would be handled by the EvmosDAO.

The requested funds is for the Orbital Apes team only since the Evmos DAO is already fully funded. Funding is requested as this DEX will be built as public good for Evmos and will not have any funding coming from token sales or protocol fees.

*Notes: This can be seen as an alternative to the ICHI proposal. We believe that we can ship a more feature rich DEX at **much lower costs**. To our knowledge, UniV3 is not adding new chains any time soon due to legal reasons.*


## Goal
Create a capital efficient AMM to grow native liquidity on Evmos. This will be achieved with the help of EvmosDAO by creating cross-chain proposals for co-incentives (Evmos and Partnering chain) to LP providers and cross-chain token swaps to create protocol-owned liquidity managed by EvmosDAO.

## Deployment Path of UniV3 Fork

- Engineer custom V3 DEX frontend with IBC<>ERC20 conversion
- Fork UniV3 and deploy modified contracts (no protocol fees, no investement token) in April
- Bridge integration  
- Keplr integration (third party dependency)

### Benefits  
**1 - Liquidity**
The Evmos DAO team will be making proposals on other IBC chains to incentivize this DEX along with supplemented Evmos incentives.Protocol owned liquidty would work along side this as well. This will allow Evmos to build more native liquidity and force wider users to IBC tokens into Evmos. After this more DeFi protocols can be built once on chain liquidity is established.

**2 - Time to market**
We are market ready within two months. Targetting testnet before April and mainnet once the UniV3 license expires. 
*Side note: The whole cosmos ecosystem is moving towards LSD's. V3 positions are much more tuned for these pools then traditional Dex's. V3 is may more profitable for LP's and provides a much stronger peg between something like stAtom/Atom. If we wait 5 months instead of 2 months we could potentially lose a large chunk of this liquidity to other protocols.*

**3 - Keplr integration**
In the near future Keplr is going to have full EVM compatibiltiy. The users will be able to interact with Keplr and Metamask on the DEX.

- [ERC20 Support](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/pull/531)
- [Tx Signing Support](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/pull/483)
- Contracts signing: Once contracts signing is integrated by Keplr the OA will merge it into the DEX.

**4 - IBC conversion page**
Similar to https://app.evmos.org/assets, this will provide a user friendly interface and reduce complexity of onboarding cosmos based users. A bridge section will be added to deposit/withdraw from multiple EVM chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and many more through Satellite (Axelar). 

**5 - No Protocol Fees** 
Traditional decentralized exchanges charge a fee on every swap that flows directly to the protocol or token holders. Initially this will be set to zero, any changes of the fee structure must be approved by the Evmos governance in form of a text proposal. LP fees will still be charged and distributed on swaps to LP providers.

**6 - No Investment Token**
The community owned DEX will not have a corresponding governance token. As a community owned project built by OA/EvmosDAO future major developments will be funded through seperate funding requests or grants programs/boutnies. Incentives for liquidity will come in the form of Evmos incentives proposals and Cross-Chain incentives proposals.


**7 - Future Development: All the upcoming Evmos/Cross-Chain innovation**
- New innovation like ICA and ICQ will be actively explored and integrated the best possible way to stay competitive. Such integration would require a seperate funding request.
- Explore and integrate cross-chain bridge swaps through services such as LiFi.


## Milestones

- Deploy the AMM V3 (Contracts/Frontend/Backend) to the Evmos Testnet | Funds realesed: 40% two weeks after testnet 
- Deploy the AMM V3 (Contracts/Frontend/Backend) to the Evmos Mainnet | Funds realesed: 40% two weeks after mainnet 
- IBC conversion page integration | Funds realesed: 10% after functional integration 
- Keplr integration | Funds realesed: 10% after functional integration 


## Funding Amount
This funding proposal will kick off the development for V3. The requested amount of 200,000 Evmos goes fully to the OA team since the Evmos DAO is already funded by the Evmos community.

Dear Evmosians, we propose to fund 79,750 $EVMOS (= USD $23,925 at $0.3 per $EVMOS) from the Evmos community pool to purchase and retire 7,975 Nature Carbon Ton (USD $3 a credit) on Regen marketplace at [app.regen.network](https://app.regen.network/), to make the Evmos protocol carbon neutral for the year of 2022.

## Regen Network Development PBC commits to hold and stake the 79,750 $EVMOS for 12 months, beginning as soon as the Evmos tokens are sent from the multi-sig address. Any unspent $EVMOS will be returned to the Evmos community pool.

This is an improved proposal version with a significantly reduced ask amount since we excluded CFCs (City Forest Credits) and added a 12-month Evmos price protection (courtesy of Regen Network Development PBC) after taking a lot of community feedback into account.

# EvmosZERO - kicking off ReFi on Evmos!

Why is offsetting Evmos’s carbon emission important for Evmos? Why is ReFi on Evmos a huge opportunity going forward?

Well, carbon credits are financial assets that are rapidly becoming tokenized onto blockchains. Demand for carbon credits is expected to become a $500 billion + industry by 2030, and is already a 6 billion annual industry. The race is on!

Some of the major Ethereum (VM) compatible blockchains, such as Polygon, offset their carbon emission by retiring $400,000 in carbon credits (104,794 tonnes) on KlimaDAO, a Polygon based ReFi market. The decision came after [Polygon’s $20 Million pledge](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-is-going-carbon-negative-in-2022-with-a-20-million-pledge) to become carbon negative in 2022.

Celo, another EVM chain, went a step further and is not only [carbon negative from the get-go](https://blog.celo.org/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490), but it is increasingly becoming the EVM-hub for ReFi by actively investing in projects and collaborating with existing players such as Toucan Protocol on Polygon and Regen Network on Cosmos.

As a first step to kickstart ReFi on Evmos, we are inviting the Evmos protocol to become a part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative and to offset its carbon emission on the Regen Network for 2022. Evmos has its roots in Cosmos (Cosmos Hub prop 44) and this would demonstrate to all stakeholders in the space that strong alliances within the Cosmos ecosystem are possible.

Cosmos ZERO, a partnership of Regen Network and the Interchain Foundation, is an initiative for Cosmos protocols and validators to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for their network validator node infrastructure and operations.

## [Cosmos ZERO Program](https://regennetwork.notion.site/Cosmos-ZERO-Achieve-Protocol-Validator-Net-Zero-Carbon-Emissions-ddd441e3ff3d4dbda83265433843ec10) 
## What are some of the potential synergies between Evmos & Regen that could be addressed in future proposals? 
- Add $EVMOS to the allowed currency list for Regen Network
- Bring NCTs and CFCs as ERC-20 to Evmos
- Launch $EVMOS/$NCT & $REGEN/$NCT pools on Evmos dexes
- Help the Evmos validator set to improve the climate impact of their node infrastructure and thereby reduce the carbon footprint

Regen is providing knowledge and resources to enable ReFi on Evmos. Regen also helped Evmos to push ReFi projects such as Gitcoin, supporting this on the Gitcoin end for many years. Offsetting on Regen is just a first step in this mutual partnership.

"Evmos Mainnet v12.1.0 Upgrade

## Description

### Author

Austin Chandra, Evmos Core Team

### Software upgrade being scheduled with this proposal

If successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [12303000](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/12303000) (around 4pm UTC Fri., 31st Mar. 2023) from its current version [v11.0.2](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v11.0.2) to [v12.1.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v12.1.0). This proposal has a voting time of 120 hours.

### Motivation

By proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validate/upgrades).

### Impact

Evmos v12.1.0 contains the following changes and enhancements:

- Enable basic implementation of Fee Subscription to pay for transaction fees with unclaimed staking rewards
- Support multiple message schemas with EIP-712
- Remove Ethermint dependency by migrating relevant logic to the Evmos codebase to allow for quicker development iteration
- Restrict EVM module to work only with Evmos chain
- Upgrade Tendermint to [v0.34.26](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.26) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.46.10](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.10)
- Grant full amount of airdropped tokens to users affected by an airdrop [early decay bug](https://github.com/evmos/decay-analysis)
- Many small improvements and refactors

A full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v12.1.0).

### Testing

The Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.
On top of the upgrade tests, the Evmos team runs performance tests to monitor the impact of new versions.

### Discussion
Please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/10557-evmos-network-upgrade-to-v1210).",0.00737589283254092
"Treasury stEVMOS/EVMOS Liquidity Pool on Forge

## Author

- Evmos DAO [Telegram](t.me/evmosdao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO)
- Forge [Telegram](t.me/forgedex), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex)

## Summary

This proposal aims to provide liquidity of the Evmos treasury to the stEVMOS/EVMOS pair. We request 2M Evmos, with 1M Evmos allocated for liquid staking. All funds will be added to the Forge stEVMOS/EVMOS liquidity pool (~600k USD). It will be actively managed by the DAO, OA + two trusted and active community members. 

## Abstract

This initiative is designed to enhance the growth and long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. 

It involves requesting 2M Evmos from the Evmos treasury and staking 1M Evmos in the liquid staking module of Stride. The DAO will then allocate 1M stEVMOS and 1M EVMOS to the Forge liquidity pool. This will improve the liquid staked token liquidity of Evmos in the market, and the allocation will be monitored and adjusted based on market conditions and community input.

Rewards Distribution and DAO Sustainability is another key initiative. The rewards generated from liquid staking and the Forge liquidity pool (LP fees) will be directed to the multisig wallet. A portion of the rewards will be used to cover the operational costs of the DEX to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. This includes development, maintenance, moderation, promotion, marketing, legal and compliance duties. As of today we have monthly costs of roughly ~1k USD (graph service, quote api). The remaining rewards will be allocated for Forge bounties. Bounties are a common way for decentralized exchanges to incentivize developers and security researchers to contribute to the platform. Here are some potential bounties: 

- Feature bounties: A feature bounty program incentivizes developers to contribute new features or improvements to the platform's codebase.
- Education bounties: An education bounty program incentivizes users to create educational content about the platform, such as blog posts, videos, or tutorials.
- Bug bounties: A bug bounty program rewards security researchers for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities or bugs in the platform's codebase.

We value transparency and accountability in all aspects of our operations, including our bounty programs. As part of our commitment to transparency, we will provide quarterly reports detailing the bounties we have offered and the costs associated with Forge.

To ensure the security and integrity of staked funds and community assets, Univ3 liquidity pools will be utilized, which have a proven track record of security and reliability on Ethereum. Acknowledging the potential risks associated with the liquid staking provider Stride, which has undergone multiple audits and implemented IBC limits to minimize vulnerabilities. As a comparison, the ATOM accelerator program also liquid staked around 60k ATOM (~600k USD) by using Stride. **Additionally, Stride has partnered with Forge and committed to incentivize pools on Forge with their own governance tokens.** 

By implementing this proposal, the Evmos community can expect improved utility and value from the treasury funds, increased market liquidity, and a more sustainable DAO and Forge DEX model. A LSD pool by the treasury, along with the security measures in place, will contribute to the overall growth and success of the Evmos ecosystem. 

## Stride

The Stride DAO will be providing incentives as soon as technically possible. If the community provides treasury liquidity of stEVMOS/EVMOS it allows stride to incentivize different pools (like stEVMOS/USDC) instead which brings more external TVL into the Evmos ecosystem.

## Timeframe

After careful consideration and discussion, the general agreement is to pool these funds into a liquidity pool for a period of 6 months. A follow up proposal will be made to renew after the specified period. If the renewal is rejected, the 2M Evmos will be returned. The requested funds only provision liquidity to Forge. 

Side note: If a vault provider that is trusted deploys on Evmos, it could be worth considering entrusting the management of the LP position to the vault.

## About Forge

The Evmos DAO and OA teamed up and delivered a fully UniV3 compatible DEX on Evmos. Forge is fully community owned and funded. 

What we offer is: 

- No investment token
- No initial protocol fees
- Not profit oriented
- UniV3 functionalities (concentrated liquidity)
- Integrated IBC asset (coming soon)
- One click liquid staking button (coming soon)

[See full proposal here](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/113)

## Multisig 4/6

The position must be adjusted on a regular basis because stEVMOS accrues value against EVMOS daily. Therefore, it is important to keep the multisig simple and effective.

## Summary

The Forge team recognizes the valuable tools and resources for v3 that Revert Finance would bring to the Evmos ecosystem and have been in talks for deployment. This proposal aims to formalize the partnership and commitment to deploy, which will also allow the start of the incentives programs on Forge through their unique time-vested [incentives contracts](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q).

## Introduction to Revert Finance

Revert Finance is a well-known protocol in the DeFi landscape for their unparalleled tools, data and analytics, and resources to optimize Univ3 liquidity positions, empowering users to make the most of their liquidity. Valuable analytics such as a position’s PNL, ROI, impermanent loss, historical data, amount invested, etc., provides great insights that are easily understood by users.

Revert has a solid track record, with successful collaborations with Uniswap deployments on other networks, such as [Polygon](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/_FfxBuW7iNwyJZuM796J3rHzRQ4wOYdAck3nWqqcoIE) and [Optimism](https:/mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/9GC9GWqygz-naejNxHueFZSH3RXCltqZ9BT_4LsWsWg). 

We encourage everyone to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O61msPF5MYw) to learn more and get detailed insights on Revert’s tools. 

## Tools

**Position Analytics:** Check and easily track the performance of your positions on Forge. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/position-analytics/uniswap-v3-positions).

**Top positions:** The Top Positions section shows a list of the top active positions based on how they are performing overall on Evmos. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/top-positions).

**Incentives:** Revert has an incentives section that displays the currently running incentives programs on the Uniswap v3 canonical staker contract, as well as the time-vested staker contract. Uniswap v3 position dashboards automatically detect and display the rewards accrued by each position. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/liquidity-incentives/time-vested-v3-staker).

**Initiator:** The initiator helps users *initiate* LP positions. Opening positions on concentrated liquidity AMMs requires making important decisions about price ranges, which can be greatly aided with historical data and analysis. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/initiator/start-providing-liquidity).

**Auto-compounding:** The Revert auto-compounder allows LPs to automate the compounding of the accrued fees in exchange for a fixed percentage of the compounded fees. This serves to incentivize a maximum number of compounds at optimal times with regards to gas costs. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/auto-compounder).

**Position Management:** The position management interface is available from the account and position pages, where LPs can Add or Withdraw Liquidity and Claim Fees. Within this interface, you can also swap tokens to align with your desired ratio when adding liquidity, withdrawing, or claiming!

## Milestones and Deliverables

Deliverables refer to the tangible or intangible items that are completed by Revert Finance. These deliverables are grouped together into milestones. The team at Revert Finance has set a target of completing all the deliverables within ~8 weeks, with the goal of demonstrating a long-term commitment to the project. Milestone 1 is prioritized by Revert to help with the roll out of Forge incentives. The project start date is May 1st. 

**Milestone 1 - Incentive Tools [25% release 1 months after completion]**

- Vested v3staker contract: Deployment of the vested v3 staker contract on EVMOS
- Vested v3staker frontend: allowing anyone to stake positions and the creation of incentive programs for Forge pools.

**Milestone 2 - Analytics and Indexing** **[25% release 2 months after completion]**

- Analytics for existing positions: LPs are able to track PNL, APR, Fees etc for their positions
- Indexing of top positions: Users are able to browse and explore the catalog of existing positions across Forge pools

**Milestone 3- Position Management and Auto-compounder [25% release 3 months after completion]**

- Initiator / backtester for Forge pools: Users are able to backtest and create new positions using the revert interface
- v3utils contract and frontend: Utilities for LPs, swap and mint, move ranges, etc..
- Auto-compounder: Deployment and support for the auto-compounder contract and protocol including auto-compounding bots

**Milestone 4 - Keplr integration [25% release 4 months after completion]**

- Integration of Keplr wallet

## Revenue Module

The contracts that are deployed in Milestone 1 (vested v3staker contracts, i.e. pool incentives) will be registered on the [x/revenue module](https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/modules/revenue) with the Forge Community Multisig Safe as the `WithdrawerAddress`.

This will demonstrate Revert’s commitment and alignment with Forge’s core concept of being community owned, assist in the long-term goal of becoming a self-sustainable public good of Evmos, and shows good faith in Revert’s desire to grow alongside with the Evmos Community.

## Funding Amount

The requested amount of 200,000 Evmos goes fully to the Revert Finance team if the milestones and deliverables are met. If the Revert Finance team fails to deliver within 4 months after the proposal passed, the remaining funds will be returned.

## Summary

Introducing **Inferno** - a 12 week long incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in [Forge](https://app.forge.trade/#/swap), the community owned DEX of Evmos. The Forge team is requesting 3,000,000 Evmos to fund this initiative. The program aims to solve the liquidity issue on Evmos but also leverages the potential of concentrated liquidity and staked assets. Such a highly attractive incentive program combined with concentrated liquidity and LST has never been done in the Cosmos ecosystem before. Potentially making Forge the most capital efficient DEX within the Cosmos!

## Goal

Create sustainable liquidity and volume on Forge but also raise awareness about DeFi on Cosmos with solidity-based applications. 

## Abstract

**Motivation**

The Evmos blockchain has the potential to become a unique environment for DeFi in the IBC ecosystem, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth. By incentivizing staked assets (such as stEVMOS, stATOM, rETH) people will earn staking rewards while providing liquidity and participate in the incentive program; no DEX on Cosmos has done this yet which is a unique value proposition of Forge. On top of that highly concentrated pools can be created between the native and staked asset (such as stATOM/ATOM) with limited impermanent loss risks but lot of revenue potential.

**Action plan and Pools** 

The full incentive program has a duration of 84 days - divided into 4 periods of 21 days.  Before each period the incentive rewards will be liquid staked to stEVMOS and rolled into the 21 days program. As a result of liquid staking, the Stride DAO council committed to add 1,000 STRD/day to the incentive program. 

We selected 7 pools in total and put them into three different incentive tiers. Our goal is to avoid fragmentation and get deep base liquidity on Evmos. The requested daily emissions equal to 7.9% of the current staking emissions. Users providing liquidity will potentially earn staking rewards, liquidity emissions from this program and LP fees. To find a rough estimate of the APR at $1M TVL per pool, please open the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133w6CmVNSxg78Zbtmd83VDrux244WXUsQbeqqO--PHY/edit?usp=sharing). Keep in mind that if the TVL is below $1M TVL, the APR is higher and vice versa.  

**Tier 1 - ~9,286 EVMOS daily emission per pool**

- stEVMOS/stATOM
- stEVMOS/axlUSDC (+ 600 Stride incentives)
- stEVMOS/axlRETH

**Tier 2 - ~2,589 EVMOS daily emission per pool**

- stEVMOS/STRD  (+ 200 Stride incentives)
- stATOM/ATOM (+ 200 Stride incentives)

**Tier 3 - ~1,339 EVMOS daily emissions per pool**

- axlUSDC/ceUSDT
- axlRETH/axlWETH

**Vesting**

The time-vesting uniswap staker is a [fork of the Uniswap v3 staker](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q) that adds a linear vesting period for positions to receive the full amounts of the accrued rewards. Linear vesing of rewards is intended to prevent ultra-concentrated liquidity from gaming the incentives and extract most of the rewards.  You can read more about it on this [post](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q).

While the incentive rewards accrue proportional to *liquidity*, in the same way that trading fees do, the vested fraction increases linearly while the position is in range. Rewards that have not been accrued to positions not being staked or out of range or withdrawn before end of vesting period, would be rolled over to the next cycle.

**Rewards claiming** 

Vesting is calculated when you unstake the position. So, when you unstake the position, the contract checks if the liquidity was active for longer than the vesting period. If it is, you get all rewards for the amount of active liquidity you provided in the time period. if it's not it gives you the ratio of timespent/vesting period*(rewards received if there was no vesting period). 

**Timeline**

Incentives can kick off once they're approved through governance and after Revert completes atleast the first two milestones of their funding proposal. We estimate the week of the 22nd May. 

**Adjustments**

If the liquidity of a pool does not match our expectation we might make adjustments on the allocation per pool as we learn during this program. Each change will be discussed on [Forge’s social channel](https://t.me/forgeDEX) and communicated upfront.

"EVMOS GRANT - Airdrop Calculator built by Cryptech

Cryptech is a web3 software development team with experience building an Airdrop Calculator for the Neptune Finance team on the Terra blockchain.

An Airdrop Calculator is a helpful application and dev tool that makes it easy for project teams to provide individual wallets with an airdrop according to chosen parameters. Without an Airdrop Calculator, it is costly in time and network resources for each team to manually track delegations and design an airdrop algorithm. This saves on dev time and gets airdrops into the hands of the Evmos community faster!

Cryptech is proposing to build a calculator web app with features for project teams, data analysts and individuals. The web app allows teams and analysts to choose an airdrop  distribution style (quadratic distribution, time-weight, single snapshot, etc.) and export a json or csv file that illustrates each wallet’s delegations, and the airdrop share they are expecting to receive. Additionally, the app will allow individuals to head to the Airdrop Calculator web page to calculate their delegations and the time spent delegating.

This app will help project teams save time calculating airdrop shares and help individuals track their delegations. To build this web application and make it available to the Evmos community, the Cryptech team is seeking 19,500 EVMOS tokens (~45k USD based on 14-day price average) to fund the following line items:

- Full-stack web developer
- Cloud infrastructure engineer
- UX and graphics design
- Data logging services and indexing
- Running a private archival node until a public node is available
- Web hosting for the application

For the sake of community confidence, the tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet controlled by community members, where 40% of the allocation to be provided up front to begin work and the remaining 60% to be delivered when MVP is online to continue improvement.

"Evmos Mainnet v5.0.0 Upgrade

## Author

Daniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team

## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal

If successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.

## Motivation

By proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).

## Impact

On a high level, the 'v5.0.0' software includes the following improvements:

* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with 'erc20/' names to be sent over IBC
* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the 'MinGasPrice' and 'MinGasMultiplier' fee market parameters
* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance
* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates

Software upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:

* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds
* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with 'erc20/'
* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged
* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors
* Set the 'MinGasPrice' param value to '25,000,000,000aevmos' (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))
* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas

A full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

## Testing

The Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).

audits, legal, and minor development costs.

We are looking **$150000** or **100000** evmos (taking price as $1.5) for  in the form of Evmos tokens which we (Exswap) will repay to the Evmos community pool in the form of $evmos token after we launch our token, besides this we also plan to airdrop to evmos stakers, we haven't taken snapshot of that yet

We are requesting this loan in lieu of a public raise which we believe is more appropriate considering the current market conditions.The funds will be used in

- **auditing expenses** 

 - **legal expenses** 

 - **operating expenses**

Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool and the funds that were used will be repaid after we launch the protocol on mainnet.

"Bootstrap liquidity on Evmos dapps

The Evmos community is requesting funds to be distributed to a handful of prominent up and coming applications deploying on Evmos to bootstrap liquidity from the community.

In addition to bootstrapping liquidity on Evmos dapps, it is also designed to reinforce the goal of the Evmos team to reduce liquidity fragmentation by incentivizing pools with Nomad represented ERC-20 assets specifically.

You can find some additional context to this proposal on a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/altcoinpsycho/status/1522617728137269248?s=21&t=9d8JRZj6AK0hFv_zLl0ipA) I previously wrote.

There are 7 projects in total that will be participating, each receiving 115k $EVMOS tokens

Here’s the list of incentivized projects:
*Diffusion
*Midas Capital
*Kinesis Labs
*Saddle Finance
*Exswap
*Cronus
*Coslend

Additionally, 20% of each project’s token allocation must be used for FRAX / FXS incentivized pools where at least 1 token is Frax / FXS.  This means 23k tokens will go towards Frax / FXS pools

Frax has signaled their desire to become a fully collateralized stablecoin native to the Evmos ecosystem. This would help reinforce that, and would unlock many great use-cases for Evmos.

The funds will be sent to a multi sig with myself and founders of the projects mentioned for a 5 of 7 multi sig with. The members on the multi sig are:
*myself
*kinesis
*cronus
*coslend
*exswap
*diffusion
*saddle
The multisig address is evmos:`0x27319052224B1E0cb6C7250f4BD4EE0e3a76755f`

The multisig will distribute tokens to project founders in equally split amounts to be allocated as incentives for those that provide liquidity during the program’s duration of 3 months.

The grants are intended to be as inclusive as possible, while also remaining competitive to projects that have shown strong traction or been very active participants in the Evmos ecosystem. With that said, there will be additional grant proposals like this to consider future projects that were not included in this initial proposal.",0.4942534804303412

"Incubation Proposal: ChainHub/Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos

## INCUBATION PROPOSAL
**Sriram Vishwanath (Professor, University of Texas Austin)**
**ChainHub & Texas Blockchain Incubator**
**sriram@chainhub.net**
# INTRODUCTION
This proposal details an incubation partnership agreement between ChainHub (the incubation arm of Texas Blockchain) and The Evmos Community. ChainHub is an incubator, currently based in Austin TX (which is expanding to Pittsburg, PA and other cities in the USA in coming months) focused on University students and College Blockchain clubs. ChainHub actively incubates projects from The University of Texas, Austin and the surrounding Austin community, and post-expansion, will be incubating projects from Carnegie Mellon University as well as other Universities/Colleges within the USA.
ChainHub is managed by Sriram Vishwanath. Sriram is a Professor of Engineering at The University of Texas, Austin. He has a PhD from Stanford, an MS from Caltech and a BTech from IIT Madras. He is one of the founders of Texas Blockchain ([https://www.texasblockchain.org/](https://www.texasblockchain.org/)) and he teaches the engineering and software centric blockchain classes on University of Texas Austin campus.
Linkedin Profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/)
# OUR EXPERIENCE
Texas Blockchain has been working on projects within the blockchain/crypto domain for roughly 5 years, and ChainHub is its incubation arm. We currently incubate projects within two other ecosystems: Polkadot and NEAR, and we have similar agreements in place with each of the ecosystems. Some of the incubated projects include: The Quai Network [https://quai.network/](https://quai.network/), Zyfty [https://zyfty.io/#/](https://zyfty.io/#/), Mirror World [https://www.mirrormy.world/](https://www.mirrormy.world/) and a few other projects still in stealth.
ChainHub proposes to work with Evmos to incubate approximately two projects a year, on a calendar year basis, tailored to Evmos's priorities and needs. To this end, we will work closely with Evmos to converge on two or more projects and bring together a highly capable team to deliver on each project. These teams will be mentored, managed and funded by ChainHub through a grant provided by Evmos (see budget request below).
# SUMMARY OF TERMS
1. ChainHub will:
1. Incubate approximately two projects per year, starting with September 2022. These projects will be selected in close coordination with the Evmos team.
2. Support these projects from their inception to minimum viable product (MVP) completion. We will staff each project with a talented and passionate team of students/alumni from the Universities/Colleges with which we are co-located.
2. Evmos will:
1. The Evmos Foundation will work closely with ChainHub to identify projects and mentor each project team.
2. The Evmos Community ChainHub (see budget request below) will provide resources necessary towards execution.
3. The Evmos Foundation will partner with each project team: help with pitch-deck/fundraising, product roadmap and long term strategic growth of each entity resulting from this incubation process.
With the exception of 2022, ChainHub will submit a new proposal in Q1 of each calendar year for the Evmos Community's consideration for renewal of this engagement for that calendar year.
# BUDGET REQUEST
As tokens are volatile and ChainHub/Texas Blockchain will bear all the costs of development of the project, we request $1M in tokens per calendar year for the duration of this incubation agreement. This will cover the costs of project incubation (including developers, designers, audits, incubation space and operational support for each project).
We request the tokens be provided as follows:

The first 50% at kickoff with Evmos (206611 Evmos equivalent to $0.5M)
2. The next 25% when the first project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (103305 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)
3.The final 25% when the second project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (103305 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M).

A breakdown of costs across the two projects are (these are rough order of magnitude):
1. Engineering Team/Developers/Product Lead - 700K
2. Full time Designer (for both projects) - 75K
3. Incubation space - 75K (covers space rent, utilities, laptops, monitors, all infrastructure including 6 servers)
4. Audits - 75K (for the entire platform(s) including full stack software, not just the smart contracts)
5. Operational Staff (payroll/HR/health insurance/misc software) - 75K
Each engineering team/devs/product lead will comprise of: approximately 3 Web3 + backend engineers, 2 part-time or full time front-end engineers, and 1 product lead.

The tokens will be staked and existing incubator resources will be used until those resources are exhausted. When exhausted, we will primarily aim to use OTC services to convert tokens to USD. When OTC services are unavailable or limited, we will use other means of conversion to USD. If OTC services are unavailable, we will limit ourselves to at most 30K a month in conversion to USD.
A multisig will be setup to manage this schedule by members of the community. When the Evmos Foundation marks a particular project's MVP as complete, the associated tranche of tokens will be released to ChainHub.

Project Specs: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZfxh8KBtf4r1ZFaJ9Za6jaYVH1FjbTR8y16TeLVAiT7s](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZfxh8KBtf4r1ZFaJ9Za6jaYVH1FjbTR8y16TeLVAiT7s)

EvLend aims to be the most efficient variable rate borrow-lend market on Evmos.

EvLend uses reactive interest rate technology to target specific utilization rates (% of funds in the money market being borrowed) for stablecoin assets while still providing support for borrow & lend services to other assets.

Reactive interest rates are a more recent innovation popularized by Euler finance. EvLend takes the power of this concept and maximizes it for stablecoin markets.

EvLend can demonstrate a standard model by which maximum efficiency of interest rates may be reached. Building such a system can lead to economies of scale and majority share of lending volume for a given core stablecoin.

The lead developer for EvLend is Max Feldman.

Here is a video walk-through of the documentation by the team: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG0uZpD26w8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG0uZpD26w8) 

More information on reactive rates, our stablecoin focus, and project development timeline can be found in the GitBook specs link above.

2. **Evmos Bridge**

Project Specs: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ91nSC5ZDun6xw5Kuc4agMnfX7i4y5fKPe5ESqchSWox](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ91nSC5ZDun6xw5Kuc4agMnfX7i4y5fKPe5ESqchSWox)

We propose a bridge tailored to maximize the ease of onboarding into the Evmos ecosystem. Our solution focuses on supporting the most bridge paths into and out of Evmos as well as focusing on user education to increase usage within the Evmos and broader Cosmos ecosystem.

The proposed bridge will consist of a liquidity network architecture utilizing native assets and thus no minting and burning. Additionally, we will build the cross-chain protocol leveraging a battle tested security and consensus model that is as secure as the economic security of the blockchains it is built upon.

With the minimal bridge paths available today, Evmos will continue to struggle with onboarding users and value into the ecosystem.

Providing routes for users to bridge from the most popular DeFi hubs streamlines the process to onboard value into Evmos by orders of magnitude. By the end of Q3 2023 we plan on having Evmos, Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism integrated into the network.

Additionally, Chainhub will be resposible for running and maintaining the required validators for the liquidity network while this contract is active.

The lead developer for Evmos Bridge is Thad Hutcheson:

"Evmos Ecosystem Campaign by Galxe

**Summary**

The Galxe team proposes allocating $400K USD in EVMOS to fund targeted campaigns and initiatives that provides Evmos with exposure to new users and drives organic growth on-chain. Leveraging our existing user base and previously successful campaigns, Galxe will guide users through the Evmos ecosystem to complete on and off-chain tasks and reward them with EVMOS tokens for doing so. These campaigns will involve partnerships with current Evmos dapps, and can expand to more other protocols as they launch on Evmos as well. With a large portion of the Rektdrop being clawed back, users who missed out have a chance to engage with the ecosystem. This will bring value to the Evmos community through expanding the user base, and providing outside users with direct exposure to Evmos and its native dapps.

Disclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.

**Motivation**

Galxe is the leading Web3 credential data network in the world. A collaborative credential infrastructure enabling brands and developers to engage in communities and build robust products in Web3. Galxe’s infrastructure allows dApps to grow their community off chain and their protocol on chain through Galxe’s tools. Think of Galxe as a way to deploy on chain loyalty programs and customized growth marketing campaigns by distributing NFT badges. Up to this point, Galxe has over 11,100+ credentials contributed to its network, worked with over 1,200+ ecosystem partners, produced 8,000+ campaigns, and built up a community of 8.2M+ Galxe ID users. Credentials are a user’s footprint on or off the blockchain that represents their behaviors and actions taken (e.g., follow twitter, retweet, attend an AMA, swapping, staking, farming etc.)

Diffusion, Orbital Apes, and SpaceFi have already agreed to be part of the Evmos Ecosystem Campaign on Galxe. The community can suggest other dapps that are live as well as future projects that launch on Evmos. Simple on-chain and off-chain tasks will be leveraged that will allow for high exposure and a low barrier of entry to the Evmos ecosystem. Potential tasks and credentials can include the following:

● Following socials (Twitter/Discord)
● Retweet/Quote Tweet a specific tweet
● Make a swap
● Provide liquidity
● Buy an NFT and hold for X amount of time

The goal of this initiative is to drive off chain and on chain growth to the Evmos ecosystem.

● Introduce the Galxe community of 8.2M+ active wallet addresses to the Evmos ecosystem
● Introduce the broader crypto ecosystem to the Evmos ecosystem through Galxe’s tools and co-marketing power: Joint AMA’s, Blog post, Retweets, Quote Tweets, Tweets all throughout the campaign, Discord/Telegram communication, Campaign featured on our main carousel see: [https://galxe.com/campaigns](https://galxe.com/campaigns).
● Engage users who aren’t currently in the ecosystem
● Educate users on Evmos through learn to earn and participate to earn NFT campaigns

**Funding Request**

Galxe is requesting a rewards pool of $400k USD in Evmos that will go entirely to community members. We’re waiving integration fees for this type of campaign but want to make sure the participating community is incentivized and rewarded appropriately. Prior ecosystem campaigns have put forth rewards that have included token airdrop allocation and special governance rights. Solana put forth a rewards pool of $1M USD to participating users and Moonbeam allocated 1.5% of their token supply to this type of campaign. Funds will be handled and distributed by a multisig wallet controlled by the Evmos community throughout this entire process. The community members who take part in the engagements can expect to receive the funds after the campaign is over. The Evmos Community can decide how reward distribution will be handled. After the integration of Evmos into Galxe, any dApp in the Evmos ecosystem will be able to run growth campaigns on Evmos on Galxe for years to come.

"The Alternative: An Honest DAO and an Independent Evmos Chain

My real name is Loredana Cirstea. I have been volunteering for more than 100h/week for Evmos, Ethermint, and blockchain technologies. For the core Evmos I have implemented the fee split module (renamed to revenue), global minimum gas limit, first to prototype and demo working, innovative precompiles for having access to IBC, Cosmos SDK, IPFS, IPLD, etc. from inside the EVM. More information [here](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/tree/master/evmos). My work is proven by [GitHub](https://github.com/loredanacirstea) and [my technical demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos). I am an early investor in Evmos, representing a volunteer organization. And I manage the evmos4volunteers validator.

I invested all my energy and skills to make Evmos better and showing others what it can do, since February 2022.

## An Independent Evmos Chain

I want to see Evmos DAO as a body that fully implements the independence of Evmos:
- the Evmos Community cannot be rug pulled by unknown dues from just a couple of actors.
- the investors of Evmos (those who brought value and raised the price of Evmos for everyone's benefit) and the contributors of effort to Evmos have a strong say in the governance of Evmos 
- the Evmos DAO does not have hidden influences from any 3rd party
- the Evmos DAO is subservient to the Evmos Chain
- the Evmos DAO bodies have a mechanism of checks and balances that will disincentivize corrupt practices

## The ECP-x Proposals - Issues

Looking at proposal https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83 and [the subsequent proposals in plan](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions/2.%20Evmos%20DAO%20Proposals) by the same group (led by LPX, Bennylava, GV), the issues are:
- the authors baked their names in the formation of the organization
- all operations of their organization have not been public
- they started filling out roles before the organization was ratified on-chain
- they dismissed other competing ideas for Evmos DAO that were already presented
- they don't accept improvements to their text if you tell them what is wrong
- they already have bigger powers in the Evmos Discord than any other validator or investor, even in their unofficial capacity, and they can focus the attention of voters and validators on topics that they want
- their real identities are not known to the Evmos Community
- they have no supervisor to hold them accountable. The Evmos Community cannot do that, because their operations are not public
- I have been contributing as a volunteer to Evmos from before its genesis but I (nor others who contributed to Evmos governance) was not invited by this group to join this governance workstream. So, it is not merit that earns you a position in their governance workstream.
- their relationship with Tharsis and Evmos Foundation is unclear. If they have formed this group and given them the above powers, then there is no Evmos Community in the Evmos DAO, and between the voting power of the core team, VC validators, foundation delegations promises, a controlled governance process, there is no chain independence.
- their texts for Evmos DAO are very long, lack substance, and are evasive. Formation texts need to be precise.
- the erosion of Governance (as we know it in Cosmos):
    - [ECP-2A]/Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)/B. Off-Chain Community Governance (In Progress) has conflicts of control: what happens when the Cosmos side votes YES on a proposal and the EVM side votes NO on the same proposal? (These types of problems have been solved by my quasar solution.)
    - [ECP-3] talks about $GOV as governance token. It is unclear from the document what role this has in the actual Governance process. This is intentionally evasive. 


## Solutions: An Honest DAO

1. Read the alternative texts: [A Vision for Evmos: Proven Independency](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7846-a-vision-for-evmos-proven-independency)
2. Decide how to vote: either vote YES to proposal #83 and their other ECP-x proposals or vote NO and wait for the above alternative to be proposed on-chain.

- my alternative Evmos DAO does not propose anybody in any official position
- subsequent proposals will prove and guarantee Evmos chain independence from past dues and any occult forces but lay out in the open the deserved influence that Evmos founders and important proven contributors should have
- I will not ask for retroactive pay for my services, like the authors of #83 plan. Nor should the chain accept to pay for services that were not solicited. My proposal for this: [Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services)
- the quasar technology (cosmos sdk <-> EVM communication) that I invented (and demoed) will be able to bring flexible governance on-chain, to the token holders. Such as the ability to choose one option from many and add new options during voting, or continuous voting. E.g. the chain directly and continuously decides on Evmos DAO bodies, offices, and their members.

## How to vote on this proposal

First, I apologize for putting this as an urgent proposal, without prior discussion (even though my listed commonwealth proposals & criticism have much more than the required 3 days of pre-chain discussions). I was forced by circumstance: proposal #83 being put on-chain before chain independence of dues has been achieved.

This proposal is for bringing the dialogue on-chain when the dialogue off-chain is evaded.

We let the Evmos Community know that there are alternatives to the present Evmos DAO proposals. If you want to keep the Evmos chain independent and decentralized, you want to know them before voting on #83.

"[ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream

## Authors

 - LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council
 - GV, Evmos DAO Governance Council
 - Benny Lava, Evmos DAO Governance Council
## Summary
[ECP-2A](https://evmos.community/ECP/2A.html) is the follow-up proposal of [ECP-1](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md), which set the foundational layer for Evmos DAO Governance ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)).

Operating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO (Proposal #51), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past six months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.
### Important Notice

- [ECP-2A - Full Proposal (HTML)](https://evmos.community/ECP/2A.html)
## Abstract
### Foreword
The overwhelming community support and the shared beliefs in our vision have been truly inspiring. The support shown by the community is not taken for granted - our pledge for progressive decentralization is at the core of everything we do, and we are committed to working to build a stronger, brighter ecosystem for Evmos. For those that want to deep-dive into the philosophical reasoning behind our proposal, [a prologue has been published (warning: long read).](https://mirror.xyz/evmosdao.eth/rSZyD_MAO4zkA46lvqi-f9P5YfVBrnMsU3TShBWK-sY)
### The Governance Council
The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.

The Governance Council's wide array of achievements and community work for the past half-year are listed in the *Progress Report* section of ECP-2A.

We also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and even replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.
Get familiarized with our short to mid-term initiatives with through the [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper).
## Funding Request
We recognize the current market conditions and its volatility, while unfortunate, we must continue to push forward. We have pegged the price of Evmos to $0.50 for this Funding Cycle (6-months).

- **A. Contributor Compensations:** 1,233,668 EVMOS
- **B. Research & Development Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS
- **C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS
- **D. Treasury Diversification & Future WS Comps:** 1,560,000 EVMOS
- **Total:** 4,743,668 EVMOS (~790,611 EVMOS / month, ~4.2% of CommunityPool)

We are currently in talks with a few Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams via a token-for-stable swap. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our operational runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market.

A more detailed itemized list of requested funds can be found in the full proposal as well as the the Litepaper.
### Fund Disbursements
This funding proposal will kick off the ""DAO Treasury - Phase 1"" which is managed by 3 Council Members and 3 Active Validators in a 4-6 Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending is publicly available for viewing with full transparency.

**Fund Signatories**:

- Tam | TC Network
- CO | Orbital Apes
- Rok | Qubelabs
- Benny | Governance
- LPX | Governance

(evmos1670l07l2533t0w9tvd529uaz20majs3rf57zgz)

**DAO Treasury - Phase 2** will be implemented when ready. This change in Treasury Management will mean funds will need to pass off-chain spending proposals as shown in the Litepaper.

"Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services

# No Payment For Unsolicited Services

Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services)

Purpose: achieve moral independence from services that are not solicited by the chain.

Do not solicit retroactive payment for services/products from the Evmos Community Treasury if those services/products and payment amounts were not agreed upon, voted on, and passed through Evmos's governance process.

This is not precluding people from giving their services to the chain, without being paid (as a volunteer).

## Exceptions

1. Force majeure situations in which the service proposal cannot be done through a normal governance process (e.g. chain halt)
2. Emergency situations (e.g. hack event)
3. This proposal does not affect services solicited by the Evmos Foundation, or Tharsis, on behalf of the chain and promises made before the chain mainnet genesis.
4. Unsolicited services rendered for the Evmos chain before this proposal, can be retroactively paid if a Community Treasury proposal is made before block 10000000.

"Governance Consensus: The Governance Language is English

## The Natural Language for the Governance of the Evmos Chain is English

Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8551-governance-consensus-the-governance-language-is-english](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8551-governance-consensus-the-governance-language-is-english)

### Purpose

Clarify the parameters for the natural language used in Evmos Governance.

### Exposition

To achieve authority of Governance, the chain needs to establish the most accessible ground for debate and voting. The language for the process of Governance is one of the main parameters and we consider that the best language for Evmos Governance is the English language.

Since the meaning of the sentence and therefore paragraph can be changed by choice of word meaning, by the punctuation signs, and by the resultant syntax tree, a consensus has to be reached on the unique arbiter for each, including the syntax tree of a proposal (in whole or in part).

### Rules

1. The accepted English dictionary for words and concepts and their semantic linking shall be the latest version of The Princeton Wordnet. [http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/](http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/) with language option: English (eng). 
    
    The alternatives, in order (in their order of use when a source is unavailable):
    * 1.1. [http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/](http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/)
    * 1.2. [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn)
    * 1.3. https://en-word.net/(https://en-word.net/)

2. Any governance text may contain words with subscript that indicates the order of sense of the word as it appears in WordNet. For example:
> The chair<sub>3</sub> position is the most important.

refers to the third meaning of the word 'chair' from [http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/entity/eng/chair](http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/entity/eng/chair) : _(noun) the officer who presides at the meetings of an organization; 'address your remarks to the chairperson' chairman, chairwoman, chairperson, president, chair_

3. If concepts are not found in the source designated by point (1): Wikipedia may be used. [https://en.wikipedia.org/](https://en.wikipedia.org/)

4. The syntax tree source shall be [http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/) with its English option. 

     The alternatives, in order: 
     * 4.1. [http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/)
     * 4.2. [https://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/submit-sentence-4.html](https://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/submit-sentence-4.html)

### Meaning of the Decision

- if this proposal passes: the governance process gains additional legitimacy by recognizing prior consensus contained in the gov language itself

- if this proposal does not pass: the token holders forfeit the right to reject a proposal (on-chain or off-chain) on account of not being made using proper, verifiable English

#### Additional Benefits of Adopting
The subsequent proposals (on and off-chain) may be legitimately challenged on:

- the natural language used
- clarifying the meaning of a specific word
- sources of truth (such as a unique dictionary)
- syntax or semantic ambiguities

Only the chains that will pass proposals compatible with this one will have the legitimacy to enter common governance platforms for the InterChain. By this prop, we offered Evmos the opportunity to be the early leader in that respect.

"Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for March 2022)

## Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for March 2022)

Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8571-retroactive-payment-for-public-goods-evmos-development-for-march-2022](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8571-retroactive-payment-for-public-goods-evmos-development-for-march-2022)

Since [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88) has been rejected, the volunteers for Tharsis and Evmos will have the opportunity to ask the Evmos chain for clarification of the status of their efforts.

## Exposition

The for-profit developers of Tharsis were paid by salary for their development work. Then Tharsis extracted tens of millions of dollars from the apparent value of the Evmos chain to pay themselves again.

The Laurel Project which volunteered for Tharsis for developing a good portion of the Evmos chain tech and some Ethermint coding will also ask the Evmos Community if their efforts will be accepted in perpetuity as volunteering or if they will be paid as retroactive public goods funding.

## The Public Goods Created

* 22 Feb - 21 March 2022: ~359.5h
* Detailed list: [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/5a6aa821f7c22515b557f443c63de081e8a5700f/evmos/2.%20March_2022.md](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/5a6aa821f7c22515b557f443c63de081e8a5700f/evmos/2.%20March_2022.md)


## Proofs

* 1. The proof that the output of the effort exists as a public good: the videos exist and are public on YouTube, and the code exists and is public.
* 2. The proof that it is about the Evmos chain/tech: the code is used by Ethermint/Evmos.
* 3. The proof that the effort is of the quality and quantity claimed: Federico Kunze signed the confirmations for the effort, as a comment on [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2). The exact text was:
> I confirm and acknowledge the stated output. Thanks @loredanacirstea! 💯
> Federico Kunze Küllmer - CEO Tharsis Labs / Co-Founder Evmos
> Fri, Mar 25, 2022, by [@fedekunze](https://github.com/fedekunze)

but he recently deleted that comment (he deleted all his public confirmations of my volunteering).
* 4. The proof that this chain accepts claims for retroactive public goods is [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88).

## Retroactive Payment

* 359.5h * 255 EUR/h = 91,672.5 EUR
* current price: 0.265110 EUR/ $EVMOS

Total: 345,790 $EVMOS

## The Meaning of the Decision

* 1. If this proposal passes: the Evmos chain pays retroactively for this public good.
* 2. If this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain recognizes in perpetuity this public good as a volunteering effort of The Laurel Project in the interest of the Evmos Community. (or is bound to produce counter-proofs to the ones above). The presented effort was made with the intent of being offered to the Evmos Community as a volunteer effort. The legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort. 
* 3. No with veto: the chain benefits from and uses this free, unpaid effort, but it has decided to punish the author of this effort, for requesting formal recognition of the volunteered effort.

## Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers May Represent the Will of the Chain

Discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8698-governance-consensus-only-elected-officers-may-represent-the-will-of-the-chain](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8698-governance-consensus-only-elected-officers-may-represent-the-will-of-the-chain)

## Will Evmos Choose Its Own Executives?

If this proposal passes: Evmos governance decisions may be implemented by legitimate elected officers.

If this proposal does not pass: until the rejection is overturned, the Evmos chain may be represented by anybody and/or nobody.



## Advantages of Adopting

Non-exhaustive list of what is obtained, improved, or encouraged by passing this proposal:
- provide transparency of:
    - power structure
    - actions done for the benefit of the chain
- provide evidence of decentralization
- clarify the assignment of responsibility
- welcome cooperation with other chains
- obtain delegation of representation
- expand the types of actions the chain can govern
- legitimize legal representation
- legitimize officers using the chain itself (increased independence of legitimacy)


## Measures

* 1. Only officers elected by on-chain governance may implement the decisions of the chain in the name of the chain.
* 2. Offices must be concretely defined and created via on-chain governance before nomination and election of each respective office occurs. 
* 3. Officers must not exceed their jurisdiction (as defined by on-chain governance above).
* 4. Public and private communication channels, with open-door policies, must be concretely defined for each office.
* 5. All offices, their enacting officers and communication channels must be publicly available.

## Current State

"Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions

## Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions

Discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1042r2j/governance_consensus_no_criminal_decisions_evmos/

Previous discussion: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8616-governance-consensus-only-legal-decisions (today my CommonWealth account was banned, therefore the above Reddit thread is the discussion)

## Measures

The Evmos chain shall pass only decisions that are not criminal according to Criminal Law. By the Criminal Law, we understand the criminal code covered by International Law, Federal Law, EU Law, and the laws of the countries, states, and lands that have jurisdiction over the $EVMOS token holders.

## Meaning of the Decision

* if this proposal passes: the governance gains additional legitimacy by recognizing the rule of law
* if this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law

Only the chains that will pass proposals compatible with this one will have the legitimacy to enter common governance platforms for the InterChain. By this prop, we offered Evmos yet another opportunity to be the early leader in that respect.

"Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for 2022)

## Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for 2022)

Discussion: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1032uyo/retroactive_payment_for_public_goods_evmos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1032uyo/retroactive_payment_for_public_goods_evmos/)

Initial discussion was at: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8811-retroactive-payment-for-public-goods-evmos-development-for-2022](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8811-retroactive-payment-for-public-goods-evmos-development-for-2022), but [the post was hidden](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/raw/main/evmos/assets/evmos_volunteer_effort_thread_proof.png) and my account was banned (I cannot participate in Evmos Commonwealth governance).

## tl;dr

Same as [proposal 95](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/95), accounting for the rest of 2022.

Since [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88) has been rejected, the volunteers for Tharsis and Evmos will have the opportunity to ask the Evmos chain for clarification of the status of their efforts.

## Exposition

The for-profit developers of Tharsis were paid by salary for their development work. Then Tharsis extracted tens of millions of dollars from the apparent value of the Evmos chain to pay themselves again.

The Laurel Project which volunteered for Tharsis for developing a good portion of the Evmos chain tech and some Ethermint coding will also ask the Evmos Community if their efforts will be accepted in perpetuity as volunteering or if they will be paid as retroactive public goods funding.

## Proofs

* 1. The proof that the output of the effort exists as a public good: the videos exist and are [public on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos), and the code exists and is public.
* 2. The proof that it is about the Evmos chain/tech: the code is used by Ethermint/Evmos.
* 3. The proof that the effort is of the quality and quantity claimed: Tharsis signed the confirmations for the effort, as comments on:
  * [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/1](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/1)

* 4. The proof that this chain accepts claims for retroactive public goods is [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88).

## Retroactive Payment

372 + 391.3 + 376 + 26 + 3.5 + 524 + 313 + 290 + 304 = 2599.8

* 2599.8h * 255 EUR/h = 662,949 EUR
* current price: 0.424850 EUR/ $EVMOS

Total: 1,560,430 $EVMOS

## The Meaning of the Decision

* 1. If this proposal passes: the Evmos chain pays retroactively for this public good.
* 2. If this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain recognizes in perpetuity this public good as a volunteering effort of The Laurel Project in the interest of the Evmos Community. (or is bound to produce counter-proofs to the ones above). The presented effort was made with the intent of being offered to the Evmos Community as a volunteer effort. The legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort. 
* 3. No with veto: the effort will be considered either as charity to the ungrateful or/and as an acquisition of services by means of extorsion and unfulfilled promises.

## Exposition

In order to separate the governance process from levers of power that may delegitimize it, we propose a governance immunity for the active validators.

## Measures
### 1. Validators shall not be obstructed from doing their governance duties:
#### __1.1. vote in Governance
#### __1.2. create on-chain Proposals
#### __1.3. perform their duty to follow the governance process according to [prop #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83) or updated versions
##### ____1.3.1. create/edit their own proposals as discussions
##### ____1.3.2. comment on other proposals being discussed
##### ____1.3.3. answer to comments
### 2. While any active validator is banned or otherwise obstructed: no governance action should be performed save what is necessary to remedy this situation

## Meaning of the Decision

* if this proposal passes: the governance will be able to protect itself from outside interference
* if this proposal does not pass: any validator may be eliminated from the discussion or/and access to governance by off-chain means

Only the chains that will pass proposals compatible with this one will have the legitimacy to enter common governance platforms for the InterChain.

"Crescent External Incentives

Summary:

This proposal is to fund Evmos external incentives on Crescent. In order to spur initial TVL accumulation on Crescent DEX’s EVMOS/bCRE pair we request an allocation of 88,020 EVMOS(appx. 41,973 USD as of Feb 2nd) or 977 EVMOS/day from the Community Treasury to be utilized as farming incentives for the pair for 90 days.

Crescent has already incentivized EVMOS/bCRE as well as stEVMOS/EVMOS pair on Crescent DEX.

The funds will be managed by a multisig wallet at the address below, and includes the following members:

- LPX - Evmos Governance Workstream
- Glenn - PM, Crescent Foundation
- Provalidator - Evmos Validator

Weighted 3/4

Goals

In alignment with Crescent community demand, Crescent has proposed a Liquidity Driver Period of about 90 days at 6%(5,622 CRE / Day) of the farming allocation in CRE to the EVMOS/bCRE pair.

In addition, Crescent has incentivized stEVMOS / EVMOS pair at 468.6 CRE / day, which will allow EVMOS holders to swap between the two assets, negating unbonding times required. The liquidity amplification of the ranged pool will allow for very low slippage swaps compared to basic AMM.

"Evmos Testnet v12.0.0 Upgrade

## Description

### Author

Austin Chandra, Evmos Core Team

### Software upgrade being scheduled with this proposal

If successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [12252000](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/12252000) (around 4pm UTC Wed., 29th Mar. 2023) from its current version [v11.0.2](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v11.0.2) to [v12.0.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v12.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 120 hours.

### Motivation

By proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validate/upgrades).

### Impact

Evmos v12.0.0 contains the following changes and enhancements:

- Enable basic implementation of Fee Subscription to pay for transaction fees with unclaimed staking rewards
- Support multiple message schemas with EIP-712
- Remove Ethermint dependency by migrating relevant logic to the Evmos codebase to allow for quicker development iteration
- Restrict EVM module to work only with Evmos chain
- Upgrade Tendermint to [v0.34.26](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.26) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.46.10](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.10)
- Grant full amount of airdropped tokens to users affected by an airdrop [early decay bug](https://github.com/evmos/decay-analysis)
- Many small improvements and refactors

A full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v12.0.0).

### Testing

The Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.
On top of the upgrade tests, the Evmos team runs performance tests to monitor the impact of new versions.",0.5844759481595926
"Build a Decentralized Derivatives Exchange on EVMOS

## **Author:** 

Aaron: [Telegram](https://t.me/Abrahalacite) , Discord: Aaron #3578

See the past updates and active discussion on the forum [here](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/11422-proposal-to-build-a-decentralized-derivatives-exchange-on-evmos).

## **Project team member:**

**Patrick:** [STEPN](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/stepn)'s senior full-stack developer. Rich experience in Dapp development for EVM-based Chain and Solana Chain. please learn more stepn information on link above from binance.

**Linrz:** Wiredcraft, Lead Software Engineer.

**Richard**: Amazon, Full Stack Engineer.

**Shin:** Meta, Software Engineer.

**Aaron:** View Exchange business & product. joined crypto space since 2019, been ambassidor for few layer 1 project. An EVMOS community member since launch, EVMOS Telegram unofficial Chinese channel Mod + EVMOS Wechat Group Creator.

## **Summary:**

Introducing View Exchange - A decentralized derivatives exchange on EVMOS.

We believe EVMOS is the most powerful and efficient Layer 1 to provide users with a seamless trading experience. EVMOS's scalability, robustness, and compatibility with the EVM, make it an approprate soil for our Derivatives Exchange, ensuring fast and secure transactions. By leveraging EVMOS's advanced features, we aim to offer users a reliable and innovative trading platform that meets their needs while maximizing liquidity and minimizing costs.

By launching **FIRST Derivatives exchange** on EVMOS, View Exchange aims to attract more users and traders to the EVMOS ecosystem, which can result in greater liquidity and TVL. This can ultimately help create a more vibrant and robust DeFi ecosystem on EVMOS.

# **The exchange will have below features:**

- Decentralized Derivatives Exchange: traders can long/short an asset with Low Leverage initially to avoid high slippage, leverage will be set higher in the future when liquidity has met a certain threshold.
- Simple experience: trade directly from your wallet.
- Low fees: built on EVMOS with low gas fee.

## **Benefits to the Ecosystem:**

1. **Breaking Ecosystem barriers**: Remove the barriers that hinder derivative trading within the ecosystem, enabling more derivative traders to discover the Evmos and attract a greater number of traders.
2. **Crypto on-ramp**: with on-ramp solution integration, we simplify the process of acquiring and onboarding new users by providing them with a seamless method to convert fiat currency into EVMOS ecosystem assets. This will enhance accessibility and attract a larger user base.
3. **Greater Liquidity**: By launching a Derivatives exchange, we can attract a larger number of users and traders, which can result in greater liquidity. This will allow traders to execute larger orders without affecting the market price, resulting in a more efficient and reliable trading experience.
4. **Token Buybacks**: the revenue generated from the protocol will be used to buy back the tokens from the market & burn, in order to maintain the market confidence.

**If this proposal passed, the project development will be kick start immediately.**

## **Project Follow up:**

- A Project Progress Report will be released bi-weekly to the community.
- Communication channels will be always open to answer all the questions.

## **Tokenomics:**

- Token Name: View Exchange Tokens (VE)
- Max Supply: to be determined
- Initial Supply: 10% ( 5% airdrop + 5% incentives = 10% inital circulating supply)

Details of the tokenomics will be introduced close to the mainnet launch.

## **Allocation:**

**Airdrop and Incentives:**

To express gratitude for the community's efforts, we have allocated 10% of View Exchange Tokens (VE) as follows:

- Airdrop 5% of the tokens to EVMOS holders who have voted for this proposal.(yes, no, abstain)
- Allocate 5% of the tokens as incentives for protocol users and social task engagement platforms such as Galxe, Zealy, Rabbithole, Layer 3, etc., aiming to attract more users to experience the EVMOS ecosystem.
- We airdrop to those who voted for this proposal rather than the whole EVMOS addresses because we want to incentivize active participation in the EVMOS governance model. By limiting airdrop rewards to voters, we establish a mechanism where one's voice and opinion directly translate to clear benefits and rewards. This real incentive alignment optimizes for a governance system where the broadest range of EVMOS participants feel financially motivated to understand proposals, engage in debates, and ultimately vote to shape the protocol. Over multiple voting cycles, such an approach should yield increasingly representative outcomes as the community establishes a pattern of enthusiastic and knowledge-driven participation.
- Any unclaimed airdrop tokens will be recycled back to the community treasury for future expenditure.

**View Exchange Token (VE)**

- 50% to the community (via liquidity mining, trading rewards, trading competition, staking and more).
- 20% to community treasury.
- 20% to the Core Contributors vested linearly over 3 years.

**Note**: Above figures might be changed during implementation with community feedback.

**Token Utility:**

**Governance** **Voting**

The Protocol is governed and upgraded by VE holders and delegaters.

**Protocol Earning**

- 50% for Liquidity Providers in LP tokens
- 30% dedicated to VE buyback and burn
- 20% to the Core Contributors funds

The earnings to the Core Contributors funds will be exclusively used to cover the operation expenses. Every month, the unused amount will be reallocated towards Buyback and Burn.

**Derivatives Fee Discount**

VE holders get discount from 5% - 50% fees. (other fees still apply without discount to the opening positions).

## **Milestone-Based Fund Release:**

The allocated fund are held in a multisig wallet, ONLY the initial 10% funding to kickstart the project is paid immediately after this proposal is passed; all other payments are made upon the completion of each milestone. If there are any unexpected event happend from Developement i.e: (unable to deliver proposed function, not meet the expectation.) Multisig will have the **FULL RIGHT** to send the remaining funds back to the community pool.

**Kick Start - Immediately after this proposal has passed -  10%**

- Release upon passing the proposal to kick start the development

**Milestone 1 -  Local MVP - 10% - Time Frame: 1 - 1.5 month**

- A Local MVP will be developed and released to the community for feedback collection.
- Move to the next stage after improved based on community feedback.

**Milestone 2- Deploy Derivative exchange on Testnet - 40% - Time Frame: 3 - 4 Month**

- Deploy Derivatives on Testnet: during testnet phase, perpetual swaps function will roll out along with the development, for the community to test, give feedback, make improvements, until ready being on mainnet.
- Seeking Audit: after ready to move from testnet to the mainnet, we will send all the source to get auditted. - invoice for Audit will be present to the community.
- Marketing: started to build community, reach out all the social engagement platform, design a series tasks to attrack more users outside evmos ecosystem experiencing the exchange and evmos ecosystem dapps.

**Milestone 3- Deploy Derivative exchange on Mainnet - 40% - Time Frame: 1 - 2 Month**

- Deploy Derivatives on Mainnet: including all mentioned above.
- Marketing: including all mentioned above.
- Further Roadmap: will be decided by the community through on-chain governance.

**Bonos Milestones: - Keplr integration + on ramp + 3rd party bridge - 0%**

- Keplr integration: when keplr supports EVM we will integrate the wallet to the platform.
- Add on-ramp solution (currently aim c14.money) to the platform.
- Integrate one of the 3rd party bridge(celer/axlear/cypher) to the platform.

## **Funding Amount:**

This funding proposal will kick off the development for View Exchange. The amount requested will be $150,000 (*1,250,000 EVMOS)  to fund the project development.

- Should the value of EVMOS price decline, we commit to not seeking further funding in EVMOS to match the fiat value.

**Fund Usage Breakdown:**

We expect this funding will give us 6 months to finish the development, be audited and deploy on the mainnet.

 which can be break down as below:

- 60% - Exchange development (adding more people to the team, develop Perpetual, UI, Frontend, backend, smart contract, testing, infrustructure costs) 
- 13% - Marketing(campaines, community enagement, competition, ads, press release. etc.)
- 20% - Audit - before launching on mainnet, we will get exchange audited by a reputatable audit company. Getting audited will be critical to gain trust from users, especially users outside of the Evmos Ecosystem.
- 7% - Inital Liquidity to the exchange.
- The Audit invoice will be presented to the Multisig members before they release funds. If actual Audit costs are less than the estimated amount, the multisig can return unused funds to the Community Pool.

Set the minimum commission rate to 5%. 
 
 We have to build an healthier network : the competition to attract delegator is toxic and force others to lower their commission to attract people. We can agree on the fact that setting a minimum commission will justly reward contributors and avoid the validators spamming Juno Telegram channel and (0% fees).

"Juno Moneta Upgrade

# Juno Moneta Upgrade Proposal

This on-chain upgrade governance proposal, more commonly called Moneta, is to adopt junod v2.0.x. This will enable CosmWasm Smart Contracts on the Juno Mainnet, and will also add a number of updates, fixes and new modules.

# Background

Since our genesis on October 1st there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint. The following updates are included in junod v2.0.x:

* Adds wasmd and cosmwasm
* Fixes a bug with pinning contracts
* Enforces a minimum validator commission
* Ensures that new validators joining the set have to adhere to this
* Includes a wasmvm security patch
* Includes increase to cosmwasm default compile costs
* Version bump to 44.5 SDK
* Adds IBC proposal handler
* Enable Authz and Feegrant modules

# Validator Minimum Gas Price

With smart contracts enabled, it is even more important to set a minimum gas price for your node and validators. We suggest to set it at 0.025ujuno. This setting can be changed inside .juno/config/app.toml.

# Note

This is an experimental release, we strongly encourage all the community test the new feature as best they can before deploying sensitive dApps. 

# On-Chain Upgrade Process

When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of Juno will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. 

Cosmovisor is a tool that can help you with this process. There is a guide for setting it up [in the Juno docs](https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/setting-up-cosmovisor).

Validators can coordinate with each other on Discord in advance of the release. As the target block is more than 5 days away, changes in average block speed might change the target time.

We are aiming for 1600UTC on the 15th of December, but be aware that this block could arrive +/- 2 hours or more.

In this way we can upgrade the chain in one time and have both moneta-patch and security patch live as quickly as possible.

## Notes

1. v2.2.0 is consensus breaking against v2.1.0, so it's very important that super-majority of validators runs correct version.
2. Validators can follow the previousily shared instructions for the upgrade, but using the new version of the software.
3. This proposal will still be in voting period during and after the upgrade. This doesn't really affect the upgrade process, but in case of rejection of this proposal validators should coordinate to cancel the upgrade or run the previous agreed version of the software.

"Juno - Keplr Wallet Native Integration

After the successful mainnet launch and Moneta upgrade, Juno has become a critical part of the Cosmos ecosystem. In order to double down on Juno's presence in the ecosystem, being a natively integrated chain on Keplr Wallet is one of the best ways to increase the reach of Juno protocol to hundreds of thousands of interchain-native users.

Therefore, the Keplr development team requests an allocation of $360K (based on JUNO priced as $10.37 30d historical average daily close price according to Coingecko) from the Juno community pool for development, operations, and infrastructure for Keplr Wallet native integration.

The specific details are the following:

- Deliverable #1: Keplr extension native integration
- Juno listed as a native chain on Keplr extension
- Node operation support
- Provide Staking & Governance interface, infrastructure operations

- Deliverable #2: Keplr mobile support
- Juno listed as a native chain on Keplr mobile
- Node operation support
- Provide Staking & Governance interface

Details:

Keplr will guarantee a minimum of 12 months of native integration support for Juno on Keplr Extension and Mobile. Payment will be under 1-year linear vesting.

By listing Juno on Keplr wallet, the team expects the enriching impact of Juno on the Cosmos ecosystem and helping users to easily use JUNO for staking and governance.

"Correcting the gamed stakedrop

# Correcting the gamed stakedrop - Proposed by Core-1 after numerous discussions with the community.

By voting yes on this proposal you agree to reduce the gamed whale address to 50k  (Whalecap that was originally set per entity prior to genesis).

**Note:** The facts are that the Juno genesis stakedrop was gamed by a single entity. Willingly or unwillingly is not relevant to this matter.
The whale gamer poses a growing risk to the network and the stakedrop error may be corrected. 
Gamed funds were consolidated into 1 address right after genesis which proves that 1 entity had custody over all addresses (linked below). 
This considerably broke the stakedrop rules of having a max 50k ATOM : 50k JUNO per entity. 
At the time of the genesis stakedrop there was no way for Core-1 to pro-actively counter act this behavior. 
If this information would have been known prior to launch, 51/52 of those addresses would have been removed entirely.

## Risks of doing nothing

* High risk to on-chain governance (already has half of quorum)
* Potential of buying validators with delegations in order to bribe them away from acting
* Whale gamer can single handedly wipe out the entire DEX liquidity in 10 min or less (Should his funds be unbonded)
* Fear in the community on a daily basis

## Order of operations

1. Upgrade 
2. Remove funds from whale gamer acct https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8

"Unity Proposal

# Unity Proposal

This proposal follows the Commonwealth discussion [here](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/4102-prop-17-unity-win-win-win).

**TL;DR:**

- CCN was ineligible for the Juno stakedrop
- Prop 16 signalled the community wished to act and remove:
    - CCN's concentrated voting power
    - CCN's disproportionate token ownership

## Stakedrop Remediation Implementation

The  stakedrop goal was to create a community-led smart contract platform free from centralization of power. Specifically with the essence of preventing top heavy on-chain governance control.Therefore, the  stakedrop targeted non custodial wallets only with the exclusion of centralized custodians ie. Exchange validators and their delegators.

 Shortly after genesis, the contents of multiple wallets were drained into a single wallet.

Proposal 16 was submitted and suggested to reclaim all but 50K . The community broadly supported the proposal, and so the owner of the address added a link to an article in the memo of theirAbstain vote.

After this first statement, a second statement revealed the identity of the whale, and the nature of the business, as crypto asset exchange service.

Hence, CCN was ineligible for the stakedrop.

By voting yes on this proposal you agree CCN should not have received the genesis stakedrop.

By voting yes on this proposal you agree that a software upgrade should be made which adjusts CCN's balance held at juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8:

- By undelegating all of CCN's current delegations
- By instantly unbonding all of CCN's recovered delegations (bypassing the normal 28-day unbonding period)
- By sending all of CCN's recovered and available balance to a [smart contract](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/cw-unity-prop/tree/v0.3.0) controlled by the community

By voting yes on this proposal you agree that the final decision of action to be taken should be made by the community once the funds are in a community controlled smart contract.

By voting no you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements.

## Upgrade

This upgrade to Juno v4.0.0 will take place at block **2951100**, which should arrive around **1600UTC on May the 4th**, but be aware that this block could arrive +/- 2 hours or more.

"Community Spend Proposal for Creation of Terra Developer Fund

# Community Spend Proposal for Creation of Terra Developer Fund

In the last few days, the Terra CosmWasm-based smart contract network has suffered a potentially catastrophic attack. Though the full implications are unclear, there is likely irreversible damage to Terra's user and developer base.

The Juno Network consists of a strong community of passionate users and developers, and like Terra shares the mindset that the true value of a network lies in the protocols and applications built upon it. This proposal is an endeavor to enable Terra developers to continue building and innovating. Furthermore, this aims to be a lifeline for their existing users to continue to benefit from these developers’ platforms.

Several Terra projects have reached out and expressed interest in migrating to and developing on Juno Network. It is expected that many more innovative projects and teams will follow with the passing of this proposal. 

## Background

On May 9th, 2022 the Terra chain appears to have suffered a financial attack that resulted in the insolvency of the network, and a crash in both UST and LUNA. 

The combined market cap of LUNA/UST prior to the attack was in excess of 39.1 billion dollars. There are many hugely successful CosmWasm applications on Terra. These applications and protocols will need a home going forward. 

Juno, as a firmly established CosmWasm chain, can provide a platform and considerable community support for these developers to continue building their projects - a new home. 

This will also benefit Juno by bringing in a wave of new users, developers and applications.

## Proposed Use of Funds

The Community Fund contains roughly 16,248,583 JUNO, or approximately $75,880,883 in USD equivalent / €72,845,647 in EUR equivalent at the time of writing.

This proposal would allocate a total of 1,000,000 JUNO (700,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool & 300,000 JUNO from the Juno Development Fund) to a Terra Developer Fund Multi-sig for project migration and continued development in the Juno ecosystem. It is worth approximately $4,670,000 in USD equivalent / €4,483,647 EUR equivalent at the time of writing.

Via governance, the funding could be further expanded with additional disbursements, if development accelerates, or returned back to the respective community and developer fund pools from the Multi-sig, if development wanes. A proposal will be put up 60 days from the passing of this proposal to decide.

## Proposed Management of Funds

If this proposal passes, 1 million total JUNO will be sent to the treasury of a newly-formed Terra Developer Fund Multisig on DAODAO. Multi-sig members can vote on project funding on a case-by-case basis.

The Multi-sig will be structured as a 5 of 9 Multi-sig managed by:

The Juno Hacker’s lounge will be a great place for developers/talents to network and connect. In close coordination with the Core-1 team, we will make the best use of the Hacker’s lounge.

Description:

Cosmoverse 2022 is a community-organized conference that will take place in Medellín, Colombia on September 26-28, 2022 (3 Day Event)

Our goal is to unite the Cosmos community from all across the globe and get them into one room with leading Cosmos builders. Around the main conference days, we will organize side-events, workshops, and afterparties, which will extend Cosmoverse into a week-long experience.
We expect around 1,000 attendees, with the majority coming from Latin American countries - a huge market in the crypto ecosystem.

Cosmoverse keeps a strong community spirit. There won’t be any VIP areas or exclusive sections. Attendees will have direct access to Cosmos thought leaders and core developers.

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

Where do the funds go?

- Conference venue
- F&B (conference + afterparty)
- Marketing and communications
- Production, audio and visuals
- Operational & logistical costs
Legal

The current cost for the 3-day event already exceeds $300k. Receiving support from the Juno community would contribute tremendously to ensuring that Cosmoverse will be a great success.

How does it benefit the Juno community?

By allocating 15,000 Juno from the community pool to the Cosmoverse team, Juno will become the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum. Besides, the Juno community will have an exclusive 200sqm Hacker’s lounge for all conference days (that no other project has), and can fit 150 people.

- 2 Keynote speeches: If this proposal passes, we offer two keynote slots to the Juno core team (usually it’s only one keynote per project). We will keep you updated on this topic on the official Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website.
- Hacker’s Lounge: We will provide Juno with their own Hacker’s lounge, where developers can play around with CosmWasm tech, hack and earn bounties, learn, and build cool stuff. The Juno Hackers lounge is a great place for developers and talents to network and connect.
- Booth in networking area: We provide the Juno community with their own booth stand in the main networking area at the conference - a 2.5m x 2.5m exhibition stand with LCD screen and branding banners.
- Marketing: Marketing plans including (paid SM marketing, and on ground marketing leading up to the event) to attract local developers and crypto enthusiasts to come to the event and learn more about Cosmoverse and Juno.
- Merchandise: Exclusive Juno merchandise, made for 500+ attendees, we will be collaborating with merch venders from the Juno Community as well as others.

"Juno Multiverse Upgrade

# Juno Multiverse Upgrade

**TL;DR**

It's time for Juno to enter the multiverse.

We propose an upgrade to Juno v7.0.0, with code-name multiverse at block [3851750](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/blocks/3851750). This upgrade will enable ICA Host functionality on Juno.

## Context

Inter Chain Accounts (ICA) represent one of the biggest technical changes in the Cosmos since IBC, and we believe it is important include this functionality in the chain.

Juno is the 'hub' for CosmWasm Smart Contracts in the Cosmos, and so it follows that being a Host Chain for Inter Chain Accounts makes sense.

This upgrade will allow Controller Chains to interact with Juno functionality, including:

* Native functionality and core SDK modules
* Smart Contract store
* Smart Contract instantiate
* Smart Contract execute
For more information on Inter Chain Accounts:

* Cosmos [blog post](https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-accounts-take-cosmos-interoperability-to-the-next-level-39c9a8aad4ad)
* Cosmos [FAQs](https://blog.cosmos.network/faqs-about-interchain-accounts-b404f1bb9ca2)
_Note that this is ICA Host functionality only, and does not enable Controller functionality._

The release candidate for this upgrade is [on the Juno GitHub here](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/releases/tag/v7.0.0), and contains a changelog for this release.

## Voting

By voting **YES** on this proposal, you agree that:

* The Juno Multiverse upgrade should proceed
* Juno should adopt Inter Chain Accounts
* Juno should become an ICA Host Chain
A future upgrade will be brought forward for ICA Controller functionality if and once that becomes desirable.

"Increase Governance Proposal Minimum Deposit

# Proposal Deposit Concept :-
* For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be submitted with a deposit of the amount defined by the **min_deposit** param in the governance module before the deposit end time.
* A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.
* The proposer account is only required to deposit **1 JUNO**.

# Deposit Refund and Burn Concept :-
* If the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount.
* If the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4%) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.

# Proposition :-
By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit costs **500 JUNO** or approximately **1,500** in **USD** equivalent, which currently appears to be inadequate at preventing spam proposals. Historically, the cost of submitting a governance proposal into voting period has been much higher to deter spam proposals.

With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to **1000 JUNO** or approximately **3,000** in **USD** equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance.

# Voting :-
* By voting **YES**, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 500 JUNO to 1000 JUNO.
* By voting **NO**, you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements.
* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
* By voting **NOWITHVETO**, you seek penalizing the proposal depositors by burning their deposit of 500 JUNO, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold, which would result in proposal failure if reached.

"Increase Validator Set to 150

# Increase Validator Set to 150

With the recent growth of Juno Network, we have seen a great deal of development and newcomers entering the space, with many new community members and validators wishing to participate as active validators. Currently the floor to become an active validator is quite high, at nearly 47,700 JUNO or approximately $168,000 USD.

As of right now, there is currently a number of validators sitting just outside the active set who have also been active historically, with many more waiting for a set expansion to join in consensus. A more diverse set of validators brings new ideas into the space, new viewpoints in governance and often leads to new innovation and development for the chain.

As with all set expansions, it is possible that expanding the set could have a small effect on the overall block times taking longer, as more validators will be required to achieve consensus. After reviewing analysis of previous set expansions, these effects appear negligible upon block times during that period, but it is important to communicate clearly both the pros and cons of any parameter change to the network.

## Decentralization of Stake

Set expansions are not a perfect science, and in reviewing that same analysis provided by some other talented validators, we have seen that historically these expansions don't always lead to further decentralization of stake on their own. 

We hope that delegators will take the opportunity of this set expansion to **rebalance their stake** from the top of the active set to competent validators lower on the list.

Balancing your stake **outside the top 10 to 20 validators** on the network is the best way to assist in this initiative, as we work together as a community to improve the voting power balance on Juno even further.

## Best Practices

We also strongly encourage new validators entering the set to avoid behavior such as **NFT giveaways**, **validator specific snapshots** or **commission refunds/rebates** which circumvent the 5 percent minimum commissions as established by [Juno Network Prop 3](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/3).

Equally we recommend that delegators and investors avoid participating in these activities if they see them, and instead find strong validators which respect and follow the parameters of the network as they were established through the governance, by the community. Keep your stake safe by choosing technically competent validators.

## Vote

By voting **YES** to this proposal, you agree to change the MaxValidators parameter from 135 to 150, allowing 15 new validators to enter the set.

By voting **NO** to this proposal, you disagree with increasing the validator set and prefer keeping the current MaxValidator value of 135.

By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their 500 JUNO deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.

"Komple Framework, KompleJS & Marketplace Builder Proposal

This is a heavily truncated version of the Komple Framework, KompleJS & Marketplace Builder Proposal. 

Please read the full length IPFS proposal [here](https://bafybeiftfnekil5tcru5zohydiwfoz3yzzgqtvhj3id6tbj6b3jch3ri7i.ipfs.nftstorage.link). 

# Introduction 

We at Komple have experience working with wasm smart contracts and are committed to pushing the technology to its limits. 

With Komple, we aim to utilize the potential of Juno Network and CosmWasm by developing new open-source tools for NFT based applications, making them more accessible to the community. 

# Komple Framework & KompleJS 

View documentation [here](https://docs.komple.io). 
Make sure to check out our documentation website for more in-depth information. 

Komple Framework is a smart contract framework developed with CosmWasm to build out NFT based applications. 

Containing different modules such as merge module, dynamic metadata module, p2p swap module and even accommodating custom modules developed by the community, Komple Framework gives developers the tools they need to bring their projects to life. 

With KompleJS, developing Javascript applications is easier than ever. It is tightly integrated with Komple Framework releases. 

# Community-Centric Marketplace Builder 

Our community-centric marketplace builder allows for projects to build and configure their own marketplaces without needing to touch a single line of code. 

We call this tool Marbu. 

Marbu allows DAOs, projects and individuals to shape their projects based on their custom needs. 

With the use of modularity and contract interactions made possible by the Komple Framework, all projects within Marbu will have the ability to collaborate, scale up and put creativity first. 

While having the tools for such things, projects and Juno community will also benefit from the secondary sale fees - extracting the value they are bringing. 

Simply, Marbu aims to be the home of NFT based applications on Juno Network. 

# Project Timeline 

Komple is asking for a total of 320K USD from Juno community. This is to be released gradually, based on projects development and milestone progress. 

The milestone system enables a social contract between us and the Juno community. We need to prove ourselves at each milestone. 

At the time of this proposal going live, 320K USD is equal to 65440 JUNO. 

We've split this process into 4 milestones. 

## Milestone 1: 
**Time: 2 months - 80K USD** 

Initial 40K USD released immediately for kickstarting operations. 

Remaining 40K USD will be taken after completing these points: 

* Having v1.0.0 of Komple Framework. Hub, Mint, Token, Metadata, Marketplace, Whitelist, Merge, and Permission modules. 
* Having Marbu initial website designs ready to build. 
* Having Komple Framework testing website designs. 

## Milestone 2: 
**Time: 2 months - 80K USD** 

*Having v1.0.0 of KompleJS based on v1.0.0 of Komple Framework. 
Having a live Komple Framework testing website for developers, ready to test out applications built with Komple Framework. 
Starting the Marbu website development. 

## Milestone 3: 
**Time: 1 month - 80K USD** 

* Having the beta version for Marbu website deployed on testnet. 
* Having the incentivized bug bounties on Marbu website. 

## Milestone 4: 
**Time 1 month - 80K USD** 

* Finishing the Marbu website and successfully deploying on mainnet.

"Decrease per block gas limit

## Reduce Maximum Gas

**max_gas** is a parameter which defines the maximum total gas allowed for each block.

It is important to set the value of the parameter suitably to balance between the transaction amount per block and the computational load on the validator nodes.

"Creation of the Grow Juno SubDAO

# Grow Juno SubDAO

The Juno community's Terra Developer Fund has achieved its purpose. Since the passing of the Terra Developer Fund Proposal, 18 projects have pulled themselves from the wreckage of the Terra collapse and found a new home on Juno. In this process of delivering aid to Terra projects, we noticed that Terra developers aren't the only ones who could use a little help. There are many new projects building on Juno, or who wish to build on Juno, that could benefit from community support.

The rapid ascent of projects on Juno has been fantastic, but in an increasingly competitive landscape, we must maintain this momentum and drive growth sustainably for the long term. We can now do this with the Growth Fund, one led by community members, operated transparently, and owned by Juno governance. We now have the time and opportunity to build up the ideal form of this DAO. We must have more human resources, diverse views, and representatives from the community - as well as a means to collaborate with outside capital partners to participate alongside the Juno Community in funding these protocols. The projects built in this bear market will define Juno's future as a leader in the Cosmos, a home for projects and protocols, and a community-driven incubator for the CosmWasm interchain.

This proposal would transition the Terra Developer Fund into an official Grow Juno SubDAO. This proposal aims to expand the membership to include members from the community with professional investing experience, analyst skill sets and valuable business acumen. As a community initiative, we are purposefully aiming to have less representation from Core-1, and stronger representation from experts within the community.

This proposal will expand upon Proposal 23 by extending the scope beyond Terra migrations to include all new projects and investments conducive to the growth and development of Juno, to bring more value to Juno holders as a whole, as well as new investment opportunities which expand the Juno's Community Pool and make it a sustainable resource for continued growth and community endeavors. 

The [Terra Developer Fund Treasury](https://legacy.daodao.zone/multisig/juno1lgnstas4ruflg0eta394y8epq67s4rzhg5anssz3rc5zwvjmmvcql6qps2) will be transferred to the Grow Juno SubDAO and will seed the initial SubDAO treasury.

## Creation of SubDAO

If passed, an official SubDAO will be created so that the Juno community maintains control of the SubDAO itself, and its associated treasury.

At the time of Prop 23 passing, the DAODAO SubDAO system was not available. Now that it is available, it is a much better setup than a normal multisig and with DAODAO V2 on the way, this will only make SubDAOs more effective.

**Some key benefits are:**

- Community control of SubDAO membership.
- Community control of SubDAO treasury.
- Formalization of the purpose of this SubDAO: To grow the overall ecosystem and bring in new capital.
- Control from the community to return funds to the Community Pool, if it deems necessary.
- Control from the community to add or remove members and the entire SubDAO, if it deems necessary.

**Specific mandates:**

1) The Grow Juno SubDAO will seek community approval (through on-chain signaling proposal) for any grants above k to any single entity.

2) The Grow Juno SubDAO will actively seek out projects and investments which can contribute strong token swaps and/or obvious profits to the Community Pool, and will always aim to take actions which maintain the sustainability of the fund for the Juno community. In some cases, public goods may be funded, subject to the same limitations as above, insofar as they unlock key functionality for promising new protocols, (i.e. oracles, infrastructure partners, indexing, protocol code audits, etc)

3) The Grow Juno SubDAO Treasury is subject to the control of the entire community. The community has the ability to cancel any outstanding funding and/or return funds to the community pool, at any time through governance, for any reason.

4) The Grow Juno SubDAO membership will be established by governance, and will be maintained and changed using DAO voting, as necessary to accommodate and adjust its membership to the needs of the Juno Community. At any time, on-chain governance can override membership, as with all SubDAOs.

5) As the membership is expanding, it's important to mandate that, where notable conflicts of interest may occur, members are expected to vote to abstain and recuse themselves. Simply being an investor in a project shall not be deemed to be a conflict of interest.

6) The Grow Juno SubDAO will encourage and assist protocols in seeking additional supplementary funding with outside capital and funding partners to lower the risk of funding issuance by the Juno community, and will help to bring in new capital to the ecosystem through venture partners.

7) Being an investor in projects is encouraged, and many of the venture investors working alongside the DAO can and should take on the risk of investing in protocols coming into the ecosystem. This must be encouraged to spread risk/benefit amongst numerous entities, and not place the burden of protocol funding solely upon the Juno community. Investments shall be disclosed by members publicly.

8) Members of the DAO should be paid modestly while proving their own continued effectiveness and the viability of the subDAO, but well enough to put in the hours required to achieve the goals of the subDAO. This will be implemented sustainably by staking a portion of the treasury so that funding is not depleted over time.

9) These mandates can be changed only through SubDAO membership voting on DAODAO, in a manner fully visible to the Juno community.

**The membership of this SubDAO is proposed to be as such:**

6 of 11 required for funding approval

- Kevin Garrison (Oni Validator + Juno Biz Dev)
- Maxjuno (Community Outreach + DAO Coordination)
- Pupmos (Technical Expertise, Validator)

"Implement a fee-sharing mechanism

## TL;DR
Implement a fee-sharing mechanism, where half of the transaction fee of a smart contract execution will go to the contract’s recipient address which is defaulted to the creator address, and the other half will go to stakers as per usual.
The proposed mechanism can potentially become a permanent incentive source for developers based on the raised user activity, in the form of executions, towards their developed smart contract.
## Introduction
Junø is the go-to smart contract zone in the ecosystem, due to its permissionless interoperability and lively community.
One of the main keys to grow and expand the core value of a smart contract platform is reflected by the applications and projects built on it, besides to the developers/contributors.
Therefore, we intend to seek ways and methods to attract healthy development on Junø and promote the effectiveness behind adopting our platform to launch web3 applications. Such methods included offering grants, Hack Juno rewards, or community-pool based funding approved via governance.
But what if the chain offered built-in incentives for development on Junø? Will it attract further development and contributors to begin landing on Junø?
## Contributor Fee-Based Incentives
The proposed solution is constructed around rewarding developers based on the overall user interest in what has been developed, which is potentially a longterm continuous reward.
For each smart contract, there will be a fee recipient address which is defaulted to the creator address.
The fee split parameter would be configurable via governance. As of now, we propose a 50/50% split.
For each transaction which executes the smart contract, 50% of the transaction fee is distributed to the fee recipient address. The remaining 50% is distributed to stakers.
This mechanism allows developers to be fairly rewarded as long as their development is raising activity and users are transacting with their smart contract. Fee distribution will not require voting or permission, and acts as longterm potential revenue, which can attract more developers to build on Junø.
## How Contributor Incentives can commend DAOs
One of the optimistic outcomes will be the integration between DAO treasuries and on-chain smart contracts, where the treasury address can be the contract’s fee recipient address to receive fee-based incentives.
For example, JunoSwap can set the RAW DAO treasury as the contributor address, where 50% of the fees collected by JunoSwap transactions will be automatically received by the RAW DAO.
## Postscript
This is a signaling proposal to evaluate the community’s interest in the proposed “Contributor Fee-Based Incentives” mechanism. Accordingly, the dev team will begin working on the implementation.
The proposed mechanism will not reduce or exclude the presence of other incentive programs such as Hack Juno, grants, or governance-approved funding.

Anyone can apply to be part of the Communications SubDAO using the appropriate section on commonwealth.

## Funding

The SubDAO will be initially funded with around 20,000~ JUNO from the previous marketing multi-sig, and will ask for additional funding from the community pool when needed.

Funds will be spent on the following:

- Pay salaries of full-time and part-time people working on this

- Pay eventual outsourcing work or external partners

- Allocate to community-incentivized events

- All of the activities described under “Objectives” above.

Core Root members or people with salary from other SubDAOs or other Juno Entities will not get a double salary from this and will participate only for decision-making or as guarantee to the SubDAO good faith.

Quarterly reports will be shared with the community as a recap of operations and results.

## Deployment

In accordance with [Prop 25](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/25), the SubDAO Multisig contract will be instantiated by this governance vote with the Juno community DAO as admin. This means the community can execute messages on behalf of the subDAO via a governance proposal, recall funds back to the community pool, upgrade the contract, or add / remove members.

The Communications subDAO will operate while abiding by the principles defined in [Prop 25](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/25).

Note, the address of the Juno governance module and community pool is [juno1jv65s3grqf6v6jl3dp4t6c9t9rk99cd83d88wr](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1jv65s3grqf6v6jl3dp4t6c9t9rk99cd83d88wr).

Juno community will have full visibility of the subDAO spending using DAODAO interface.

No community pool funds are requested at this stage.

"Implement Price Oracle on Juno

# Implement Price Oracle on Juno

This is a signaling proposal regarding the implementation of an on-chain Price Oracle to Juno.

Commonwealth Proposal and Discussions can be seen [here](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7325-oracle) and [here](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7751-implement-price-oracle-on-juno).

### Pros

- A Price Oracle supports many DeFi use cases that are currently difficult (or impossible) to implement on Juno. Many major DeFi protocols depend upon decentralized price feeds to function correctly. This is a rapid solution to provide that functionality.
- Currently, projects on Juno wanting to access price feeds have to pay excessive fees to access these feeds, which can be prohibitive for a start-up.
- Implementing a Price Oracle on Juno natively would give Juno (and the community) control over this public good.
- Even if better solutions come along, this is a rapidly implementable stop-gap solution that can be deployed. Future oracles and providers may improve upon this service.
- Juno would be the first *permissionless* CosmWasm chain with an on-chain Price Oracle, which is a valid differentiator for builders seeking to deploy DeFi protocols in a permissionless environment.

### Cons

- Validators will have to run additional software to ensure the price oracle is decentralized. Failure to do so will result in soft-slashing, so Juno stakers and validators face a non-zero risk of soft-slashing. Soft-slashing is set at 0.01% on Juno. *(The slashing window is an adjustable parameter and will be set conservatively at first to allow validators to gain software familiarity.)*
- Some blockchains have already added price oracles, though none are permissionless. This is a solution that exists on chains such as Kujira and Umee.
- Oracle TX fees have to be paid from a common pool, and ultimately there is a cost to the community for those tokens.

## Voting

- Vote **YES** if you\'d like Juno to implement this Price Oracle solution as per the above.
- Vote **NO** if you don\'t want Juno to implement this Price Oracle solution as per above.
- By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote for or against the proposal.
- Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",0.0254081939374039

"Loop Finance - Juno Terra Developer Grant Final Tranche Payment

# Loop Finance - Juno Terra Developer Grant Final Tranche Payment

**Important Note: Text from this proposal is heavily shortened to accomodate the max character limit for a proposal on-chain. Please review and refer to the full text which is available in the commonwealth discussion page linked here:** 

**https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/7655-loop-finance-juno-tdf-final-tranche-payment**

## **TL;DR**

Now that we are 5/6 of the way through our Terra Development Fund grant, The TDF have asked Loop to poll the community to make sure you still want to grant us the final 1/6th of the funding previously approved through the Juno Terra Developer Fund.

Below you can find a comprehensive list of what we promised to deliver versus what we have delivered and what will be finished by the end of our funding period (6 months).

**NOTE:** A vote **YES**, means our grant is to be delivered as originally promised to gain community\'s approval of final Terra Developer Fund grant tranche payment to allow Loop to continue development on the Juno blockchain and play an active role in Juno\'s future.

A vote, NO means the final tranche of funding comitted will no longer be delivered.

***

## Purpose of this Proposal

This proposal provides the opportunity for Loop to clearly showcase what we have achieved for the Juno community in the past 5 months, provide details on our forward plan, confirm the final tranche of grant payment and advise the community that we now transferred 1 percent of LOOP tokens to the Juno community fund as per our original agreement.

## Background

When the Terra Developer Fund grant was confirmed by the Juno team, Loop created a comprehensive strategy to get back up to speed in a short period of time despite a bear market.

### 1. Build: Jun 22 + Jul 22 (2 months)
* Build fast and integrate with Juno

* Airdrop  to Juno stakers                        - Completed
* LOOP to Juno Community Fund      - 12M LOOP sent (~336k USD)

**Total 1.4M over 6 months**

**Final tranche payment remaining: 233K**

## Detailed Product Updates

At Loop we launch MVP products into beta after internal testing. Anyone who has launched software products is aware that this model is widely accepted as the best approach to building the best applications. It allows iterative improvement based on community feedback so that we end up building the best product for the community, rather than the best one we think the community wants.

### Loop Chain Long Term Goals & Mesh Security
### 
Loop\'s long term plan is to eventually launch our own chain. We can foresee a long and happy relationship with Juno, including an airdrop of Loop Chain tokens to Juno stakers, the application of mesh security between Juno and Loop, and many other collaborations, if this proposal goes ahead.

Launching our own chain would not mean that we would abandon Juno. We would continue to deploy the same products across both chains, connect to protocols on both chains, offer both chains in our mobile wallet, etc. Our long term goal is to be connected to many chains, providing a bridge between multiple ecosystems and protocols.

The more we can expand the adoption and growth of Loop, the more the Juno community will benefit, as both the Juno Community wallet and Juno members are all LOOP token holders thanks to our airdrop.

### Loop to Open-Source Code
### 
**Please note:** It is Loop\'s intention to open-source all of our smart contract code in a 3-6 month timeframe, after it has passed rigorous internal testing & 3rd party validation by a well established auditing firm, the results of which will be shared with the community.

## Voting

- Vote YES if you\'d like Loop to receive their final grant tranche as per above.
- Vote NO if you don\'t want Loop to receive their final grant tranche as per above.
- Vote ABSTAIN to express no opinion on the matter. 
- Vote NOWITHVETO to cause this proposal to fail if 1/3 of voters also choose veto.  In the event of a veto, depositors\' deposits will be burned.

"Sunset Liquditiy Incentives for JunoSwap

# Sunset Liquditiy Incentives for JunoSwap

The prop 14 multi-sig currently has 1 Million (Roughly 2~ Million $) Juno in funds left in the multi-sig.

Prop 14 originally assigned 3 Million Juno to the incentivization multi-sig in order help booststrap the first AMM on Juno ie. JunoSwap.

JunoSwap has been bootstrapped and it is now time to better make use of the remaining funds in order to amplify liquidity on its major pairs across Cosmos, enabling better interoperability and collaboration with other projects.

By approving this proposal all the incentives for pools JUNO/ATOM JUNO/RAW JUNO/USDC will be interrupeted, and funds will stay in the multisig until new direction from community and waiting for other Dex protocols to deploy.

## Timeline

Incentives on JUNO/RAW will be stopped December 12th

Incentives on JUNO/USDC and JUNO/ATOM will be stopped January 1st

## What can I do with my liquidity if proposal passes?

- Continue providing liquidity on Junoswap and earn  rewards + Swap Fees

- Unbond your liquidity, wait the unbonding time, and move it to Osmosis or any other DEX to earn their rewards + Swap Fees

- Migrate your LP tokens onto WYND DEX in accordance to the migration plan, no unbonding required. More info [here](https://medium.com/wynddao/junoswap-liquidity-migration-plan-by-wynd-dao-5478d64563d9).

"Formalise usage of Commonwealth for governance

Most proposals go through Commonwealth for review and discussion before arriving on chain. This allows community members to engage with the proposers to understand and provide input and feedback before the proposal is submitted on chain. However, some proposals do not go through Commonwealth, which can lead to proposals arriving on chain that could have been discussed and improved before arriving on chain.

This proposal is to formalise the usage of Juno Commonwealth ( https://commonwealth.im/juno ) for all Juno proposals for a minimum of 3 days before being submitted for a vote on chain.

"Juno Open Source Funding Policy

This proposal is intended to supersede [Prop #59](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/59) should it pass.

We propose the following rules related to ALL funding decisions by EVERY Juno funding body:

- Projects receiving funding and deploying smart contracts on chain MUST open source their smart contracts *before* they are deployed on mainnet.
- Wallet projects where users store their private keys and interact with the chain MUST be open source to receive funding.

These requirements exist to protect users. If the conditions for open source compliance are not met, all funding for the project should be immediately halted. Once open source requirements are met, outstanding funding will be provided as previously agreed.

Existing contracts before this proposal and Prop #59 will still be honored.

Furthermore these additional rules shall apply to the stated SubDAOs:

- Core One (a.k.a Juno Development fund) may only fund projects where *every component* is open source.
- Hack Juno SubDAO may only fund projects where *every component* is open source.

Moreover, as a chain built entirely on public goods, we emphasize that all Juno funding should prioritize projects that are entirely open source.

"Increase Community Tax

Juno was built as a 100% community driven initiative Without any VCs funds backing it that means it has to rely on the community pool for funding the Development on the network. Currently only 2% of the inflation is going towards the community Pool, which is a very negligible amount.

In order to continue funding development and have a Sustainable Ecosystem Juno requires a strong treasury/community Pool. This proposal requests to Increase the current community tax from 2% to 10% until at least the next halving which will result in the following benefits:

- Reduction of some part of the daily sell pressure on the Juno token because the inflation going towards stakers will decrease by 8%. The apr of staking Juno would fall from 39.91% to roughly around ~36.66%.

- The community pool would increase roughly by ~1.5million Juno (instead of ~300k Juno with the current tax) till the next halving.If this becomes a permanent change then the community pool would increase by ~9.2 million Juno in total (instead of ~1.8 million Juno with the current tax) till the end of the Juno’s 12 year inflation period.

- A stronger Community Pool will enable Juno community to conduct L1 to L1 swaps Which will enable Juno to have a diversified treasury.

- With a Larger community pool we will be able to use Juno tokens to have protocol owned Liquidity which will remove the need for Providing inflationary external incentives , which also affects the token price in a negative way, for Deep liquidity in Juno Pools.

## Drawback of not increasing community tax

If Juno community pool doesn’t have any funds flowing into it right now it might end up in similar position like Cosmos hub in a few years ,where only $13 million out of the $3.2 billion chain valuation sit in the community pool which is around 0.4% of the current total supply.

# **TL:DR:**
 BitCanna has released a payment plugin for the Cosmos-ecosystem for WooCommerce and Prestashop.
In this plugin JUNO is enabled as payment method, offering a possibility for webshops to start accepting JUNO as a means of payment. Community support is vital in our opinion, which is why we want to ask the approval of the Juno community to have JUNO enabled in the plugin with this proposal.
* Vote Yes if you are in favor of having JUNO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay
* Vote No if you don’t want JUNO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay

## Details
### Who is BitCanna?
BitCanna has been found by and for the cannabis industry. It aims to provide a secure and efficient way for businesses and consumers to transact using blockchain technology to create a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions, enabling fast and secure payments without the need for intermediaries. The platform also includes a range of tools and services for merchants, such as point-of-sale systems and financial management tools. With BitCanna, the cannabis industry can benefit from the advantages of digital currencies, including low transaction fees, global accessibility, and increased security.

Website: [https://www.bitcanna.io](https://www.bitcanna.io)

### What is Cosmos Pay?
Cosmos Pay is an open-source plugin developed by BitCanna for the e-commerce. Currently it is live for the platforms WooCommerce and Prestashop. Keplr is integrated, making the user experience to pay as smooth as possible.
The plugin offers the possibility to integrate a lot (if not all) Cosmos-SDK based cryptocurrencies and is therefore an addition to the tools the Cosmos ecosystem already has to offer. In the current setup ATOM, OSMO, JUNO and BCNA are supported; with more to come in the (near) future. Find out more [here](https://commerce.bitcanna.io).

### Why this proposal?
Support from the community is one of the greatest perks in the Cosmos-ecosystem. Via this route we want to give the Juno community a chance to have their say in this and to have a method to express their support of the Juno community to have JUNO enabled as a coin in the Cosmos Pay plugin. Similar proposals will be uploaded to the Osmosis and Cosmos communities to get their support as well.

"Launch Sauce SubDAO

### Deliverables

- Produce 5 creative and original thought-provoking memes or gifs per week that capture the attention of the Cosmos and inspire. All memes will have a ''Juno Sauce'' watermark.
- Organize 3 Twitter Spaces per week, with a length of 60 minutes+ each. Titles will always include SAUCE or MEME , and discussion will gravitate to Juno News (but may go off topic sometimes).
- Any ''FUD'' or drama directed at Juno will instantly be dealt with by the meme army AND we will not hesitate to resort to ''Twitter bots'' to sway engagement in our favour.
- Will be organizing a monthly Poker Tournament for the Juno community. Any donations for prizes are welcome for this initiative.
- Hold a monthly JUNO meme competition
- Hold a JUNO meme class and an educational workshop on how to create memes.
- Partial coverage of Juno spaces and other Juno news by Rekt News.

If the communication subDAO is polite and neutral, the Juno Sauce subDAO aims to be loud and capture the attention of Crypto Twitter.

### Value added

- Bringing a sense of belonging to the Juno community,
- Bringing a sense of fun and playfulness. More excitement and fireworks to Juno.
- Keeping the Juno and Cosmos community informed of new developments happening on Juno Network.
- Onboarding new users that enjoy culture and love to see an engaged community.
- Devs can focus on doing dev work instead of spending time shitposting on twitter.

### Funding

Juno Sauce SubDAO will be initially funded with around 0 JUNO. We only ask to be paid in good vibes.

Good vibes will be spent on the following:

- Pay imaginary salaries for professional artists and meme makers.
- Pay imaginary salaries for professional talkers that spend more than half their day on Twitter Spaces.
- Pay eventual bots for Twitter engagement if needed.
- Allocate to community-incentivized events such as Poker and Meme contests

A monthly report of engagement metrics will be provided. The scope of this proposal is for 1 month.

### Background

Memes are one of the best ways to grow a community especially in the crypto space. Some of the biggest accounts on crypto Twitter with the largest following and engagement are simply meme accounts.

Meme accounts are some of the purest forms of comedy. Memes are a form of online communication that can be a fun and effective way to share ideas and culture. They often use humor and creativity to make complex ideas more accessible, and can help bring people together around a common interest or topic. Additionally, memes can be a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing people to express their opinions and engage in political and cultural discussions in a way that is relatable and engaging. Overall, memes can be a positive force in culture by promoting communication and collaboration, as well as providing a platform for artistic expression and social commentary.

HackJuno Türkiye

Summary:

HackJuno Turkey has emerged as the dream of a group of people and communities that have proven themselves in the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem. Educational institutions -Universities- and other Blockchain-Web3 communities in the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem, especially 0xWilds (Blockchain Ecosystem), Castrum Istanbul (Next Generation Blockchain Ecosystem), Tabellio (Developer Team in Cosmos Ecosystem), Nova Ratio Labs (Cosmos Developer Team) HackJuno Turkey, which we plan to realize under the leadership of, stands out with its ""GameFi,"" ""Game to Awareness"" and ""Social Responsibility"" points, unlike other Blockchain, Based Hackhatkons. We have three main topics that we will consider as Hackathon content; DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi.

Goal:

As the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem, our primary purpose in wanting to realize the ""HackJuno Turkey Hackathon"" event is to introduce the Cosmos network, especially the Juno Ecosystem, to the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem and market because many projects that we can develop with the Cosmos and Juno ecosystem will bring us to the forefront in the international and national sense, especially the Blockchain and Web3 communities in Turkey.

Social Responsibility:

Our aim on this path, which we set out with the motto of awareness, is to create and shape the motivation of potential web3 developers while organizing a hackathon. The ""Turkey Inter-University E-sports Tournament,"" which is among the events we will collect in parallel with the ""HackJuno Turkey"" hackathon, also carries a social responsibility purpose with the training we will give to the tournament participants at the workshops. Bringing potential talent and creators from Blockchain, Web3, and GameFi into the ecosystem is one of our main objectives at this event.

Why are we different from other Hackathons?

The main thing that will make HackJuno Turkey different from other Hackathons is education and awareness. As we mentioned in our primary purpose, we aim to create value for the ecosystem without making any profit in this event; Thanks to this value, we aim to make a material and moral contribution to the Turkish Blockchain Ecosystem.

"Protocol Owned Liquidity proposal on WYND DEX

This proposal is to request 166,000 $JUNO ($250,000) from the community pool to be added with 835,000 $WYND ($250,000) minted by the WYND DAO into the JUNO/WYND pool on WYND DEX as Protocol Owned Liquidity.

You can read more about what is POL and WYND DEX here 

https://dex.wynddao.com/
https://medium.com/wynddao/wynnovation-protocol-owned-liquidity-78fbbadac86f 

## Parameters of this agreement if passed

1. ~$500,000 of liquidity will be added to the WYND/JUNO pool on WYND DEX. 
1. The Juno Community pool and the WYND DAO will each own 50% of provided liquidity. This is not a spend, but rather a reallocation of unutilized $JUNO into a defi protocol.
1. The liquidity may be removed at a future date, and the value of the liquidity at the time of removal will be returned to the Juno Community pool and the WYND DAO at 50/50 distribution. Specifically, at the time of removal from the liquidity pool, all available $JUNO will be sent to the Juno Community Pool and all available $WYND will be sent to the WYND DAO.
1. None of the liquidity will be bondend so it will not impact incentives for regular liquidity providers. If community want to bond these tokens they should open a new governance proposal specific for this.
1. In case the community decides to bond tokens in the future, the incentives earned will be split 50% to Juno Community pool and 50% to WYND DAO.
1. $WYND incentives earned by Juno Community pool will be sent to the Juno Community pool. The Juno Community pool has the full right to determine how these assets are used, including but not limited to selling/swapping, staking for governance rights, providing liquidity, or to use in other defi applications. 
1. Participation in Protocol Owned Liquidity can be withdrawn at any time for any reason by either party.
1. Modification of existing parameters, such as adding, partially removing liquidity, or adding / modifying the bondend amount or duration will also require an on-chain governance vote by both parties.


## Plan of action

Community pool tokens from Juno and WYND DAO will be  sent to a Juno/WYND PoL multi-sig address that will then allocate token to the liquidity pools. This subDAO will also maintain custody of the LP position unless a governance proposal from either Juno or WYND dictates otherwise.

Any excess $WYND goes to the WYND DAO community pool. This means in effect that each side contributes a maximum number of tokens as given in the proposal, but the swap is performed at market price at time of LPing, so the token with better price action will receive some of the tokens back

## Note

_Protocol Owned Liquidity_ is a novel concept that has yet to be successfully implemented in the Cosmos Ecosystem. If this proposal passes, Juno will be the home of the first ever protocol owned liquidity governed by a DAO. The successful implementation of Protocol Owned Liquidity with the Juno Community pool will pave the way to attract more interchain liquidity to Juno Network and WYND DEX.

"Convert Core 1 to an Official SubDAO

From the original [Juno Tokenomics blog post](https://medium.com/@JunoNetwork/jun%C3%B8-tokenomics-and-utility-powering-the-worlds-first-fully-interoperable-smart-contract-ce9f490c4d97):

> Approx 10% of the supply difference was allocated to the core-1 development reserve (multi-sig) address for the funding of core infrastructure development.

Core 1 (also know as Root) has helped make Juno into what it is today, a vibrant community and one of the leading chains in the Cosmos. At the same time, Core 1 has not been perfect. As Juno has grown it has increasingly become important to bring in more community representation and decentralization of responsibilities. Thus, Core 1 must evolve.

This proposal aims to make Core 1 an official Juno SubDAO, making it's membership an elected position with the potential to remove members that are no longer active, as well as giving the community direct admin ability. The SubDAO shall be funded by transfering the current Core 1 Develoment Reserve tokens to the new Core 1 SubDAO.

## The Future Core-1 SubDAO

Core 1 will continue to carry out its assigned mission of funding and leading development of Juno.

For ease of transition, existing Core 1 members will also be part of the new SubDAO:

- [Wolf](https://twitter.com/lobojuno)
- [Dimi](https://twitter.com/dimiandre)
- [Jake](https://twitter.com/JakeHartnell)
- [Block](https://twitter.com/CosmosChain)
- [Jack](https://twitter.com/jackzampolin)

In addition, two additional individuals Juno's Core contributors will be added:

- [Maxjuno](https://twitter.com/max_maxsolo)
- [the-frey](https://twitter.com/frey_needlecast)

Juno would not exist without them, and both have spent many sleepless nights in service of this chain.

Future members may be elected by governance, at any point members may be removed by governance if the community looses confidence in them.

## Implementation

This proposal will create an official Core-1 SubDAO with the individuals listed above as official members.

Upon the passing of this proposal, the existing Core 1 multisig will transfer any liquid funds to the new official SubDAO. The vesting funds remaining in the existing Core 1 Development Fund multisig will be transfered to the Official Core 1 SubDAO in a future software upgrade.

## Verifying the SubDAO Instantiation Message

"Juno v12 Upgrade (Stop Governance Spam)

# Juno v12 Upgrade Proposal

To reduce spamming in the Juno governance system, we propose requiring a 20% deposit (200 JUNO) on proposal creation. This will ensure that only quality proposals are submitted and deter malicious governance spam. Should you wish to make a proposal, but don\'t have 200 Juno, you can reach out to a member of the core team or Sub-DAOs for assistance. The minimum deposit is meant to deter spam, not participation.

Tag v12.0.0-beta.1 has been tested on our testnet, uni-6, and will be finalized as v12.0.0 if this proposal passes.

**NOTE** This subsequently renames the previous [v12 upgrade to v13 from our medium blog post](https://medium.com/@reecepbcups/juno-v12-update-4bab64640a62)

Provided this upgrade passes, it is scheduled for block [7075551](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/blocks/7075551). Roughly expected Monday, February 20th around 1700UTC.

## Voting Options

YES: Agree to proceed with the Juno v12 upgrade and stop governance spam with the deposit requirement.
NO: Disagree with the v12 upgrade and the deposit requirement.
NO WITH VETO: Disagree with the upgrade and want depositors penalized.

"Juno v13 Upgrade

# Juno v13 Upgrade

This network upgrade brings the following changes to Juno Network:

- x/FeeShare Module
- x/TokenFactory Module
- CosmWasm v0.30
- IBC v4
- Packet Forward Middleware

Due to deterministic issues with the oracle module on our testnet, it has been pushed to v14 or later.

---

## x/FeeShare Module

This module's addition was passed in [Juno Proposal 51](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/51)

If you're a smart contract developer on Juno, you can now earn a cut of all gas fees generated on your contract. Initially this is set to 50% of all gas fees which interact with your contract directly. 
Governance at any time can change this percentage to any value between 0% and 100%, add new tokens to be paid in (ex; USDC, OSMO, etc), or toggle this feature entirely.
This module helps incentivize developers to build on Juno Network and bring new business models that are not directly DeFi related.

## x/TokenFactory Module

This module allows anyone to create a native token on Juno Network. This drastically increases the UX and UI of the networks utility tokens. As a developer, it also removes the need to support both native assets and CW20 in your contracts.
DAOs/SubDAOs can control a contract which mints tokens for other business logic in your contracts through our [TokenFactory Middleware Contracts](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/tokenfactory-contracts).

## CosmWasm v0.30

You can read all of the great features in x/wasmd v0.30.0 in [Confio's medium article here](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/wasmd-0-30-released-8e9932929238).

## Packet Forward Middleware

This new middleware allows for the forwarding of IBC packets through Juno's infrastructure to final destination chains. As cosmos zones expand, the need for multi-hop transactions will increase for scaling. 
This new module allows for Juno to be a ""relay"" chain for other zones. Where a newly launched chain can just focus on relaying to and from Juno, and in return can route these packets to all the zones Juno is connected too. 
With this, public relayers will be able to earn fees in the future with these transactions along with the [ICS29 IBCFees module added in this update](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/main/docs/middleware/ics29-fee).

## Other Changes

- Complete overhaul of the main app for easier upgradeability
- ICA Host and Controller

"Increase maximum per block gas to 100 million

# Increase Per Block Gas

[Commonwealth Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/10396-increase-maximum-per-block-gas-to-100-million)

Previously in [Juno proposal 6](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/6), the team lowered per block gas to 10 million *(from 100 million)* to stop potential attacks against the network. Since then, we have tested on our testnet (Uni-6) and have confirmed these attacks are no longer possible after the v13 upgrade. With this, the chain is now safe to increase back to 100 million gas per block.

This has been a major pain point for many projects including NFTs (minting), DeFi, CW20 migrations, and oracle data submissions. With this change, it allows more complex logic to be built on Juno and provide a better user experience, as well as increasing the number of possible transactions per block.

**NOTE** The transaction size limit will remain at 22,020,096 bytes per block (22Mb). We have not had any need or requests to alter this.

"Use Skip Tendermint By Default

# Skip Tendermint By Default in Juno

[Commonwealth Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/10223-use-skip-by-default)

Juno has the highest adoption of [Skip](https://skip.money/) in Cosmos. To simplify validator operations, this proposal, if passed, signals for the Juno binary use Skip by default. This approach has been tested by Notional while comparing Tendermint and comet, and there is no operational difference.

Using Skip by default does not require validators to use Skip (opt-in), it purely just uses their implementation by default for validators who do use Skip. Each validator will still have the option to use skip or not, as they choose.

---

## Will other MEV providers be considered?

Right now, Skip MEV is the leading MEV provider in Cosmos. If another provider comes up and validators decide to switch to it, governance can always be used to change to the new MEV provider by default. This is more of a QOL addition for validators, which just ensures those who use it have it pre-installed during upgrades. Validators can continue to use other MEV solutions if they choose.

## How will this MEV build be integrated into the Juno codebase?

It will be replaced in the go.mod from standard Tendermint to Skip's version. You can find [a PR of this here](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/587).

"WYND DEX External Incentives for JUNO/USDC Pool

## Summary
In February, the WYND team initiated a discussion on the Juno Commonwealth seeking external incentives. We listened to the feedback of the Juno community and decided to submit proposals for individual pools as we continue to prove ourselves the Juno community. You can find the [full discussion on CommonWealth](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/10178-wynd-dex-external-incentives-for-juno-pairs)

The WYND team is requesting 120,000 $JUNO to be distributed as incentives in the JUNO/USDC pool over the next three months. This represents 10% of the remaining tokens held by the multisignature wallet managing the old Junoswap incentives. Increasing liquidity in this pool will have a stabilizing benefit to the $JUNO token and ecosystem at large.

 With the launch of WYND DEX and LSD within 2 months, WYND has proven itself to be a valuable contributor to Juno's growth and a committed builder. Additional proposals seeking support from Juno will follow as we continue to deliver. We are requesting incentives for a three month period rather than a year, thus enabling the Juno community to continually evaluate our contributions.

## Voting
YES - You agree to provide 120,000 $JUNO from the multisignature wallet as external incentives for the JUNO/USDC pool on WYND DEX over the following three months

"Protocol Owned Liquidity: wyJUNO/JUNO Staking Swap Pool

**Proposal**
LSD has launched on WYND. The Staking Swap pools and leveraging of WYND DEX will allow for pools with deep liquidity and very low slippage. To learn more on the mathematics behind WYND LSD, see this [Medium article](https://medium.com/wynddao/deep-diving-into-lsd-and-the-trip-it-will-take-us-on-66276aefe5a7).

This proposal is requesting 1,000,000 $JUNO from the Juno Community pool to the wyJUNO/JUNO pool as [Protocol Owned Liquidity](https://medium.com/wynddao/can-protocol-owned-wynd-replace-external-incentives-477e45cb1086) (POL). 500,000 $JUNO will be converted to wyJUNO and it will be deposited to the pool. The tokens will not be bonded (though this can be changed via Juno governance).


**Benefits**
1. This bootstraps the adoption of LSD assets on Juno as a whole which will drive tremendous value and TVL to Juno from other projects and ecosystems.
2. The Juno community pool currently holds 16,067,447 $JUNO. This is losing 20% of its value this year due to the inflation rate. Half will be staked as wyJUNO which enables the community pool to earn revenue
3. There will be no negative price impact to JUNO because it is a wyJUNO/JUNO pair which creates no sell pressure
4. The Juno community will retain full control over these assets; POL, not externals
5. There will be extremely limited IL due to the setup of the Staking Swap pool, see this article for more information
**Cons**
1. Because half will be staked, this will reduce the current overall APR from ~33.53% to ~33.23%, which represents a ~0.3% reduction. The establishment of deep liquidity in the wyJUNO/JUNO pool paves the way for vast DeFi opportunities on Juno and is expected to drive more LSD and DeFi adoption through current and future project synergies. The WYND team strongly feels that the minor APR reduction will be offset by increased on-chain activity and TVL growth resulting from this POL.


**Multisignature**
The same multisignature address used in the [first POL](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/141) will be used for this proposal.

"Juno Upgrade: Aurora v14

# Juno Aurora Upgrade (v14)

[Juno Medium v14 Article](https://medium.com/@JunoNetwork/jun%C3%B8-aurora-ac67a8143e22)

This upgrade brings the following major changes to Juno Network:
- x/GlobalFee Module
- x/IBC-Hooks Module
- 0 Fee IBC Relaying
- Stargate Staking Queries
- Tokenfactory: ForceTransfer, MintTo, and BurnFrom (admin only)
- x/wasmd 0.31
- wasmvm 1.2.1
- Skip's mev CometBFT by default

## x/GlobalFee Module

[Signaling proposal from December 13th, 2022: PASSED](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/68)

Currently on cosmos based chains, the validators are fully in control of the network fees. With this new module, a minimum gas fee is set by governance to set the gas floor.

At the upgrade, gas fees are set to our [setup documentation gas prices default](https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/joining-mainnet#set-minimum-gas-prices):
- 0.0025ujuno
- 0.001uatom (ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9)

At any time, governance can increase these fees across the network to help deliver more for developers (through feeshare) and stakers. It can also add new tokens to be accepted as fees, such as OSMO and/or USDC in the future.
If an transaction attack occurs on Juno, validators are still able to raise their fees ABOVE the minimum gas fee to protect the network as needed.

The only exception to this are bypassed messages for IBC relaying and transfers. These messages are exempt from the minimum gas fee within reasonable limits. For this to work, validators **must** set their fees to be: '0ujuno,0ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9' in their app.toml. No other denoms can be accepted UNLESS governance passes a proposal to do so.

## x/IBCHooks Module

This [module from the osmosis team](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/ibc-hooks) allows for token transfers (of the [ICS-20 spec](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer) ) to call contracts cross chain. The primary importantance of this is allowing cross chain swaps. 

## x/wasmd 0.31 & wasmv 1.2.1

[wasmvm 1.2.1 Confio Article](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/cosmwasm-1-2-5f10f4f653ea)

The main feature from this update which many development teams have requested is instantiate2 to replicate a contract with predictable addresses. You can find an example of this with the [contract example](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/v1.2.1/contracts/virus). Some other notable improvements include:
- Governance based weighted votes
- new queries from wasmvm 1.2 (add the cosmwasm_1_2 feature in your contract toml)
- Uint128/Decimal multiplication
- A new 'Never' type

## New Token Factory Methods

From the previous upgrade, v13, we added the x/TokenFactory module to deliver a better UX for developers and users alike. As the admin of a token denomination you can now Force transfer tokens between accounts, Mint directly to an account, and burn from another account. In the future we will also add support for disabling the sending of tokens, and only allowing minting/burning for specific application needs.

## Stargate Staking Queries

Contracts can now query the chain for an accounts: Delegation, Redelegations, and Unbonding information.

## Skip MEV by default

With the passing of [Juno proposal 275](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/275), Skip's MEV CometBFT consensus is now used by default.

## Command Line improvements

You can now specify the following configurations for any transaction commands you run:
- Gas
- Gas Prices
- Gas Adjustment
- Fees
- Fee-Account
- Note (memo)

Set these with **junod config fees 5000ujuno** or **junod config gas-prices 0.0025ujuno**.

"Juno <> DAO DAO Token Swap

# Juno ❤️ $DAO

DAO DAO is a DAO that builds next-generation Interchain governance tooling. With DAO DAO, projects have immediate access to best-in-class DAO tooling without creating their own governance modules, smart contracts, DAO management and more.

You can use it on Juno today! [https://daodao.zone](https://daodao.zone)

We propose a token swap between DAO DAO and Juno. DAO DAO is offering 1,100,002.7 $DAO (10% of total supply, over 50% of liquid supply) in exchange for 500,000 $JUNO (~3.28% of current Community Pool funds). The tokens shall vest linearly, with a fixed amount unlocking every block, over two years. These funds will support and accelerate the future development of DAO DAO. DAO DAO will stake these tokens with a diverse set of validators as determined by the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q), *excluding* the [DAO DAO validator](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/validators/junovaloper185hgkqs8q8ysnc8cvkgd8j2knnq2m0ah6ae73gntv9ampgwpmrxqlfzywn).

The $DAO tokens will allow the Juno community to vote on how funds should be used, as well as on the future direction of DAO DAO. After this token swap is completed, Juno will own the largest share of liquid $DAO tokens, giving it substantial influence over the future direction of DAO DAO.

$DAO tokens from the swap will go to the Juno Growth Fund SubDAO, to be managed by them until otherwise directed by the Juno community. The JGF will actively participate in DAO DAO governance to ensure that DAO DAO's actions are aligned with the interests of Juno stakers. As an Official SubDAO, the Juno community will be able to change this arrangement at any time and shall remain the ultimate deciders on how the tokens should be distributed.

With some of the best developers in the Cosmos ecosystem working on DAO DAO, this swap will help align incentives between DAO DAO and the Juno community and accelerate future development. We hope that many protocols and DAOs will continue to use our tools and create value for the community.

## What is $DAO?

The DAOs that rely on DAO DAO deserve a say in how DAO DAO works. $DAO gives you a voice in this DAO of DAOs. We give that voice to the contributors who build DAO DAO, and to the DAOs that use it.

$DAO won't pay dividends, and it doesn't entitle holders to the fruits of others' labor.

We envision DAO DAO as a DAO of DAOs. By giving $DAO to Juno, we invite Juno to become a member of DAO DAO. Through this swap, Juno will have a say in DAO DAO, and DAO DAO will have a say in Juno. This swap reflects the mutualistic relationship that already exists between Juno and DAO DAO; each supports the other.

## Token Swap and Vesting Mechanics

In coordination with the [Juno Growth Fund](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1xz54y0ktew0dcm00f9vjw0p7x29pa4j5p9rwq6zerkytugzg27qs4shxnt#proposals), we have created audited vesting contracts that any project on Juno can utilize.

This proposal will send 500,000 $JUNO to the JGF, who will then instantiate a new [cw-vesting](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/tree/main/contracts/external/cw-vesting) contract with the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q) as the recipient for the full amount to be vested linearly over a two-year period, with a start date matching the passing of this proposal. Upon the passing and successful execution of this proposal, the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q) will vote to vest 1,100,002.7 $DAO tokens linearly over a period of two years (also with a start date matching the passing of this proposal) to the Juno Growth Fund, who will manage the funds on behalf and under the direction of the community.

The Juno Growth Fund will be the admin and owner of the vesting contract and will also maintain temporary control over the $DAO tokens. As it is an Official Juno SubDAO, the Juno Community also has full control by proxy. Should for whatever reason DAO DAO fail to vest the 1,100,002.7 $DAO tokens, dissatisfy the community, or not live up to expectations, the Juno Community or Juno Growth Fund can vote to cancel payment of the remaining unvested $JUNO funds. In addition, the Juno Growth Fund will be able to stake vested $DAO tokens and vote to represent Juno's interests in the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q).

**Conditions for cancelation:**

- DAO DAO delegates vested funds to its own validator
- DAO DAO stops developing new features
- DAO DAO radically changes its tokenomics in a way that the Juno Community is unhappy with
- The Juno community becomes displeased with DAO DAO for *whatever reason*

*In the event of a dispute, Juno Community governance shall be the ultimate arbitrator.*

Should DAO DAO launch a chain in the coming years (which it has no plans to do at the present moment), DAO DAO commits to an airdrop for $JUNO stakers during the incubation period for incubating DAO DAO.

## Future $DAO Distributions

This will not be the only distribution to the Juno community. As noted in our [$DAO Tokenomics blog post](https://medium.com/@dao-dao/dao-757c872df4ac):

> ""In the future, we expect to perform token swaps with many DAOs. We imagine that those DAOs will frequently vote to distribute some or all of those $DAO tokens to their members. In that world, we expect the “airdrop” of $DAO tokens will be an ongoing, organic process.""

In other words, to incentivize the creation of interesting DAOs on Juno, we will be swapping tokens with the best DAOs emerging on Juno (as determined by the [DAO DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q)). Go forth and create!

"1/6 Communications SubDAO conferences budget

# 1/6 Communications SubDAO conferences budget

## What is the Juno Communications SubDAO?
Juno Communications SubDAO was created in November 2022, since then the team has been working hard providing quality branding and communication across various Juno official and un-official channels.

Some of the work done so far include the following:

* New Juno brand identity 
* Weekly community calls ([Example](https://twitter.com/JunoNetwork/status/1645435038245486592))
* Interviews and Snippets ([Example](https://twitter.com/JunoCommsDao/status/1646053783846223874))
* Twitter coverage with Juno updates ([Link](https://twitter.com/JunoCommsDao))
* Youtube weekly videos ([Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@junocommunications))
* Medium articles ([Link](https://medium.com/@JunoNetwork))
* Telegram & Discord channels management 

The team has been working on a close-to-0 budget till now, using treasury for reimbursing expenses only. You can monitor all the spending proposals submitted on DAO DAO [here](https://daodao.zone/it/dao/juno15zw5zt2pepx8n8675dz3k3yscdu94d24yhqqz00uzyx7ydf2vfmswz6nzw#proposals).

## Budget request
With the following proposals, we are asking funding from the community pool to cover conference-related expenses. 

The conference season is about to begin, and we would like to participate in some as sponsors and in others as participants. We think that the presence of Juno in these conferences is important, asserting Juno as the leading CosmWasm blockchain in the Interchain Ecosystem and showing off all the good work being put by the Core Development team.

Here is a table of the upcoming conferences, we intend to support, and their corresponding budgeting:


| Conference Name | Date | Location | Sponsor Budget | Comms Budget |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| AwesomWasm | July 12,13 | Berlin | 5,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| OsmoCon     | July 21     | Paris      | 15,000 USD  | 1,000 USD   |
| Nebular Hacker House | July 22, 23 | Paris | 5,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| Nebular Summit | July 24, 25 | Paris | 9,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| HackWasm Italy | September 16th (tbc) | Italy | 8,000 USD | 0 USD |
| After-Cosmoverse Hackathon | October 5,6 | Istanbul | 15,000 USD | 2,000 USD |

*NOTE: Cosmoverse will take place in Istanbul on 2nd-4th of October. Discussion is still ongoing with the organizers and a separate proposal will be submitted when details are ready.*

## Community Spend
*Pure sponsorships costs:* 57,000 USD
*Comms costs:* 9,000 USD (500 USD * Person * Day)

Comms Costs include the following
- Travel & Accommodation
- Equipment

*Total funding requested:* **66,000 USD** 

The funds will go to the Juno Communications SubDAO treasury. For spending purposes, tokens will be sold OTC (Over-the-Counter) or through low-volume-transaction swapping over DEXs when needed.
Juno Governance can always recall the funds back to the community pool.
Any unspent remaining funds will stay in the SubDAO treasury for future usage.

*NOTE: Two conferences are already waiting for contract signing. Until the payment deadline is close, the SubDAO might consider liquid staking the tokens in the mean time.*

## Voting Procedure for Conferences/Events
We are submitting a total of 6 proposals for the 6 conferences above, community is free to vote on each proposal to signal whether we should support a conference or not. 

The budget for every conference is the best deal we were able to come across after negotations and discussions with the organizers; modifying the sponsor packages to best suit our needs and handpicking the necessities.

Juno Communications SubDAO is in favor of supporting the conferences listed above.

This is a signaling proposal to check the community's interest in introducing the proposals for the mentioned conferences. In case if this proposal gets rejected, it would indicate that the community do not want the Communications SubDAO to work on conferences and events at all.

"Deploy 1M JUNO to the stJUNO/JUNO pool on Osmosis

Summary
-------

The ultimate objective of this initiative is to create the conditions for Stride's stJUNO to be approved as collateral on the Umee money market.

Umee contributors have determined that 1M JUNO in the stJUNO/JUNO Osmosis stableswap pool is the minimum trading liquidity needed to safely enable stJUNO collateralization on Umee.

Therefore, this proposal asks the Juno community to deploy 1M JUNO of protocol owned liquidity (POL) to the stJUNO pool on Osmosis.

This 1M JUNO would not be spent in any way, and would always remain under the control of the Juno community.

The term of this liquidity position would be one year. If Juno governance does not authorize an extension by passing a new signaling proposal, the 1M JUNO will be withdrawn and returned to the community pool on May 1st, 2024.

Justification
-------------

Recently, JUNO was approved as collateral on Umee. This was a hugely significant development for JUNO. For the first time, it gave JUNO holders an alternative to selling. Now, JUNO holders can access the equity of their JUNO without selling, simply by using Umee to borrow USDC against JUNO.

However, unstaked JUNO forfeits its staking rewards when collateralized. Given the high JUNO staking reward, this is a major disincentive to borrowing against JUNO. 

The solution to this problem is liquid staking. If Umee supported liquid staked JUNO, then users would be able to borrow against their JUNO without forfeiting staking rewards. This would likely increase the popularity of borrowing against JUNO and thereby decrease sell pressure.

But in order for stJUNO to be supported by Umee, Umee contributors have determined that at least 1M of JUNO liquidity is needed in the stJUNO/JUNO stableswap pool on Osmosis. This liquidity is needed so that the pool can serve as a reliable oracle for the price of stJUNO while at the same time absorb potential stJUNO liquidations.

Stride and Osmosis
------------------

Stride's liquid staked token of JUNO, stJUNO, launched in October of 2023. To give the Juno community a voice in the Stride DAO, 200,000 STRD was airdropped to JUNO stakers. Since the launch of stJUNO, its supply has steadily increased, suggesting that JUNO holders believe stJUNO to be useful and trust-worthy. 

Stride prioritizes security over all else. The Stride codebase has been independently audited by three security firms, and receives continuous auditing from Informal Systems. The Stride blockchain is on track to adopt interchain security, which would increase its economic security by more than 100x. And to mitigate any potential issue, the Stride chain uses IBC rate-limiting.

Turning to Osmosis, it is the most suitable place for this 1M of JUNO liquidity for two main reasons. First, Umee's oracle implementation is currently configured for Osmosis. This means that Osmosis liquidity pools can serve as oracles for tokens listed on Umee, but liquidity pools on other DEXes currently cannot. Second, Osmosis has a stableswap pool type, making it an ideal place for an LST pool. As opposed to constant product, the stableswap pool type utilizes liquidity much more efficiently.

Details
-------

If this proposal passes, it will release 1M JUNO from the community pool to a subDAO / multisig controlled by these trusted community members:

- Rarma (C-2)
- Brandon (Umee)
- John (Stride)
- Dimi (C-1)
- Reece (C-2)

You can check the multisig on DaoDao: https://daodao.zone/it/dao/juno15y8mzyzyksw2wzfcv5d67j5pzxzwj0n00agt5kk08mqwykqamheqgvsd9l/proposals

The multisig signers have bound themselves to follow this set of instructions. Multisig signers will:

1. Liquid stake 500K JUNO with Stride protocol, resulting in a certain amount of stJUNO.
2. Provide the remaining 500K JUNO along with the full stJUNO amount to the JUNO/stJUNO (# 817) liquidity pool on Osmosis.
3. Leave the liquidity in the pool, and do nothing else with it.
4. If Juno governance does not make a signaling proposal to extend the term of this liquidity position, withdraw the 1M JUNO from the liquidity pool and return it to the Juno community pool on May 1st, 2024.
5. If Juno governance passes any signaling proposal at any time containing instructions for the multisig regarding the 1M JUNO liquidity position, then promptly follow those instructions.

Final thoughts
--------------

There's currently ~15M JUNO in the community pool. Deploying 1M of that liquidity to the stJUNO/JUNO pool to enable stJUNO collateralization on Umee would be a very good deal for the Juno community. None of the 1M JUNO would be spent in any way, and would always remain under the control of the Juno community. With stJUNO listed on Umee, JUNO holders would have a good alternative to selling - they would be able to borrow against their JUNO without forfeiting any staking rewards.

If this vote passes and the 1M is provided to the stJUNO Osmosis pool, an Umee governance proposal to enable stJUNO collateralization on Umee will quickly be made. And Umee contributors are confident that such a proposal would pass.",0.010666518311863752
"Juno Upgrade: v15

# Juno TokenFactory Upgrade (v15)

This upgrade brings the following major changes to Juno Network:
- New TokenFactory DenomCreationGasConsume parameter (2 million gas consumption to create a new token)
- Cleanup for the next release (SDK v47)

This change is required for DeFi contract developers for a simpler UX when using the tokenfactory in their contracts.

"Increase Network Fees

# Increase Minimum Gas Prices

[Commonwealth thread](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/11088-param-change-increase-gas-prices)

With the previous v14 Juno upgrade, Fees are now controlled through governance.

This proposes we multiply the current gas rates by x3 for ATOM and 30x for JUNO due to current market prices.

*(A slight premium is added to ATOM since JUNO is the native currency of this network.)*

- Current Gas: 0.0025ujuno,0.001uatom
- New Gas:	 0.0750ujuno,0.003uatom

---

## Reasons

- Juno's cost per transaction is extremely cheap relative to network activity. The average cost of a transaction with default gas (683,665) is just $0.00146 USD.
- This increases developers' fee-share revenue 30x. However, contract usage premium will still make up a larger portion of income.

## Notes

- IBC packet relaying cost will remain at 0 costs for relayers & IBC transfers.
- This will break scripts & MEV bots which have the old gas prices set.
- Keplr, Leap, and Cosmostation will require an update to their configs for Juno's gas prices.
- uatom is channel-1 ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9

"Increase governance deposit to 5000JUNO

## Increase Juno's Deposit Minimum

[Commonwealth Thread](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/11579-increase-governance-deposit-to-5000juno)

With the decline in JUNO's price the past few months, we have seen an uptick in scam proposals making it to voting period. With this, this proposal will update Juno's current governance deposit from 1000JUNO to 5000JUNO if passed.
Currently this includes: 296, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303. All of these are used to phish for users wallet mnemonics and drain their personal funds. 

By increasing this, it increases the cost of the attack which makes it unprofitable to execute on.
The minimum deposit rate to enter deposit period will remain at the same at 20%, which would now be 1000 JUNO.

 www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8 

 It has 2.5 million Juno instead of 50k (Which was the max per account)  

 One of the main reasons for this proposal is that this address has staked the majority to one validator. This action is centralizing the network. They also did not delegate until Juno started trading on Osmosis. This would indicate that it was done so that it would be impossible to just restart the chain with this amount changed to 50k. 

  They just started to redelegate 250k Juno to SG1, which is the second biggest validator I can only assume because of the backlash. SG1 is the 2nd biggest validator so they don’t seem to understand the concept of decentralization. By not fixing this issue now it will lead to long term centralized governance issues. 

 I propose that we blacklist/delete 90% of the Juno in this account. This action is not done lightly. By the time this proposal goes through, they will not have been able to undelegate in time to prevent the decision of governance. 

 By voting yes to this proposal you agree that the Juno tokens in this account be reduced by 90% and that  future blacklisting/reducing of coins should not be taken lightly.",0.4422228643097908
"Community Spend Proposal for Liquidity Funding on JUNO/XKI Incentivized Pool

This proposal is intended to further bootstrap Juno liquidity on the Osmosis AMM.

By voting YES on this proposal, 250,000 JUNO from the community pool will be allocated to the JUNO/XKI pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

Allocate 250,000 JUNO to LPs on the JUNO/XKI pool
Distribution: 1388 JUNO/Per day for 180 days

The Ki Foundation will be matching this proposal with 6,250,000 XKI to LPs on the JUNO/XKI pool.
Distribution: 34722 XKI/Per day for 180 days.

Effectively the JUNO/XKI pool would have at least triple incentives:
1. Juno bonus incentives,
2. XKI bonus incentives,
3. Swap fees.

Should proposal #76 pass ( https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/76 ), the JUNO/XKI pool would have a unique quadruple incentives:
1. OSMO bonus incentives,
2. Juno bonus incentives,
3. XKI bonus incentives,
4. Swap fees.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s )

** IMPORTANT **

The requested funds will be sent to a ledger wallet set up and managed by Dimi (juno1x3zhtluc2vlt9n0szynhur06s07f6y609h429r) that will provide technical assistance in the creation of the gauges for incentives, funds will be allocated to the JUNO/XKI pair ONLY when the exact $ amount in bonus incentives is matched by the Ki Foundation.

Should for whatever reason the matching not be possible, requested funds would be deposited back into the Juno community pool.

** About Ki & Klub **

Ki is offering the compliant gateway from the Fiat world to DeFi, through Klub Ki is building DeFi protocols that will live on top of Juno while being operated through interchain accounts of multiple chains.

"JunoSwap Signaling Proposal: Allow permissionless listing of bridged assets from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge

This is a basic signaling proposal to all JUNO stakers for them to signal their support for or dissent against allowing the permissionless listing of Sifchain’s bridged peggy assets on JunoSwap. 

This proposal is being put on chain for all JUNO stakers to vote on after an 8 day long discussion period in the commonwealth and in lieu of official governance mechanisms on JunoSwap DAO, which are expected to launch alongside the RAW airdrop.   

Summary:
By voting “yes” on this proposal, Juno stakers signal their support for allowing tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge to be listed on JunoSwap. 

By voting “no” on this proposal, Juno stakers signal their dissent against allowing tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge to be listed on JunoSwap.

Context:
Sifchain’s recent Magnolia upgrade has made ERC20 tokens from Sifchain’s peggy bridge IBC compatible. This makes it possible to transfer ETH or any ERC20 token from Peggy to JunoSwap, enabling such pairs as JUNO:ETH and JUNO:RNDR. 

In the very near future, Sifchain will soon upgrade peggy to Omni-EVM, which will enable quick deployment of EVM bridges, and enable token pairs on JunoSwap such as JUNO:NEAR and JUNO:SOL.

Benefits:
Enabling assets from different, secure bridges, ensures that users of JunoSwap will not be limited by the token-selection of only one bridge. This is relevant because many innovative bridge solutions will launch in Cosmos, and being limited to only one bridge will reduce the amount of assets that can be swapped on JunoSwap – thus sending users elsewhere to make swaps.  

While it has been argued by other DEXes that this makes UX unpleasant, there are many work arounds to this. For example, truly permissionless listings for all assets have not stopped UniSwap from achieving over $10B in TVL. Improvements to UX are as simple as implementing a manage-tokens toggle (appended below).    

If this Proposal Passes:
The community supports the permissionless listing of assets that come from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge. 

Additional Information  :
In order to ensure that conflicts-of-interest do not play a role in the outcomes of this proposal, we would encourage any validators that have a vested interest in the success of another bridge and choose to vote to:  

a) state their biases
 b) abstain

"Harmony Proposal to end FUD

This is a signaling proposal offering a compromise to the problems presented in [Prop 4](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/4) and [Prop 16](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/16).

CCN clients have agreed in advance by majority to support this compromise.

By voting YES, the Juno stakers voice their support

- To split All JUNO including staking rewards in [the address](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8) equally between the ""Community"" (50%) and ""CCN Clients"" (50%)

The funds will be allocated as follows:
- The ""Community Portion"" of JUNO allocated to a smart contract governed by the community.  Distribution will be determined through subsequent governance proposals
- The ""CCN Client Portion"" of JUNO to be distributed by CCN to CCN client addresses at a rate of 5% per month over 20 months.

This compromise ensures:
- The sanctity of funds in Juno Blockchain wallets is not violated as allocation is agreed by all parties (including original fund holders)
- Signals to future large JUNO holders that their funds will be honored and safe
- Ensures that the Juno community will gain governance power equal to that distributed to CCN clients

"Confirmation by CCN to agree to Unity Prop

This proposal signals that a neutral Third Party Auditor, who confirms the identities of CCN clients via standard KYC systems, confirms the proper amount of JUNO for distribution to each address, and confirms the proper wallet addresses for distribution would be sufficient basis to approve fund withdrawals from the Smart Contract as specified in [the Unity Prop](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/4102-prop-17-unity-win-win-win).

CCN is currently reviewing possible Auditors which can validate that distributions of JUNO only go to valid CCN clients, who are real people, who are in full control of their wallets, of the proper amount based on their investment.

This neutral and independent Audit will help the community confirm that CCN clients are real individuals and ensures that funds only go to real people (and not fake wallets owned by CCN).

CCN Seeks early community sentiment on whether this effort will be acceptable prior to contracting an external Auditing Team.

A vote for Yes means that you agree to proceed with distribution to the CCN clients’ addresses if they are substantiated through a neutral third-party audit.

A vote for No means that you disagree to proceed with distribution to the CCN clients’ addresses even if it is substantiated through a neutral third-party audit.

The third-party (institution) will clarify as follows:
- Confirm which CCN clients had paid for CCN service by February 18, 2021
- Clarify the number of JUNO that each client can receive
- Ensure the client passes KYC
- Ensure the client has control of the receiving wallet address

The process after the lock will be as follows:
- Create a smart contract based on CosmWasm merkle-drop, modified to handle native tokens
- Import all the addresses that passed KYC in the smart contract
- Send funds from unity contract to new one
- Allocate tokens proportionally, let CCN clients withdraw independently from CCN

"Make JUNO Carbon Neutral by Purchasing Eco-Credits


Proposal:
Make JUNO carbon neutral by purchasing NCT eco-credits from Osmosis DEX
- Based on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, and applying Method #3 ‘worst case scenario’, JUNO Validators are projected to emit at most 3928 tons a year in carbon, scaled up to cover from the start of JUNO (March 2021 to December 2022 - 22 Months) this becomes 7,201 tons
- Based on analysis from working with the JUNO core team (analysis here), the core team's carbon footprint is estimated to be: 6762 metric tons of carbon emitted from March 2021 to December 2022
- This gives a total carbon footprint of 13,963 tones for the JUNO Network.

This proposal asks for a spend of JUNO 60,929 (7,022 at JUNO price of .10) from the Community Pool to purchase 13,963 eco-credits and cover JUNO’s carbon emissions from March 2021 to December 2022
- Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval to address JUNO’s carbon emissions footprint by purchasing 13,963 Osmosis NCTs (USD 5,852 at  NCT). A 20% buffer will also be added to account for price changes (1,170) any unused funds will be returned.
- Voting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated.

Method:
The required JUNO will be transferred to multi signature custodial account managed by:
- Jake Hartnell (JUNO Network)
- Daniel Pittman (Regen Network)
- Pete Hill (JUNO Validator)

"Cosmos Option Vaults by CzarDAO

### Introduction - Cosmos Option Vaults Proposal

The full PDF of this proposal (complete with helpful graphics) is available [on IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeic3iflxv2ul4xm5gblu6upoxt3kwytpcm7aypgx5iocshim7etlui)

[Commonwealth Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/8839-option-vaults-by-czardao-draft-proposal)

CzarDAO is building a suite of DeFi dApps on the Juno blockchain. The DAO’s first product, [Førecast](https://forecast.deliverdao.org), launched successfully in November 2022 and has facilitated over 40k JUNO in volume in over 4,500 rounds on the platform. Førecast is a predictions market which sells binary options (“up” or “down” bets) on the underlying asset.

Now CzarDAO seeks to expand its options offerings by building an options vault on Cosmos based on [Ribbon finance’s](https://docs.ribbon.finance/) option vaults. Ribbon finance has long dominated the DeFi option space since its launch, in large part because it operates in a ‘set it and forget it’ fashion where users can earn real yield on their assets without having to constantly monitor their positions. With a quickly growing and vibrant set of assets native to Cosmos via IBC, there is a real need for this type of DeFi primitive.

With our experience, we are excited to propose, build, ship and open source a DeFi Option Vaults dApp to the Juno Network!

### Product Details

This proposal contains 6 milestones, beginning with the submission and acceptance of this proposal. Upon completion of the 6 milestones contained in this proposal CzarDAO will furnish a complete product offering access to yield-bearing vaults that sell covered calls with weekly expiries on the vault’s assets. CzarDAO will provide and maintain the UI, infrastructure and indexers to power a simple and wonderful user experience for this project.

In accordance with [Prop 64](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/64) all smart-contracts will released as open-source and furnished to the Juno community through the [CzarDAO GitHub](https://github.com/czar-dao).

### Grant Details and Timeline

Funds will be distributed after completion of each milestone via Juno Growth Fund.

We expect that this project will take us 4~5 months from the passage of this proposal to mainnet with a request of 75k USD equivalent in JUNO. Additionally, we will give the Juno Growth Fund wallet 20,000 CZAR to be staked (10% of current staked, so the SubDAO wallet will get 10% of all CzarDAO-wide revenue). That way as the wallet receives real yield, we can contribute to funding future development on Juno.

"Protocol owned liquidity: seJUNO/JUNO on Wynd DEX

# Proposal

This proposal is requesting 1,000,000 $JUNO from the Juno Community pool to the seJUNO/JUNO pool as [Protocol owned liquidity](https://medium.com/wynddao/can-protocol-owned-wynd-replace-external-incentives-477e45cb1086) introduced by [WyndDAO](https://wynddao.com/). 500,000 $JUNO will be converted to seJUNO and it will be deposited to [seJUNO/JUNO pool](https://app.wynddao.com/pools/juno177xtcl6dax47kg3xptr5n48kd7twmzm49ltugfxuc76x9v05qq6q63hsm9) on wyndDEX. The tokens will not be bonded (though this can be changed via Juno governance).

StakeEasy, the first liquid staking solution that has been live on the Juno network for 8 months and has proven to be a reliable and effective staking platform. Currently, StakeEasy has a total value locked (TVL) of 109,000 $JUNO tokens which has been raised organically.

# Benefits

1. This bootstraps the adoption of LSD assets on Juno as a whole which will drive tremendous value and TVL to Juno from other projects and ecosystems. The proposal will result in the overall development of the Juno ecosystem, with StakeEasy and Wynd DEX both benefiting from increased liquidity.

2. The Juno community pool currently holds 16,067,447 $JUNO. This is losing 20% of its value this year due to the inflation rate. Half will be staked as seJUNO which enables the community pool to earn revenue.

3. There will be no negative price impact to JUNO because it is a seJUNO/JUNO pair which creates no sell pressure.

4. The Juno community will retain full control over these assets. There will be extremely limited IL due to the setup of the Staking Swap pool.

5. The establishment of deep liquidity in the seJUNO/JUNO pool paves the way for vast DeFi opportunities on Juno and is expected to drive more LSD and DeFi adoption through current and future project synergies.

6. We believe that our proposal is a win-win situation for everyone involved. By supporting our proposal, you will be contributing to the growth and development of the Juno ecosystem. We hope that you will consider our proposal and support us in this endeavor.

# About stakeEasy

1. **Reliable and Trustworthy**: StakeEasy has been live on the Juno network for months and has proven to be a reliable and effective staking platform reaching a TVL of 400K $JUNO a few months back.

2. **Low Fees**: StakeEasy charges comparatively low fees i.e. 5%, making it a more attractive option for staking JUNO and the organic growth speaks volumes about our reliability and trustworthiness.

3. **Strong Presence on DEXes and other DeFi**: StakeEasy had a strong presence on the Juno Network's decentralized exchange (DEX) JunoSwap, with pools ranked in the top 10 in terms of liquidity. However, after JunoSwap's failure, the liquidity has been migrated to Wynd DEX. With that we have liquidity pools on Loop DEX as well.

4. **Partnership Opportunities**: StakeEasy is open to collaborating with other projects and protocols in the Juno ecosystem, which can result in more opportunities for growth and development. However, there is still much more that can be done to strengthen the ecosystem and promote further growth.

5. **Open source**: The source code for the stakeEasy liquid staking contract is open-source and can be found [here](https://github.com/arufa-research/stakeeasy-juno-contracts). These contracts have been extensively tested with unit/integration tests and been battle tested on juno's mainnet for last 8 months. The integration tests can be found [here](https://github.com/arufa-research/stakeeasy-juno-contracts/tree/master/test).

6. **Upcoming gauges system**: The stakeEasy dev team is in testing phase on the new gauge based validator selection system which futher decentralizes the validator set selected for liquid staking.

# Plan of action

Community pool tokens from Juno will be sent to a seJUNO/JUNO PoL multi-sig address that will then allocate token to the liquidity pools. This subDAO will also maintain custody of the LP position unless a governance proposal from Juno dictates otherwise.

Multisig members are:

1. Rarma (Community member)
2. 360Bilal (Community member)
3. giansalex (Disperze validator)
4. CommunityStaking validator
5. Udit (StakeEasy developer)

Multisig can be viewed here: [https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1ev4dfsh7uhrpclrj2gr7tx4pq5kl3gxju7s980r3mzgp6g9z625qfxur6y](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1ev4dfsh7uhrpclrj2gr7tx4pq5kl3gxju7s980r3mzgp6g9z625qfxur6y)

"WYND DEX External Incentives for WYND/JUNO Pool

**Summary**

In February, the WYND team initiated a discussion on the Juno Commonwealth seeking external incentives. We listened to the feedback of the Juno community and decided to submit proposals for individual pools as we continue to prove ourselves the Juno community. You can find the [full discussion on Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/10178-wynd-dex-external-incentives-for-juno-pairs)

The WYND team is requesting 90,000  to be distributed as incentives in the WYND/USDC pool over the next three months. Increasing liquidity in this pool will have bond WYND and JUNO further as well as increase trading fees generated for both community pools due to the [prior POL](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/141).

With the launch of WYND DEX and LSD within 2 months and continued growth and development since, WYND has proven itself to be a valuable contributor to Juno's growth and a committed builder. WYND is requesting incentives for a three month period rather than a year, thus enabling the Juno community to continually evaluate our contributions.

**Voting**

YES - You agree to provide 90,000  from the Junoswap incentives multisignature wallet as external incentives for the WYND/JUNO pool on WYND DEX over the following three months
NO - You don't agree to provide 90,000  from the Junoswap incentives multisignature wallet as external incentives for the WYND/JUNO pool on WYND DEX over the following three months
ABSTAIN - You formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal
NO WITH VETO - You would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their 1000 JUNO deposit, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.

"Waive Fees for Ojo Network Oracle

# Waive Fees for Ojo Network Oracle 
 Commonwealth post: https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/11612-waive-fees-for-ojo-network-oracle 
 Ojo has deployed a push-model price oracle contract to the Juno chain which broadcasts updates about every 15s. We plan on being the premiere price oracle for Juno and the rest of the Cosmos; 60+ assets will be added to these feeds over the course of time, many of which will be cosmos-native assets such as liquid staking tokens, stablecoins, and LP tokens. This also includes our Historacle offering, which provides contextual data about these price feeds for DeFi dApps to make safer decisions on the types of transactions to allow. This has become very expensive due to the recent gas changes on Juno with Proposal 297. 
 Ojo is requesting that Juno waives our gas fees for price feed transactions to the following contract, up to 5,000,000 gas per transaction: juno1yqm8q56hjv8sd4r37wdhkkdt3wu45gc5ptrjmd9k0nhvavl0354qwcf249 
 If this proposal passes, Juno leadership has agreed to implement and include this change in the next chain upgrade. 

 ## Yes 
 Vote YES on this proposal to support waiving gas fees for Ojo price feed updates. 
 ## No 
 Vote NO on this proposal to oppose waiving gas fees for Ojo price feed updates.

Times have been difficult for validators as token value has gone down and retail and institutional clients have decided to unstake. We think that having a uniform minimum commission can help validators get the right compensation for their work.

Other benefits around having a min. commission rate is that validators will need to compete on value creation for delegators, instead of attracting them due to low or 0% commission rate. Delegators will be able to delegate among various validators and help decentralize the network.

Here are other examples of networks that have set a minimum commission rate for validators: Umee, Desmos, Juno, Osmosis, Chihuahua.

"EVM Infrastructure Funding Proposal

## Summary

Tharsis, the team of engineering architects, owners, and core maintainers of the [Ethermint EVM library](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint) that powers [Kava’s Ethereum co-chain](https://medium.com/kava-labs/kava-10-kava-network-1-0-ba9195a029b7), is requesting 3M out of ~80M KAVA tokens (~3.7%) from the Community Pool Treasury to fund, develop and advance critical EVM Infrastructure through the Ethermint Engineering and R&D team for 1 year.

The Tharsis team will use these resources to grow the existing Ethermint engineering team, so Tharsis can take on the commitments and responsibilities necessary to keep maintaining and supporting the Ethermint [code repository](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint) and to implement new functionalities for the EVM.

**NOTE**: This is a summarized version of the proposal, for more details check the full proposal description [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/wsa37v/evm_infrastructure_funding_proposal_on_kava/).


## Context

The Tharsis team is requesting **3M KAVA** tokens, an approximate value of $5.45M USD at the time of writing, from the Kava Community pool to continue to maintain and drastically improve the critical infrastructure that powers the Ethermint EVM library, and thus one of the core value propositions of the Kava Platform’s Ethereum Co-Chain.

Tharsis will utilize the funding for

1. **Hiring, managing, and training** relevant Tharsis personnel whose role will encompass:
    1. Maintenance: Maintaining Ethermint and all its components
    2. Research and Development: Research and implement new functionalities and use cases for the EVM.
2. **Performance Improvements**: Improve performance of the Ethermint EVM and clients such as JSON-RPC and WebSockets.
3. **Stability Improvements**: Ensure the EVM equivalence with go-ethereum through rigorous testing.
4. **Security Improvements**: Run bug bounties and white-hat hacker programs to detect and fix potential security vulnerabilities. Tharsis will also hire engineers to work on Quality Assurance (QA) of the Etheremint EVM library.

Tharsis firmly believes that by delivering on the items outlined in this proposal, users and developers on the Kava Platform will benefit from a better UX, improved performance and new use cases enabled by the custom functionalities from the Ethermint EVM. This will create a net positive outcome for both teams working on the EVM on Cosmos.

* **YES**: You approve the proposal statements and distribution of 3M KAVA to the multisig address. The treasury will allocate the funds to the Tharsis team, leading Ethermint’s core R&D, educational, infrastructure, and hiring efforts for the Ethermint EVM for the duration of 1 year. It will also lead to core technology maintenance and continuous discussion to ensure the project’s longevity.
* **NO**: The NO vote is a request for improvements or adjustments. You agree that this proposal’s motivation is valuable and that the team should create a follow-up proposal with the corresponding amendments.
* **NO (VETO)**: You veto the entire motivation for the proposal. The Tharsis team will look for alternatives to ensure the long-term alignment between projects that use the Ethermint EVM implementation.
* **ABSTAIN**: You are impartial to the outcome of this proposal.

"Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development, Addressed from The Evmos Community to The Kava Community

**This is an inter-chain diplomacy proposal for the Evmos Community to ask the Kava Community to reward [Ethermint past development efforts](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/graphs/contributors) (done until October 1st 2022), with 1.25M (1,250,000) EVMOS. The equivalent amount in $KAVA is 1,326,013 $KAVA (calculated at $1.57 $EVMOS, $1.48 $KAVA). The entire amount will be sent to an Evmos Community controlled multisig.**

Discussion: [https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xyxr1o/prevotelast_version_ethermint_funding_proposal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xyxr1o/prevotelast_version_ethermint_funding_proposal/).

The initial request (2.5M $EVMOS) was reduced to 1.25M $EVMOS. Comments on [Kava Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xpll7c/comment/iqixeqd/?context=3), [Kava Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xpll7c/comment/irblgcg/?%2524deep_link=true&correlation_id=ead1bae1-408e-4789-898d-dd68ad5f6698), [Evmos Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6867-external-ethermint-funding-proposal-on-kava-price-discovery-vote?comment=30837), [Evmos Governance Council](https://youtu.be/4oTZyf0SNwE?t=1840). 

$KAVA tokens will be used to buy $EVMOS. On Evmos, the 1.25M $EVMOS will be used for Ethermint development, following a similar procedure to Evmos Grants:

1. stake the $EVMOS to active validators that have under 0.66% voting power, to improve Evmos's Nakamoto Coefficient (the beneficiary, Tharsis, will select the validators)
2. fund Ethermint development from staking rewards
3. Recommendations: 
 - 3.1. the equivalent of 0.25M $EVMOS (in $KAVA) can be used to provide $KAVA liquidity to Evmos DEXes.
 - 3.2. $KAVA -> $EVMOS swap to be done in Evmos DEXes, to the extent possible. This is out of respect for the Kava Community, to have a gradual token swap.
 - 3.3. *_The Evmos Community multisig signers will lead the above processes and decision-making and will forward $EVMOS to a Tharsis-owned account, for staking._

"Revive IBC Client to Oppy Chain

## Summary

Through accepting this proposal, the expired IBC Tendermint client' 07-tendermint-15' will be revived (or activated) to interconnect the Cosmos SDK blockchains kava_2222-10 (i.e., Kava mainnet) and oppyChain-1 (i.e., Oppy Chain mainnet).


## Current Situation

To be trustworthy, the consensus state of these clients needs to be periodically updated by IBC relayers. However, if the relayers seize their work or the relying chain is terminated, the clients can expire due to their out-of-date consensus state and will be frozen. After being frozen, updating the consensus state of the expired client becomes impossible. As a result, transferring assets through the corresponding channel become impossible and the asset transferred through the channel will be 'frozen' as well.
In our case, due to our misconfiguration used to create the client, the client expired and the asset transferred through the corresponding channel was frozen. 


## Solution

The ibc-go implementation of the IBC protocol in the Kava Chain exposes a type of governance proposal (i.e., update-client) that enables a community to reactivate an expired/frozen Tendermint client. When such a proposal passes, the state of another (but active and updateable) Tendermint client, which is available on both chains gets copied into the expired client, thus reactivating the expired one. It is to establish this reactivation function that this governance proposal is about.


## Governance Votes

YES = The canonical Tendermint client 07-tendermint-15, which interconnects oppyChain-1 (Oppy Chain) and kava_2222-10 will get updated with the state of another active Tendermint client (07-tendermint-49).
NO = The Tendermint client 07-tendermint-15 remains expired/frozen. This option shows the community's intention that it does not want a functioning IBC connection between Kava Chain and Oppy Chain.
ABSTAIN = You formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.


## Risks:

There are no significant risks to this proposal being accepted. Passing this proposal can reactivate the connection between KAVA Chain and Oppy Chain and also release 'trapped' Kava on Oppy Chain. Furthermore, reactivating the expired client could bring interoperability and shows the world that Kava is an open, generous, and trustworthy community that welcomes all the chains and projects to join the Kava ecosystem and gives them support when needed.

The objective of this proposal is to reward early users of the Red Bank with governance power to ensure that they have a strong voice in the parameterization of the Mars protocol in the future. In order to do so, such users will be rewarded with MARS tokens as set forth herein.

## Motivation

This proposal intends to keep interest and activity in the Red Bank by rewarding the deposits of OSMO, ATOM, and axlUSDC into the Red Bank.

## Specification

This rewards program sets out the distribution of rewards for each of the three assets listed on Red Bank.

| Asset   | Deposit Rewards (MARS) |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| OSMO    | 1.5M                   |
| ATOM    | 400k                   |
| axlUSDC | 100k                   |

## Risks

There is no guarantee that MARS recipients retain their MARS or use it in governance.

## Implementation

The duration of this program is strictly for 60 days only. The program should go live on Thursday, March 9th 2023 at 18:15:01 UTC, soon after the current rewards program ends.

The MARS community fund is held on the Mars Hub blockchain. Accordingly, if the proposal is approved, the required MARS would be IBC’d to Osmosis from the Mars Hub and directed to the MARS rewards contract.

"Fix IBC transfers between Lum Network and Osmosis

Lum Network IBC channel is currently in a frozen state following the Osmosis chain halt of the past few days.
This issue is known and has already been dealt with successfully in January 2022 where it was heavily tested prior to making a governance proposal.

The detail of the previous unfreeze operation is available here: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/115

Lum Team is now ready to proceed with a new channel unfreeze to restore connection between Lum & Osmosis.

**Proposal goal:**

This proposal will enable the unfreezing process of the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network, thus allowing deposits and withdrawals of **$LUM** on the Osmosis platform:

- By voting **YES**, OSMO stakers voice their support in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network
- By voting **NO**, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network

This proposal has no effect beside enabling back the IBC connection between the two chains.

**Details:**

The IBC client refresh between Osmosis and the Lum Network was not possible during the Osmosis shutdown.
Shutting down the IBC connection froze the currently use channel (3-115). Meaning that no IBC transfer can be made using this channel unless this governance proposal is voted YES by OSMO stakers.
The process to enable IBC transfers back require to substitute the current IBC client by a new one that is not in an expired state. ",0.295730810227909

"Set Initial Liquidity Mining Incentives

This proposal provides initial incentives for pools.

It sets the initial distribution of incentives allocation points. It allocates 5% of the LP incentives to the community pool.

The rest is based upon the current TVL for each pool. ATOM/OSMO has the most liquidity, so we have it at 25%. For the remaining pools, we split the incentives evenly between the ATOM and OSMO pools. The AKT pools have the next most liquidity, so we add them at 25% total, split between the two 12.5% pools. After that is the XPRT pools, so its 20%, split across both. Then DVPN at 15%. Not much liquidity has arrived for IRIS or CRO, so we set them to 4% of the allocation points each.  Finally, we allocated 2% to these ION things…  Whatever they are…

Osmosis has capabilites for incentivizing passive liquidity. Correspondingly, 80% of the allocation points are dedicated to people who bond their LP shares for at least 1 day. 15% who bond for at least 7 days, and 5% for those who bond at least 14 days. (So if you bond for 14 days, you get the rewards for 1 day, 7 day, and 14 day)",0.0033699677812225604

This proposal provides an upgrade to the current OSMO incentives for liquidity pools to account for the addition of the REGEN pools into the OSMOSIS DEX, following the successful Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool.

We propose that the total number of points allocated per Epoch is increase by 12% and that those points are distributed evenly to the REGEN/ATOM pool (#22) and the REGEN/OSMO pool (#42).
We propose that the 5% allocation to the community pool stays the same, and that the 2% allocation to the ION pool stays the same, and that the rest of the pools are diluted to accommodate this additional 12%.

"Switch to Intended Prop 6 incentives + Community Pool Adjustment

Proposal 6, a proposal that got passed offering a change in incentives distributions in order to include Regen pools, had a data entry error that differed from the proposal text. This error went uncaught in the governance approval process, and was approved and included on chain. This highlights the need for more tooling and standards being set here for ensuring that any manual adjustments to OSMO pool incentives get much more auditability.

Proposal 6 was passed in the last epoch at the time of this proposal's writing. This proposal offers a governance proposal to align the ratios with what was proposed in proposal 6, except with the following modification:

The Community pool allocation from LP incentives is lowered from 5% to 1%, with the remaining 4% being distributed evenly across all pools with lower than expected allocations per the text of prop 6.
This is namely every incentivized pool, except for the OSMO/ION, ATOM/REGEN, and OSMO/REGEN.
This is done as a means of accounting for the lower than expected rewards in the interrim. Please note that the baseline 5% of community pool rewards from minting is unchanged

Alternatively, the community could equally vote on a new incentives distribution, such as is proposed in proposal 8, or a new proposal based on current TVL similar to proposal 2.

 One important thing to remark is that it is plausible that this proposal and proposal 8 both enter their voting period during the same epoch. If this is the case, only one should be voted yes. (As whichever one gets passed second will override the other within the same epoch)

"Distribute LP rewards for epoch that ended at 2021-06-23 (Revised)

TL;DR:
We propose to distribute LP rewards for the epoch that ended at 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC to those that were bonded just before 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC.

Proposal:
This proposal seeks to equitably reward early liquidity providers (""ELPs"") who failed to receive the liquidity mining rewards that were communicated by the Osmosis Team. Proposal #2 for initiation of liquidity mining incentives for bonded liquidity providers passed on 2021-06-23 16:52 UTC. Prior to Proposal #2 passing, the Osmosis Team issued the following message: ""Note that users can begin bonding their LP tokens even though liquidity incentives haven’t been enabled yet, and their first LP reward will be distributed at 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC.""
Discord link: https://discord.com/channels/798583171548840026/842477665860583434/856777198442774569
Skylink: https://skygallery.hns.skyportal.xyz/#/a/AABDv3g-2RYw1FbuF8BDn2yKyjS_5jMOrSVkS-KdWTQfoQ

Based upon that and other messages, the community (including the Osmosis Team) believed that ELPs would receive their portion of the newly initiated liquidity mining rewards at the close of that epoch. ELPs assumed significant risk by providing liquidity and bonding their tokens at a time when overall liquidity on Osmosis was a small fraction of what it is today. Unfortunately, ELPs received no rewards for their service. The Osmosis Team acknowledges this miscommunication and recommended that the community submit a governance proposal to distribute the rewards from the community pool to ELPs. ELPs experienced substantial impermanent loss, price slippage, and lost opportunity cost of capital. ELPs rightfully expected liquidity rewards for these risks by providing the earliest and most important liquidity on the platform, especially considering the miscommunication from the Osmosis Team. Instead, ELPs performed worse than those who retained liquid capital and bonded later when there was less risk, less slippage and more volume (at the expense of ELPs). This result is inequitable and contrary to the ethos of Osmosis.

Should this proposal pass, the liquidity rewards will be distributed to applicable recipients from the community pool after a future software upgrade performed by the Osmosis Team. We thank you for your consideration.

Note:
This proposal is a revision of proposal #11, which proposed to distribute 20% of the rewards to current LPs. Following discussions with community members (particularly on Discord), a strong opinion was that a 20% concession would set a bad precedent. The issue is that, regardless of what the intention is, rewarding other LPs in this context is essentially vote buying. We strongly believe that proposals for community spending should be free of bribes.",0.025929843669769508

"Double the block gas limits

This proposal increases the block gas limit to 120M, from the existing 60M. 

We are currently frequently hitting block gas limits, even though the native execution times remain quite low. We see that we're frequently getting 10-20 trades per block, with block's nearing the gas limit. (Due to several affects, not just low gas limit, but the gas limit is still a part of it)

Furthermore, the bonding & unbonding of LP shares for yield farming still takes a lot of gas, even though its fixed in the subsequent chain software version. Bonding of LP shares is nearing 30M gas per tx (until the next upgrade). For unbonding it depends on how many locks its trying to unbond at once. (~25M each atm) Increasing the limit should improve UX, without notably increasing the block times. In the future, if we find that we're getting into execution time limits per block, we should start tuning per-tx gas parameters and optimizing the code to improve these speeds. The chain should _absolutely_ be able to support 100+ trades per block, and we need our gas limits to be able to reflect this. I propose that only if the chain starts seeing too high of an execution time per block, and a software patch would take too long, do we start tuning down the block gas limit.",0.0024261016663004917

"Would you be open to a clawback of 'unclaimed' ION?

This is a simple signaling proposal just to determine if the Osmosis community is open to the idea of synchronizing the ION airdrop with the OSMO airdrop so that 80% of 'unclaimed' Ions would be reclaimed at the end of the 6 month airdrop claim window with the intent to use them for the betterment of the zone.

'Unclaimed' ION are defined as wallets which have a Sequence Number = 0, which means the address has NOT performed a single action during the 6 month airdrop claim window.

As of this drafting there are 17,331 ION that meet the above definition for being 'unclaimed' or ~81% of the TOTAL supply.  Code used to provide these numbers can be found here: https://github.com/Nostradamus411/unclaimed-ions 

My assessment of the conversations being had in the Ion Governance Community are that there are two primary drivers for considering a clawback:

1) Many of the utility ideas being explored have a foundation in Ion being used as a governance token and the specter of such a large % of the total supply being inactive would present substantial risks.
2) A burning desire to put everything we can into making the Osmosis Zone the BEST it can possibly be!  Rather than leaving these tokens to fossilize unutilized, in what are likely abandoned wallets, they should instead be reclaimed and put to a more productive use.

If this proposal passes then there will be follow up proposal(s) to clearly define the criteria, method, and allocations of an ION clawback.

If you vote YES on this please join the discussion in the Ion Commonwealth https://commonwealth.im/ion/proposal/discussion/1525-addressing-the-dead-wallets and share your thoughts on how to best utilize any clawback to support Osmosis in becoming the greatest AMM in all of cryptoosmosisd tx gov submit-proposal

"Remove the proposer bonus lottery

Parameter change proposal to set baseproposerreward & bonusproposerreward params to ZERO to remove the undesireable centralization incentive it creates.

There is a detailed writeup on the  Osmosis Commonwealth why we should pass this proposal : https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/1688-remove-the-proposer-bonus-lottery

****REPRINTED BELOW****
Currently 1-5% of epoch rewards go to the validator (and their delegators) who proposed the epoch block. The exact percentage depends on details of how many validators were counted as online at the epoch block. This is an unfair system for a number of reasons, and introduces a force to centralize stake amongst the validators who already have the most stake. This is because:

1. (In theory) The chance of a validator being the proposer is proportional to their stake, which means you have the same expected return, but lower variance with larger validators. This gives an incentive to delegate to the largest validators. (There is a similar effect in POW mining systems like Bitcoin, which leads to pools)
2. In practice, the chance of a validator being the epoch proposer is 0 if they are not in the top 66% (by stake) of fastest validators. Only the validators who finish computing the block first will be potential proposers for it. This also contributes to centralization, as the largest validators can most afford to maximize their speed.
3. The proposer selection algorithm is not based on secure randomness, it isn’t even random at all. It is in fact highly manipulable. There are known strategies validator operators could use to attempt to propose a specific block. Actual usage of these strategies could be considered byzantine behavior, and could lead to further network instability around the epoch time.

This centralization effect is harmful to the long term success of the network – we want the stake distribution to become much less top heavy. Stake distribution has been decentralizing nicely as time has gone in the network, but it would be ideal to further accelerate this decentralization. And whats critical to that, is at minimum, lowering the incentive for the stake to centralize at the top. We are nowhere near the end state yet for stake distribution!

--Short Term Suggestion--

Create a parameter change proposal to set the proposer bonus to 0%. This would then go into affect immediately after the proposal passes.

--Long Term Suggestion--

This is definitely a conversation that needs to be designed together over time!
Talking with @UnityChaos & @dogemos, we thought it’d be cool to re-introduce this proposer bonus lottery, but have it only be applicable to the bottom {say} 50 validators. Also have the total pot of the reward not be 5%, but instead be around {say} 1% of the reward. This would help incentivize decentralization of the network, and also retain the (accidentally introduced) lottery effect that so many folks like! (Since delegating to smaller validators would be higher EV!)

It is possible that higher stake validators sybil themselves into multiple lower stake validators. The hope is that the pot here is sufficiently low, that this won’t be worth the reputational hit that the sybilling validator would take. (And would also cause community uproar, justifying a governance proposal to slash them) There is still a fear that the big validator makes multiple sybils anonymously, this is quite plausible if its all their own funds. Noticeability only really comes in when its from validators gathering delegations from users, or are trying to build a common brand.

The blocker for re-introducing this epoch reward lottery this is we need a secure on-chain randomness source. (In addition to design work to ensure sybilling incentivizes are sufficiently low) This can be added as a follow-on to the threshold decryption work that is being worked on. The threshold decryption work eliminates most of the known forms of MEV learned about from Ethereum, such as front-running, sandwitching, stealing arbs, etc. – making them unable to applied on Osmosis once its done. It turns out that the technical primitive underlying this is very well suited for making a secure on-chain randomness source.",0.02133950137958233
"Clawback ALL unclaimed ION & OSMO to Community Pool after airdrop decay period?

The passing of Prop #29 generated plenty of further community discussion on how to go about enacting a clawback and how to utilize it. This proposal seeks to build upon the initial consensus achieved and separate the vote on an execution framework for a clawback from any specific uses for clawedback tokens.

***Reminder***
'Unclaimed' tokens are defined as being in wallets which have a Sequence Number = 0, which means the address has NOT performed a single action during the 6 month airdrop claim window.

******CLAWBACK PROPOSED FRAMEWORK******
TLDR -- Send ALL unclaimed ION & OSMO back to the community pool and prune those inactive wallets from current state.

This proposal has three key updates to highlight from the prior proposal:

1)  This is to vote for ALL unclaimed Ion be clawedback, not just 80% as was suggested in Prop #29 as an approach to synchronize Ion/Osmo airdrops.
2)  Clawing back the 20% of OSMO which sit in inactive wallets has been included.  Reclaiming the idle stagnating OSMO's to support the future betterment of the Osmosis Zone seems a logical extension of the consensus to clawback unclaimed Ions.  This also will keep the airdrops in alignment where both are reclaimed entirely at the end of the decay window.
3)  Pruning of the addresses from state makes complete sense because they will be totally empty and would otherwise just be unnecessarily requiring storage space.",0.027520433358200574

"Osmosis v4 Berylium Upgrade

# Osmosis v4 Berylium Chain Upgrade



Rendered: https://hackmd.io/L2dgE1yJT22uP8bgHXnZLg?view



This upgrade is a large stability upgrade to Osmosis. It brings with it faster epochs, and improved computation time for various on-chain operations, and fixes to the high gas amounts needed for bonding and unbonding txs.



The features of this upgrade are:



* Fixing gas issues for bonding and unbonding tokens (NOTE: issues at epoch of there just being super high amounts of activity may still persist, with it taking seconds for txs to get into a block)

* Removing the need for users to withdraw locked tokens once they are finished unlocking

* Adding a governance parameter for a minimum fee to create a pool.

* Implements prop 12



See more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v4.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)



### Getting prepared for the upgrade



Follow the cosmovisor setup instructions here: https://github.com/osmosis-labs/networks/blob/main/osmosis-1/upgrades/cosmovisor.md



Namely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the osmosisd v4.0.0 binary to .osmosisd/cosmovisor/v4/bin/.



### Details of upgrade time



When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine of the Osmosis will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to v4.0.0, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.



The proposal sets the upgrade proposal block at #1314500, which

is anticipated to be at Friday 2PM UTC (10AM EST). This is figured using the 7 day average block time of 6.45 seconds per block. Note that block times are highly variable, and this time estimate could very well be off by a couple of hours, due to live network conditions.



The upgrade is anticipated to take 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.



In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.



### Testing your upgrade setup



There is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See #testnet-announcements and #testnet-discussion channels in the Osmosis Discord.

Proposal: Sponsor 4,000 OSMO to the Cosmoverse 2021 Conference in Lisbon?

Description
Cosmoverse 2021 (https://cosmoverse.org/) is a community-led conference that will take place in Lisbon, Portugal on November 5th, 2021. Due to unprecedented demand, we are going to expand the conference for an additional day, turning it into a two-day conference from November 5-6.

Objective
Cosmoverse is held to raise awareness of Cosmos and its vibrant ecosystem. Hundreds of Cosmonauts from all over the world will unite to learn and network at Cosmoverse.
The team:

Cosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.

During late October and early November, Lisbon is going to be full with Crypto-specific events and conferences.

Cosmoverse takes place in between ETH Lisbon and Solana, which means that attendees from these events will have the opportunity to join us, too.

Livestream
For those that are unable to attend, there will be a livestream broadcasting of the event, in collaboration with OmniFlix. A professional camera setup and videographers are already arranged. We will create specific in-stream content in advance to provide a seamless experience for online-viewers.
Event Highlights
Cosmoverse is organized by the community, for the community. We managed to onboard reputable speakers from the Cosmos ecosystem, such as Sunny Aggarwal, Billy Rennekamp, Alessio Treglia, Federico Kunze-Küllmer, Brent Xu, Gregory Landua or Felix Lutsch, but also high-profile speakers from the broader Cryptoverse such as Meltem Demirors, Tegan Kline, Marc Zeller and more.

As we get closer to the event, we will try to embed more exciting things that will make Cosmoverse a great success. Follow us on Twitter and join the chat on Telegram to stay up-to-date and STAY TUNED :)


Budget & post-conference report

If this proposal passes, 4,000 OSMO (worth ~ $20,000 as of today according to Coingecko) will be allocated to help make this event a great success.

The lead sponsor for the conference is the Cosmos Hub with marketing funds from proposal #46 “Luna Mission,” but we require additional resources to pay for:
Audio visuals / logistics
Day 2 venue + catering

Afterparty
Printing banners
Marketing materials
Online marketing and coverage
We are going to publish a detailed report on the budget-spent after the conference occurred. Given that Cosmoverse was just an idea ~5 weeks ago and things are moving incredibly fast, the cost and budget planning is one of the hardest tasks for us at the moment.

In addition, given that we are just a team of 6-enthusiastic Cosmonauts without a company that could bail us out, we need to be incredibly cautious with our finances and avoid illiquidity.

The main cost-factors for this event (for 320 people) are:
Venue incl. catering: ~ $36,500 per day
AV + branding: ~ $34,200 total
Afterparty: ~ $20,000
Additional expenses: tbd
Team expenses: tbd
Team compensation: tbd

The cost for the venue would increase by ~$19,000 per day if we could host 500 guests instead of 320.

In case there is going to be a profit left, we plan to use this as starting liquidity for the next Cosmoverse conference.

Current sponsors are:
Cosmos Hub community pool ($34,000)
Citizen Cosmos ($5,000)
Stargaze ($5,000)
Sentinel ($5,000)
Regen Network ($5,000)
Umee ($5,000)
e-Money ($5,000)
Commercio ($5,000)

Cosmoverse is a community-effort that is financed in a hybrid manner by companies and DAOs. The first one ever? In the future, we envision Cosmoverse to become a fully DAO-funded endeavor that will take place annually.


Tickets
The goal is also to keep the ticket prices extremely affordable (from 39€) which is very competitive to other crypto-conferences happening in Lisbon around the same time (tickets cost up to €1,000). The ticket also includes F&B throughout both days at the conference as well as access and F&B at the afterparty venue. Our goal is to provide as much value as possible for attending Cosmonauts, while also investing funds into media coverage to provide high-quality, free broadcasting of the event. Each presentation will also be recorded and published on Youtube.

The Osmosis core team has been an early proponent and supporter of Cosmoverse and is also receiving exposure at the event.
If the proposal is accepted, Osmosis will become a sponsor of Cosmoverse 2021.

This includes:
Online and print visibility
Keynote slot on Day 1 (presentation by Josh Lee)
Panel slot on Day 2 (topic + panelists tbd)
1x high table at the conference in the exhibition area
1x stand up banner placed in the networking area
Promotion in relevant news outlets",0.0019061984488096446
"Increase Pool Creation Fee to 100 osmo

With the passage of Prop 38 and the successful integration of the Osmosis v4: Berylium Upgrade, the pool creation fee chain parameter has been added to Osmosis. The pool creation fee is currently set to 1 uosmo (essentially $0). This proposal aims to raise the pool creation fee to 100 osmo (~ $575 at time of drafting).

***FEE DESTINATION***
Per existing on-chain parameters the pool creation fee will be sent to the Osmosis community pool.

***PURPOSE : Prevent Spam Pool Creation***
Implementing a 100 osmo pool creation fee will have the practical effect of preventing people from adding very small amounts of liquidity to a pool for the sole purpose of testing the pool creation function and then pulling it out immediately thereafter, leaving behind an abandoned pool with less than $0.01 in TVL.

This will also ensure that any pools added to Osmosis are included for the purpose of adding long-term liquidity to the DEX.

"Add Incentive Matching to Prop 13 Model

I propose that we extend the model currently used for semi-automatic incentive adjustments to include an Incentive Matching program, where we match external incentives paid to liquidity pools on Osmosis. Such as the previous program by Akash, current one by E-Money, and proposed one by Juno https://juno.aneka.io/proposals/1

Under the current process, new pool creators are asked to create Text Proposals so that we can come to consensus about whether or not these pools should begin receiving Osmo incentives following the Prop 13 model and on-boarding process.

Under the proposed new process, pool creators would create Text Proposals asking for governance agreement to add the pools to the model, but also to match a certain amount of external incentives that they plan to provide. For an approved pool with external incentives, the model would set a minimum incentive share with Osmo to match the USD value of the external incentives.

These incentive matches would be decided by governance on a case by case basis, and should be limited to some overall % of Osmo Incentives. I propose that we start with a soft limit of 20% of incentives, so matching no more than ~400,000 USD per day of external incentives.

I also propose that we begin by matching the external incentives currently being paid by E-Money to pools 461, and 482. As well as the proposed Juno incentives on pools 497, and 498. These external incentives amount to a total of ~36,000 USD per day, or 1.9% of incentives at current prices.

If this proposal is approved, we will begin using the new spreadsheet for regular adjustment proposals starting October 11th 2021, and these pools will have their external incentives at least matched.

If this proposal is not approved, we will continue with the Prop 13 model without matching. As Juno pools are already approved for incentives, they will begin on-boarding regardless of which outcome is decided here.

"Add Incentives to Osmo/Ust and Osmo/Luna

This proposal would give a 0.5% incentive share to pools 560 (Osmo/Ust) and 561 (Osmo/Luna) which would start paying out on the epoch of October 26. This would allow these pools to gain incentives sooner than they would following the standard process (October 29).

These incentive shares would be taken from the 1% of LP incentives currently paid to the community pool (so as not to disrupt the incentives of existing pools or the regular process).

If passed, these pools will be added to the regular adjustment proposal on October 25, but would start receiving incentives at this 0.5% rate on October 26, and would then be adjusted to the appropriate level on October 29 following passage of the regular adjustment proposal.

Signaling proposal for BCNA incentivized pools.
By voting YES to this proposal, OSMO stakers support adding OSMO incentives to BCNA-liquidity pools on Osmosis.

**Details**
This is a signaling proposal to include BCNA pairs into the set of assets that get OSMO liquidity incentives.

BCNA/OSMO (pool #571) and ATOM/BCNA (pool 572) trading pairs are live on Osmosis since Friday 29-10-2021. From the get-go these pools are incentivized by the BitCanna team (https://medium.com/@BitCannaGlobal/bitcanna-is-now-live-on-osmosis-dex-e67c2c83abbf) to boost rewards for taking part in the liquidity pools.

After this proposal has passed governance, the BCNA pools are added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and begin the onboarding.

"Signal Proposal: Community Spend proposal for getting Osmosis participate in HackAtom VI!

HackAtom VI is the biggest Hackatom in Cosmos history.  Osmosis, a core contributor to the Cosmos ecosystem, should participate as a sponsor to this event given that Osmosis originally started as the winning project of HackAtom V.

This is a proposal for the Osmosis Community Pool to allocate 50,000 USD to participate as a challenge sponsor to HackAtom VI.  A HackAtom sponsorship allows Osmosis governance to propose a hackathon challenge in one of the existing categories and use the full 50,000 USD sponsorship as prize pool money to pay the winners of the Osmosis challenge.  Examples of challenges from other projects can be found on the HackAtom website here:  https://hackatom.org 

The Osmosis challenge should be open-ended, giving builders the flexibility to explore their ideas and build something outstanding.  For that reason, we propose that the Osmosis challenge to be:  

“Build something cool with Osmosis. Bonus points if you incorporate ION.”

A YES vote on this proposal signals an agreement to allocate 50,000 USD from the community pool as HackAtom VI challenge prize sponsorship by the Osmosis community.

Should this proposal pass, a follow-through community pool spend proposal will be submitted on December 17, 2021 (with the USD value to be decided based on the closing price of OSMO on December 16, 2021) to distribute the prizes to the winners of the Osmosis challenge. 

The prize distribution will be managed by Tendermint Inc, the organizers of HackAtom VI.

"Signaling proposal for XKI incentivized pools

By voting YES to this proposal, OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:
 Adding OSMO incentives to XKI/OSMO and XKI/UST pools through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:
 Adding OSMO incentives to XKI-liquidity pools on Osmosis.

** Details **

The following proposal is a basic signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to include XKI pairs into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.

Regular XKI/OSMO and XKI/UST pools have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.

** Expected benefits **

The Liquidity Providers will then benefit from following incentives on OSMO/XKI & UST/XKI pools:
1. OSMO incentives for LP
2. SWAP Fees 

In order to incentivize more liquidity to be provided, the Ki Foundation will fund an additional incentive in XKI on the related pools.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s )

** About Ki & Klub **

Ki is offering the compliant gateway from the Fiat world to DeFi, through Klub Ki is building DeFi protocols that will live on top of Juno while being operated through interchain accounts of multiple chains.

"Signaling Proposal for XKI/JUNO incentivized pool

By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:
Adding OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:
Adding OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

The following proposal is a basic signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to include XKI/JUNO pair into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.

Regular XKI/JUNO pool have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.

** Expected benefits **

Should this proposal pass, the Liquidity Providers will then benefit from following incentives on JUNO/XKI pool:

1. OSMO incentives for LP
2. SWAP Fees

In order to incentivize more liquidity to be provided, the Ki Foundation will fund an additional incentive in XKI on the related pools. An additional incentive is considered in JUNO through onchain governance.

By supporting these benefits, you will help grow the XKI liquidity pools and strengthen both core assets of future DeFi Protocols such as Klub Yield as presented on the Cosmoverse conference ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43i9lHY0E08&t=31148s )

** About Ki & Klub **

Ki is offering the compliant gateway from the Fiat world to DeFi, through Klub Ki is building DeFi protocols that will live on top of Juno while being operated through interchain accounts of multiple chains.

"Match External Incentives for SCRT/ATOM and SCRT/OSMO pairs

**Background**
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47, the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

**Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the Secret Network community for the SCRT/ATOM and SCRT/OSMO pairs. 

-   By voting **YES** on this proposal, external SCRT incentives will be matched at ~$10,000 per day
-   By voting **NO** on this proposal, external SCRT incentives will NOT be matched at ~$10,000 per day

**Context**
The proposal for the external incentives went live on the Secret Network on November 20th, 2021 and is passing with unanimous approval: https://wallet.keplr.app/#/secret/governance?detailId=64. The discussion around the incentives can be seen here: https://forum.scrt.network/t/proposal-scrt-on-osmosis-early-pool-incentives-to-mitigate-slippage-and-boost-liquidity/4737. This proposal is for ~$5000 per day in SCRT distributed across both pairs, however if the Osmosis community chooses to match, SCRT Labs will make the SCRT incentive ~$10,000 per day.

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$10,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54, these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.

** Proposal Details **

This is a signaling proposal to include MED pools into the set of assets that get OSMO liquidity incentives.

The following liquidity pools have been live on Osmosis since 23 Nov 2021.
- MED/OSMO (Pool #586)
- MED/ATOM (Pool #587)

By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to these MED liquidity pools on Osmosis.
By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to these MED liquidity pools on Osmosis.

Also, the Panacea team is preparing an additional proposal for External MED Incentives in order to incentivize more liquidity to be provided.


** About Panacea & MediBloc **

Panacea is a Cosmos-based blockchain that has been launched in 2019 by MediBloc.
On top of Panacea, MediBloc is designing the generic data sharing/verification protocol, so that anyone can:
- issue various data in verifiable manners
- own their data securely
- present their data to someone to get benefits

Also, MediBloc is planning to extend that data protocol to the data market protocol, so that data owners can get incentivized transparently by providing their data securely to various data consumers.

For that vision, MediBloc has implemented core building blocks on Panacea, such as DID / VerifiableCredentials / SelectiveDisclosure using ZKP.
In near future, MediBloc is going to present the first version of the data sharing protocol publicly, so that it can be improved by various community members.

Furthermore, MediBloc has released Dr.palette EHR (Electronic Health Record) for hospitals and Medipass PHR (Electronic Health Record) for patients. Those applications would be the first players who boost the verifiable data sharing protocol. It means that MediBloc will show the first example that the protocol can be very useful in the healthcare field. It would be a great impact because healthcare data is not only one of the most inaccessible data types, but also requires many privacy concerns.

While MediBloc is developing those use-cases, we would like to maximize the liquidity of MED which will be used for the verifiable data protocol in near future.

"Increase max Rate of Incentive adjustment from 10% to 15%

*****Problem Statement*****

The Adjust Scale parameter of 10% used to dampen volatility in the weekly incentives adjustments algorithm is too low.  Pools are hitting this cap and either not having incentives drained or added quickly enough to reward the liquidity the market is valuing the most.

This could be detrimental to TVL growth as existing liquidity can become over incentivized while newer liquidity, more valued by the market, struggles to attain justified reward allocations.


*****Experimental Problem Solution*****

Incrementally increase the Adjust Scale parameter then monitor how frequently pools continue hitting the cap and assess if further increase proposals are warranted.  The hypothesis is that this variable should be turned up to probably 20%-25% but in multiple phases to allow for observation of the impacts.


*****Proposal*****

By voting YES on this proposal you signal approval to increase the Adjust Scale variable +5% (10% to 15%)

By voting NO on this proposal you signal dissent and want the Adjust Scale variable to remain at 10%

** Background **

As established in Osmosis Proposal #47: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47, the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

MED liquidity pools have been listed on Osmosis since 23 Nov 2021.

** Proposal Details **

This is a proposal to allocate ~$900,000-worth MEDs for MED/OSMO and MED/ATOM pools on Osmosis to be provided by MediBloc.
Also, this proposes for the Osmosis community to launch the Incentive Matching program for MED pools.
This helps increase liquidity and most importantly ensures that the price slippage can be reduced.

By voting YES on this proposal, external MED incentives will be matched at ~$5,000-worth MEDs per pool per day for 90 days.
By voting NO on this proposal, external MED incentives will NOT be matched at ~$5,000-worth MEDs per pool per day for 90 days.

The MediBloc has prepared 12,222,725 MED which is approximately equivalent to $900,000 based on the average market closing price for the last 7 days as of 26 Nov 2021 (according to the historical data of CoinMarketCap).

The MED incentives for each MED pool will be the following:
- MED/OSMO (Pool #586): ~67,904 MED per day for 90 days (~$5,000 approximately)
- MED/ATOM (Pool #587): ~67,904 MED per day for 90 days (~$5,000 approximately)

All MED used for these liquidity incentives will be matched with an equal value of OSMO incentives if this proposal is passed by the Osmosis community.

These will be split up into the following buckets for each bonding period:

"Cleanup & Refund < $1k TVL Pools

*****Problem Statement*****

Pool creation on Osmosis was free until Prop #45 passed and this proposal is a follow up, the result of free pool creation was that many scientists decided to run their own experiments with the functionality just to kick the tires on the process after which they would drain the pool of their funds leaving a few droplets of liquidity behind.  There are now >=600 pools on Osmosis, most of which are defunct due to the aforementioned early experimentation, this presents unnecessary UI complexity and noise for users with so many extraneous pools happering UX.


*****Problem Solution*****

During a future chain upgrade, dissolve all pools with less than $1,000 of TVL by refunding holders of those GAMM-# shares with the constituent tokens and destroy the pool.  All existing pools and GAMM shares will retain their current numbers and new pools will continue to be created by incrementing the current max pool number.

NOTE : Any GAMM shares which are IBC'd out of Osmosis would be STUCK if not brought back over to Osmosis before this cleanup!

Vote NO  -- to signal dissent and NOT alter state to cleanup any low TVL pools

The Comdex team has provided 3,000,000 CMDX across CMDX/ATOM pool 600 and CMDX/OSMO pool 601 amounting to ~$6,500,000 over the course of 90 epochs beginning Wednesday, December 8th and 12:00 UTC.

The CMDX incentives are as follows:
- CMDX/ATOM (Pool #600): ~16667 CMDX per day amounting to ~$36,000
- CMDX/OSMO (Pool #601): ~16667 CMDX per day amounting to ~$36,000

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$72,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/54, these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.

**Background**
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

**Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the BitSong team for BTSG/OSMO (pool 573), BTSG/ATOM (pool 574) and BTSG/UST (pool 592). External incentives have already begun and will continue for 30 epochs.

By voting NO on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will NOT be matched at ~$12,500 per day, at the current value of $0,25 x BTSG

**Context**
The BitSong team has provided a first batch of 1,500,000 BTSG across BTSG/OSMO pool 573, BTSG/ATOM pool 574 and BTSG/UST pool 592, amounting to ~$375,000, at the current value of $0,25 x BTSG, over the course of 30 epochs beginning Tuesday, November 30th at 00:00am UTC.

"Increase max Rate of Incentive adjustment from 15% to 20% (Round 2)

*****Problem Statement*****

The Adjust Scale parameter of used to dampen volatility in the weekly incentives adjustments algorithm is too low.  Pools are hitting this cap and either not having incentives drained or added quickly enough to reward the liquidity the market is valuing the most.

This could be detrimental to TVL growth as existing liquidity can become over incentivized while newer liquidity, more valued by the market, struggles to attain justified reward allocations.


*****Experimental Problem Solution*****

Incrementally increase the Adjust Scale parameter then monitor how frequently pools continue hitting the cap and assess if further increase proposals are warranted.  The hypothesis is that this variable should be turned up to probably 25% but in multiple phases to allow for observation of the impacts.


*****Proposal*****

By voting YES on this proposal you signal approval to increase the Adjust Scale variable +5% (15% to 20%)

By voting NO on this proposal you signal dissent and want the Adjust Scale variable to remain at 15%

"Osmosis v5 Boron Upgrade

# Osmosis v5 Boron Upgrade

 [Rendered](https://hackmd.io/tJHNqU_kRW6ZTdGNQNHlIQ?view) 

This proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the [v5.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0) software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `2383300`. The timing of this upgrade is crucial to properly execute the [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) airdrop clawback. This clawback should happen right at the Airdrop end date of December 15th 5PM UTC, thus this upgrade must execute before it. 

The upgrade block height `2383300` is estimated to be at December 14th, UTC 2:30PM. Block times have high variance, so please be monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. 

## Upgrade features

This upgrade adds features such as:

- Upgrade Cosmos-SDK to [SDK v0.44](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) from SDK v0.42 For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see its [changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21). Noteable highlights include:
    - [Authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) - Allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). 
- New modules:
    - [Bech32IBC](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/bech32-ibc) - Allows auto-routing of send msgs to addresses on other chains, once configured by governance. Allows you to do a bank send on Osmosis to a cosmos1... address, and it is automatically sent to the corresponding Cosmos Hub address over IBC. This is a big step in enabling more seemless IBC UX.
    - [TxFees](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees) - Enables validators to easily accept txfees in multiple assets, whitelisted by governance, by declaring minimum fees in OSMO.  Alternative fee assets are converted to their OSMO value, using the spot price on their primary OSMO base pair pool.  This upgrade pre-whitelists all the assets currently supported on the Osmosis frontend with an OSMO basepair pool.
- Implements [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) - Clawback of unclaimed Osmo and Ion on airdrop end date. (December 15th, 5PM UTC)
- Upgrade IBC from a standalone module in the SDK to [IBC v2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). This improves the utility of Ethereum Bridges and Cosmwasm bridges.
- Blocking [OFAC banned ETH addresses](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sanctions/1.0/sdn_advanced.xml) 
- Numerous minor bug fixes, gas fixes, and significant speedups.

See more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)

## Getting prepared for the upgrade

All nodes will require 32GB of memory. Swap can be used to achieve this, but getting nodes with 32GB RAM is _significantly_ preferred. Furthermore, NVMe SSDs significantly improve the speed of execution.

Please follow the setup instructions here for how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.x/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v5/guide.md).

Namely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you have to install cosmovisor from the SDK v0.42.9 branch) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v5.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin/`.

If you do not want to use cosmovisor due to cosmovisor reliability issues, please be prepared to upgrade at around 2:30PM UTC, December 14th if this proposal passes.

## Details of upgrade time

When the network reaches the halt height, the Osmosis blockchain will be halted. Cosmovisor if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v5.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.

The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `2383300`, anticipated to be at `Wednesday December 14th 2:30PM UTC (9:30AM EST)`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.65 seconds per block, derived from Cros-nest dashboard. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.

The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 100 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.

### Testing your upgrade setup

There is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.

"Proposal for removing OSMO incentives on JUNO / XKI pool

By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers simply signal their support for:
Removing OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool through the Semi Automatic Incentive Adjustment.

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for:
Removing OSMO incentives to XKI/JUNO pool on Osmosis.

** Details **

The following proposal is a special signaling proposal to initiate the processes needed to remove XKI/JUNO pair into the set of assets that get OSMO LP incentives.
Regular XKI/JUNO pool have gone live on Osmosis AMM and liquidity has been bootstrapped by the Ki Foundation.
A proposal for JUNO incentives that would be matched by XKI incentives has been posted and rejected by the Juno community as it happened to be more controversial than expected: https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/7.

In order to remain fair to the OSMOSIS community, the Ki Foundation offers to support the removal of OSMO incentives from the JUNO / XKI pools as it has been stated on the live with Cryptocito: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=leY7R217qss.

This proposal has for sole goal to keep a spirit of fairness towards the Osmosis community, as we will continue building products on the Juno chain and continue our support on making the Cosmos ecosystem a more interoperable space!

"Stargaze Community Loan and LBP

This proposal includes the details regarding the loan of OSMO to Stargaze’s multi-sig and the parameters of the LBP. By voting Yes on this proposal will signify approval for both a loan of OSMO to Stargaze, and Stargaze will then launch and LBP with the following parameters with that funding. 
The request for a loan of 135,000 OSMO (~$724K) from the Osmosis community treasury to a multi-sig controlled by community members. Stargaze will use this OSMO to launch a 95/5 Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) on Osmosis. 

The members of this multi-sig will include: 
- James Parillo, Figment
- Shane Vitarana, Stargaze
- Cosmostation

Based on the LBP mechanics and OSMO volumes, the starting price of STARS will be $0.28.
Stargaze will pay back the value of the original loan in STARS once the LBP has ended.
There will be a 0.3% swap fee - Osmosis and Stargaze community pools will split the rewards of this fee 50/50.

Osmosis multi-sig public address: osmo1s3unu92e8zv8mfw7n5d4vrgkj9chn7yv0sh8rw 

Stargaze multi-sig public address: stars1s3unu92e8zv8mfw7n5d4vrgkj9chn7yvnhn27d


Background:
LBPs are a way to ensure a fair distribution of tokens at launch and to discover a fair market price of the token with low capital requirements. A 95/5 pool will have 95% of STARS to 5% of OSMO value. Over a period of 3 days, the goal is for the pool to reach 50/50 value.
LBPs allow teams to build liquidity without a large amount of upfront capital. It also separates the mechanisms for distributing tokens from the token price. This will be the first community pool loan for Osmosis and Stargaze.
Liquidity pools work within the crypto space with automated market makers, providing token holders and networks with liquidity through decentralized mechanisms. Liquidity pools usually only have a 50/50 ratio, where the value of Asset A equals the value of Asset B.

Potential Risks:
If there are no purchases for STARS, the price would fall to zero as the weighting decreases and the fluctuation in weighting creates constant downward pressure on the price.

Details about the LBP:
Start Time: December 16th, 2021 19:00 UTC
End Time: December 19th, 2021

"Regen token transfer

This is a signalling proposal for the transfer of 1.399mm $REGEN to the Osmosis community.

This transfer will be to the community pool address, giving osmo holders ownership and ability to utilize these tokens through the existing osmosis governance process.

We expect this allocation to be used strategically for protocol-owned liquidity provision, use-cases exploring eco-credits, modest provision of yield farming provisions, matching grants to public goods, and open-source development funding.

We propose the main criteria for judging use-cases should be the long term strategic benefit to leveraging the Osmosis DEX in partnership with Regen Network as an originator for ecological assets that create a new Regenerative Finance asset class native to our growing IBC ecosystem.

Voting YES on this proposal signals the Osmosis community’s willingness to receive this grant, and govern it for LONG TERM strategic benefit as outlined broadly above.

"[Action Required] IBC patch upgrade at 2464000

# [Action Required] IBC patch upgrade at 2464000\
\
The v5 upgrade had a subtle bug that prevents creation of new IBC channels.\
\
No current user funds are at risk, and the bug does not affect trading, LP, bonding.\
\
All existing IBC channels function just as before, IBC deposits and withdrawals for existing assets are not affected.\
\
The bug solely prevents new channels from being created, preventing new chains from connecting to Osmosis. Bug details at the end.\
\
This proposal suggests doing an emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v6 binary. This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The [v6.0.0 software version](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v6.0.0) is fully state-compatible with `v5.0.0` until the upgrade block `2464000`, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v3 upgrade (prop 17), used when the governance deposit mechanism was broken.\
\
The proposed upgrade block height of 2464000 is estimated to be at December 20, 2021, 16:00 UTC (Monday).\
\
All validators, and full node operators should update their software to version `v6.0.0` prior to block height 2464000. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\
\
Failure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\
\
## Actionable(s)\
\
* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0`, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0.\
* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\
* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\
\
## Failure case and risks involved\
\
In the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - ""validators"" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis)\
\
Note: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\
\
## Governance procedure\
\
 A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\
 A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\
\
Deposits are intended to be used by validators here.\
\
- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key. Please do this, even if your validator operator key is behind a multisig. This is a good time to take advantage of authz, to allow easier depositing & voting.\
- Once over 66% of voting power has signalled readiness, this upgrade proposal is considered valid.\
- Should this proposal fail to gather readiness signalling from two-thirds of voting power by December 20th 4AM UTC, the upgrade proposal should be considered failed and validators should revert to the old binary prior to block 2464000.\
\
## Testing methodology\
\
This upgrade has been tested to be compatible with v5.0.0 until the upgrade height on a testnet. This was done by having a v6.0.0 validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected). The v6.0.0 node could then receive IBC transfers.\
\
## Bug Details\
\
Relevant issue: [osmosis-labs/osmosis #665](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/665)\
\
TL;DR - There was a subtle misconfiguration in the Osmosis app.go. This slipped in from a copy-paste error during the SDK 42 -> 44 upgrade. This manifested in being unable to create new channels.\

"Match External Incentives for BTSG/OSMO, BTSG/ATOM and BTSG/UST

**Background**
As established in Osmosis Proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

**Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the BitSong team for BTSG/OSMO (pool 573), BTSG/ATOM (pool 574) and BTSG/UST (pool 592). External incentives have already begun and will continue for 30 epochs.

By voting YES on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will be matched at ~$22,000 per day, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
By voting NO on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will NOT be matched at ~$22,000 per day, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG

**Context**
The BitSong team has provided the second batch of 1,500,000 BTSG across BTSG/OSMO pool 573, BTSG/ATOM pool 574 and BTSG/UST pool 592, amounting to ~$660,000, at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG, over the course of 30 epochs beginning Wednesday, December 29th at 00:00am UTC.

The $BTSG incentives are as follows:

BTSG/OSMO (Pool #573): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
BTSG/ATOM (Pool #574): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
BTSG/UST (Pool #592): ~16,666.65btsg per day amounting to ~$7.333,33 at the current value of $0,44 x BTSG
Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$22,000 per day.

As passed in Osmosis Proposal 54 https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/54, these matched incentives would be in addition to the existing incentives gained from fee subsidies.",0.0225995787241479
"Increase Max Validator Set Size to 118

This proposal attempts to increase the MaxValidators parameter from 100 to 118. Please read the thread created in the forum for more details: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/2958-proposal-increase-max-validator-set-size-to-118",0.20201097848003421
"Fix IBC transfers between Lum Network and Osmosis

Follow-up on proposal #111 which was rejected on purpose, read the details below for more information.

**Proposal goal:**

This proposal will enable the unfreezing process of the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network, thus allowing deposits and withdrawals of **$LUM** on the Osmosis platform:

- By voting **YES**, OSMO stakers voice their support in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network
- By voting **NO**, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network

This proposal has no effect beside enabling back the IBC connection between the two chains.

**Details:**

The IBC connection between Osmosis and the Lum Network was shutdown during the **$LUM** Liquidity Bootstrapping Phase in order to have a proper price discovery without external interferences.

Shutting down the IBC connection froze the currently use channel (3-115). Meaning that no IBC transfer can be made using this channel unless this governance proposal is voted **YES** by OSMO stakers.

The process to enable IBC transfers back require to substitute the current IBC client by a new one that is not in an expired state.

This proposal is a follow-up on the proposal #111 which was rejected on purpose since it raised technical concerns.
Indeed, this process had not been tested properly in production prior to proposal #111 and Lum team along Osmosis team agreed to provide a better testing background prior to asking everyone to vote YES to this proposal.

Tests have now been performed succesfully and we are confident this proposal will not have undesired side effects!
The following repository contains a full test suite representing what will happen once this proposal is voted YES: https://github.com/lum-network/ibc-testbed

The Lum Team also wrote a mega-thread on Twitter detailing everything that happened since its main-net launch in order to give more colour to the discussion and debate around this IBC issue: https://twitter.com/lum_network/status/1475261081333477378",0.0017316098788465368

"Signaling Proposal: Ion🧿 DAO & Treasury

****Full Commonwealth Discussion Thread**** : https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposal/discussion/3100-ion-dao-and-treasury

At the moment, an ION Dao does not yet exist, as there is no code for this mechanism. However, with the passing of Proposal 107, Osmosis will soon be integrating the CosmWasm smart contracting system. Once this exists, an ION Dao can be created via CosmWasm smart contract. The exact governance mechanism and design to be used for the ION Dao is yet to be seen, but this proposal signals that Osmosis governance pre-commits to transferring the clawed back 16572 IONs to such an ION Dao once it exists and the transfer can be safely executed.

-- Vote YES on this proposal if you are in favor of the creation of an ION Dao and the eventual transfer of 16572 ION from the Osmosis Community Pool to the ION Dao's Treasury

This is a signaling proposal to include DSM pairs, [ATOM/DSM (#618)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/618) and [DSM/OSMO (#619)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/619), into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. Both of these pools have been live since 13 January 2022 (UTC).

A total of 5,000,000 DSM external incentive, which are worth of .9million as of this writing, have become effective on 15 Jan 2022.

After this proposal has passed, the above DSM pools will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

"Match External Incentives for HUAHUA/OSMO and HUAHUA/ATOM pairs

As established in Osmosis proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.

By voting YES you agree to match external HUAHUA incentives provided by Chihuahua Incentives will be matched with OSMO at this rate:
HUAHUA/OSMO (pool 605) ~16,666,666 HUAHUA per day corresponding to ~$130,000 per day based on the current price
HUAHUA/ATOM (pool 606) ~16,666,666 HUAHUA per day corresponding to ~$130,000 per day based on the current price

"Increase External Matched Incentives cap to 30%

Proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) enabled the matching of External Incentives with the dollar value in Osmo as an incentive for external providers to provide liquidity rewards from their own token reserve.
Within Proposal 47, a cap of 20% of the daily inflation intended for liquidity incentives was established to restrict the matching program in the early phases of the Osmosis decentralised exchange.
The most recent Semi-Automatic Incentive Adjustment proposal (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/124) used 19.182% of daily Osmo LP incentives to match all current external incentives to a value of ~,017,421 per day.
With Proposal 126 for HUAHUA external incentives looking to pass, continued full matching of external incentives is currently projected to require 26.15% of incentives to be used
To allow for full matching to continue and to allow capacity for potential further external incentives to be matched I propose that the cap be raised to 30%
This proposal is based on discussion here: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3292-external-incentive-reevaluation and here: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3439-proposal-increase-external-matched-incentives-cap-to-30 

Voting YES for this proposal indicates that 30% of daily OSMO inflation intended for liquidity incentives may be used to match External Incentives

Voting NO for this proposal indicates that External Incentive matching will be scaled down so that the total matching does not exceed 20% of daily OSMO inflation intended for liquidity incentives.",0.04934996186163754
"Add a bias factor to external incentive matching

If another project allocates incentives to a non-osmo pool, Osmosis right now matches its incentives equally to how it matches non-osmo pools. This comes at a cost to all of the 'main' swap-fee driven pool incentives. (As this is osmo rewards they are not getting!)

This proposal proposes that external incentive matching maintain the same bias factor that is used for all incentivized pools within Osmosis. If the bias factor system (or equivalent preferential treatment for certain base asset) changes as time goes on, the external incentive matching should adapt in the same fashion.

Right now proposal 127 feels ill-advised without this type of mechanism in place, as it is increasing the % of osmo incentives being allocated for incentive matching, without improving upon any of the core problems currently present in the external matching system. Right now, it is bad that there is no accounting for bias factors, thus over-paying for non-osmo base pair pools, and it is bad that a few high external incentive pools take the entire matching pot. There should instead be per-asset / per-pool caps, as there is 0 obligation for 1-1 matching as the ratio. It is also significant that prop 127 a significant 50% increase, without much discussion, put up in haste. And without the community being very clear that its going to lower APYs to every other pool, e.g. osmo/atom, osmo/ust, osmo/luna, with the difference being giving atom/huahua 300% instead of 210% osmo APY. In defense of proposal 127, this was done, due to the 20% cap for external incentive matching being made without a clear guideline for how it'll be enforced being agreed upon. (As it was not specified in prop 47)

As a response, this proposal is also put up in haste, to try to fix some of the core problems in a way that the commonwealth, Osmosis discord, and Osmosis siberia comunities have already expressed agreement in. Namely, make external incentive matching follow the same bias factor present in Osmosis. This concretely means that the Osmo-side bonus APY for external incentive ATOM pools will halve. However, the swap fee APY, swap-fee induced osmo APY, plus the actual external incentive APY will remain as before. This a better allocation for incentives that governance has already agreed upon, and it was inconsistent that this was not already being done for external incentive matching.",0.008067811575541558

About Dig:
Dig will bring real estate onto the blockchain in a way no one has ever done before. At its core, Dig addresses the regulatory roadblocks standing between real estate and the blockchain. Dig will achieve this through a network of jurisdictionally compartmentalized blockchains that fund real estate development in local markets, for example: Dig Vietnam / Dig UK / Dig Belarus. All of these sub-chains will all operate under Dig, each one able to comply with local regulations. Dig shall develop an NFT standard that allows for the fractional ownership of digital or physical items and have a high-touch local team in every relevant market to this end. In short, Dig will comply with local regulations in each country it operates within, allowing it to gradually expand as the regulatory framework of each country develops.

Onboarding for DSM pools
Match external incentives to HUAHUA pools
Matching soft cap of 20% has been reached, so all matches are only matching at a reduced rate of 76%
After consultation with community members, the decision was made to not pipeline any of proposals 127,128,129, or 130 into this proposal, as discussions around matching are ongoing, and 128 was deemed to be ambiguous, as the letter of the law interpretation (osmo 1.5x, non-osmo 0.5x) is inconsistent with what the proposer intended (osmo 1x, non-osmo 0.5x)
This should be resolved before the next adjustment via a more complete matching proposal

"Incentive Matching Fee Based and 1:1 Caps

Voting YES for this proposal indicates that matching external incentives will no more than double the standard OSMO incentives for a pool and not be matched more than 1:1 in dollar value.

 Voting NO for this proposal indicates that external incentives will continue to be over-matched according to the external incentive dollar value provided according the bias established in proposal 128 and only capped by the 30% global cap established in proposal 127. 

 This proposal asks two questions of Osmosis governance and was combined as they are linked.
 The external incentive program established in Proposal 47 has resulted in huge amounts of external tokens being distributed to Osmosis Liquidity Providers as rewards. However, the recent external incentives for STARS, HUAHUA and CMDX, as well as the proposed external ROWAN incentives in #132, have been substantially higher than previous ones. Matching these has resulted in a large amount of the daily Osmosis incentive distribution being used for matching purposes and has had proportionately reduced the APR across other pools without matching incentives.
 A bias to external incentives has been confirmed in Proposal 128. This is not a simple weighting to provide non-Osmosis incentives 50% of the rewards that Osmosis pools do. Instead the weight of non-OSMO pools is decreased by 50% as well as the weight of OSMO pools being raised by 50%.
 As a result of this, on the next semi-automatic incentives proposal, each  of external incentives on non-OSMO pools will not only be matched by bash.50 in OSMO rewards, but would also result in OSMO pools being matched by .50. (In both instances up to the 30% overall cap coming into effect). 

 This proposal requests that the maximum match for  in external incentives is  in OSMO. 

 These external incentives have also generated a lot of hype around high APRs, partially funded by Osmosis matching these high external incentives on new pools. This may have caused price increases of these tokens as liquidity providers seek to buy in to pools with higher APRs. In turn causing the price to further increase and therefore requiring even more OSMO to match the, now higher, dollar value of external incentives.
 In order to ensure that the OSMO spent on matching these external incentives is useful for the ecosystem, this proposal requests that a cap on the dollar value of OSMO used for matching be added based on the fees generated by the pool. Fees generated give an indicator of how actively a pool is used and the value that the additional liquidity attracted by this external matching will bring to Osmosis. This cap would be based on the Subsidy Bias model that is in use for normal incentives, promoting the addition of external incentives on OSMO pools and reducing Osmosis' spend on other pools. I.E.  of fees generated in OSMO pools would allow, currently, 3x the dollar amount of OSMO to be available to meet external matching up to the other caps compared to  of fees in a non-OSMO pool.

 In short this limits the bonus OSMO APR provided by the incentive matching program to the non-matched APR. 

  Whichever of these caps is hit first would be the maximum dollar amount of OSMO that Osmosis uses to match incentives.

"Use Dual-AMM design for incentivized stable coin pools?

This proposal is to specifically to determine if the Zone approves of implementing the Dual-AMM design concept as the _ONLY_ UST pool structures that should get LP incentivization, with the hope that if it preforms as desired it can be the template for any future stable coins.

Amount & method of calculating LP rewards allocated to these pools should be addressed in a separate standalone proposal if it is to differ from the currently agreed upon onboarding algorithm passed under Prop#13.

The genesis thesis behind this proposal was...to get people thinking about how Osmosis can accomplish much more than is currently possible. We can help spread awareness that Osmosis can build weighted AMMs and pools with more than just two tokens. I also think we can make the pools more efficient...With 2 pools of OSMO/UST, I can shift my position based on how bearish, neutral, or bullish I am on OSMO, by moving liquidity between the low OSMO/high UST and the high OSMO/low UST pools.


**************** READ FULL EXPLANATION OF THE DUAL-AMM CONCEPT ON THE COMMONWEALTH FORUM ****************

https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/1690-dualamm-structure-incentivized-ust-pools-and-ion-usecase

*********************************************************************************************************

Cliff Notes, TLDR : 

1) Position OSMO as the default medium of exchange on the AMM (base pair value)

2) Display Osmosis AMM flexibility of weighted and >2 token pools (80/20 & tri-asset pool)

3) Promote a healthy concentration of liquidity at low swap fee (pool efficiency)

4) Reduction of Divergence Loss (a.k.a Impermanent Loss)

5) Highlight the zone's other Native token which already generates much curiosity & intrigue on social networks. (What is ION?)


If passed, the ONLY UST based pools that should get LP incentives will be the ones with this following configuration.  

Pool #1 - 80% OSMO  20% UST   5% ION
Pool #2 - 80% UST   20% OSMO  5% ION

"Incentivising UST and Luna on Osmosis exposes the ecosystem and stakeholders to significant regulatory and stability risk

Incentivising UST and Luna on Osmosis exposes the ecosystem and stakeholders to significant regulatory and stability risk.

In many ways UST is similar to Stripper Dollars:

1. UST adoption has to a large extent been driven by shady activities and circumvention of regulation. This includes enticing the wider public to trade regulated products without any consumer protection (Mirror Protocol) and luring savers with high returns without explaining the risk of losing the principal (Anchor Protocol) when/if UST collapses.
2. Like Stripper Dollars, UST provides no clear benefits compared to ""the real deal"", i.e. a USD backed stablecoin. Only Luna holders benefit from the minting of UST.
3. Stripper Dollars have a tendency to become worthless overnight. Algorithmic stablecoins have a similar track record.

Is UST really the best USD stablecoin for Osmosis? It seems like we could easily do better by adopting an existing USD backed stablecoin such as USDC.

When evaluating the commentary and voting on this proposal, keep in mind that key figures from in the Cosmos ecosystem are heavily invested in Luna and thus have strong economic incentive to see UST and Luna integrated in Osmosis, regardless of risk and long term consequences to the ecosystem.

Voting *YES* on this proposal signal that we, as the broader community,

1. Desire a more robust, better regulated and more transparent USD stablecoin for Osmosis, that is future proof. This could be USDC bridged from Ethereum or a similar mechanism.
2. Reject offering OSMO incentives for Luna and UST pools as it exposes the Osmosis community to regulatory risk from (at least) the SEC. If this proposal passes, it minimises the gauge settings from proposal #52 ""Add Incentives to Osmo/Ust and Osmo/Luna"".


Background:

Regulatory Risk:
Mr. Do Kwon is currently engaging in fisticuffs with SEC lawyers regarding the specifics of how (and if) he was served during Mainnet 2021. This seems like a feeble attempt to distract from what is really the larger play regarding UST and Luna.
https://www.scribd.com/document/534537134/Terraform-v-SEC

Even if the SEC is unsuccessful in shutting down Terraform Labs and it's services in South Korea, they can certainly persue U.S. entities offering trading and staking services around UST and Luna.

Offering incentives in the form of OSMO incentives for Luna and UST on Osmosis exposes the wider community (including validators) to this same level of scrutiny. If this is a concern for you, vote *YES* on this proposal.


Stability Risk:
Algorithmic stablecoins have historically imploded spectacularly once their supply decreases and they enter a death spiral.

This is also a likely outcome for Terra stablecoins and it might be an understatement to claim Terraform Labs are scrambling to sustain growth: An additional 3-4 billion UST is about to be minted.

Furthermore, it is the only blockchain-based, GPU enhanced graph database in the world.  What cyber lacks in practicality, it makes up for tenfold in the team's realisitic assessment of the current state of human affairs, and offers some novel solutions for that.  Furthermore, cyber is at present capable of acting as a type of chain-linked storage system, for any front end application in Cosmos.  It is our opinion at Notional that cyber's concepts warrant a very serious look.  List: 
 * GPU Accelerated Graph Database 
 * Novel, branded, and tightly integrated block explorer

TLDR -- Send all unclaimed ION & OSMO to OSMO stakers. 


Distribute clawback ION to all OSMO stakers proportionally to OSMO staked. This will realign IONs value position with new OSMO holders who may have not been around for the genesis distribution but have since bought OSMO and staked.


Distribute clawback OSMO to all OSMO stakers who have voted on at least 3 governance proposals. This will ensure no lazy voters are rewarded while also rewarding those who were at least semi active in governance. 


These actions will further cement the value proposition behind OSMO staking and securing of the chain, building the future expectation of value when staking.

The following proposal is a signaling proposal to include the ROWAN:OSMO and ROWAN:ETH pairs into the set of assets that get regular OSMO LP incentives and to match the external ROWAN incentives provided by Sifchain (detailed below).

Note: the ETH pool specified within this proposal is the ROWAN:ETH pool which will contain the pegged ETH from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge.

ROWAN:OSMO and ROWAN:ETH pools will go live on Osmosis AMM shortly after Sifchain’s upcoming MAGNOLIA upgrade.

**External incentive details:**

Sifchain’s external incentive program will allocate a total of 40 million ROWAN in external rewards to the two pools over a span of 30 epochs. It will begin after the upcoming deployment of Sifchain’s MAGNOLIA upgrade which will enable IBCv2 transfers.

ROWAN:OSMO: ~375K ROWAN per epoch
ROWAN:ETH: ~958K ROWAN per epoch.

Once the signal proposal is passed, the pools will be added to the regular OSMO incentive and OSMO matched external incentive update proposal through the onboarding process.

"Development and Marketing Expansion to the Russian Community

By voting YES on this proposal, the community agrees to allocate 7500 OSMO for developmental and marketing expansion to the Russian-speaking crypto space.
 By voting NO on this proposal, the community dissents on allocating 7500 OSMOS for developmental and marketing expansion to the Russian-speaking crypto space.

 The IBC Gang and Osmosis are almost completely unknown in the Russian-speaking crypto community. We propose to facilitate an expansion of Osmosis into the Russian-speaking crypto space, through marketing access to forklog.com, facilitating Russian-language content and providing developer support.
Summary of the proposal: ForkLog is the biggest Russian-language crypto magazine, working since 2014. Our website reports on everything in crypto and attracts about 1M readers monthly with over 6M monthly page views. With the funding we will do a series of articles and videos on Osmosis on Forklog.com. A more detailed overview of the exact services can be found in the attached full proposal.
The second part of the proposal is aimed at increasing the outreach to Russian-language developers. It includes a complete translation of the technical documentation of Osmosis (Gitbook, Docbook) into Russian and the establishment of Russian-language developer support on Discord from our developer James.

"Signaling proposal: Match external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ pool

Signaling proposal to incentivise ATOM:CHEQ pool 617.
 - By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/617 
 - By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to adding OSMO incentives to https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/617. 

 This is a signalling proposal to include the ATOM:CHEQ pair into the set of assets which receive OSMO liquidity incentives, which has been requested by the CHEQ community who are eager to provide liquidity.
 The benefit to the Osmosis community from cheqd.io is pretty clear: The team are experts in digital identity, specifically self-sovereign identity (SSI) where the individual holds their own data, following the ""Hold your own keys"" mantra. In a short span of time, they have established partnerships with some of the largest SSI software vendors in the world. They want to bring identity to the IBC stack in a way that preserves user privacy and bring Cosmos to the SSI community. Currently, there are CHEQ external incentives on CHEQ:OSMO (pool #602) which are matched with OSMO incentives; as well as CHEQ external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ (pool #617).

"Allocate 125k Osmo from the OCP to give Support/Marketing access to guidance on business matters related to Defi, DAOs, and structuring.

This proposal is to allocate 125k OSMO to a multi-sig wallet controlled by members of the Osmosis Support Lab and Osmosis Ministry of Marketing.  The wallet will then delegate all funding to Redline validation in exchange for consulting services related to Defi, DAOs,and structuring.  This delegation will hold for a minimum of 6 months.  At the end of 6 months the two working groups will assess if we need to increase, decrease or undelegate funding.  Any funds not used for delegations to Redline will be sent directly back to the community pool.  When services are no longer needed or wanted, this funding will return directly back to the community pool.  This is a no loss scenario for the community pool, as the requested funds will never be spent or leave the multi-sig wallet except to be returned to the community pool. 

 The members of the OSL and OMM have vetted Redline and its services and their current engagements with many reputable teams and projects. At a high level Redline will be providing key services and recommendations to reduce major bottlenecks related to structuring recommendations, support, and logistical help. In fact they have already completed bodies of work. Given our previous unsuccessful efforts to solicit these services from various other vendors, Redline has already delivered better than expected results in a timely manner 

 This approach will be the first example of community funded consultation for community funded initiatives.  The delegation will ensure the two groups can confidently engage with adequate consulting teams necessary for them to have maximum impact with the funding allocated to them.  This service can be used by other working groups in Osmosis and is not exclusive to Support and Marketing.  We advise all teams and users to engage with Redline before committing any delegations as they will be a 100% validator 

 About Redline: 
 “Redline specializes in consulting services and helps crypto teams, foundations, and DAOs navigate through the unique hurdles presented to crypto and DeFi.  Our unique model provides access to top-tier talent without any out-of-pocket costs or traditional bottlenecks.   We are quick to execute an engagement, are fully transparent, and are tailored for the dynamic crypto environment.”

"Remove incentives from all xki pools

xki has some kind of system or user that trades once per minute or so, at fixed intervals, using the same amount of dollar denominated value.   The motive for this is likely the reality that osmosis currently incentivizes pools based on trading volume.  The automated system or tireless human is responsible for nearly all xki trading.

This activity has been entirely clear, and unless it suddenly stops, can be seen here:

https://info.osmosis.zone/token/XKI

XKI is being wash traded from at least two addresses, at a rate of around $1000 per minute:

https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo1tzut4xfjnnue7pjh54s5x07dkgh3kqwu8llpg3

https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo1c2xdjyysa4rrlk865nm5dm3rfjw4dcdlxd756g

As of the time of this gov prop this activity was occurring in real time, and if the activity were to cease, it is able to be viewed historically as well at those addresses and in the histories of the affected pools.

Vote YES on this proposal if you support that osmosis stop incentivizing XKI as soon as possible, reducing incentives funded by osmo inflation on XKI pools to zero.

Vote NO on this proposal if you would like for osmosis inflation to continue to be used to incentivize XKI liquidity providers.

Vote NOWITHVETO on this proposal if you'd like Notional to experience a 500 osmo financial penalty for making this proposal.

"Allocate a flat portion of staking rewards per validator

Voting YES for this proposal indicates:
Support for the addition of a flat staking reward for validators, causing a higher APR for lower ranked validators to promote decentralization.
Support for reallocating the required  for this flat staking reward from the overall pot of daily staking rewards.

Voting NO for this proposal indicates: 
No support for adding a flat staking reward for validators

Decentralization of a blockchain validation network is important to ensure that no one party or small group has excessive influence over the security of the chain and governance decisions.
In order to improve decentralization of Osmosis, a system of biasing staking rewards towards delegation to validators with less share of the vote may be effective.
This proposal asks that a fraction of the daily staking inflation be reallocated to provide an incentive of 20  to all validators at or above the midpoint of the validator set, and a proportional incentive below this rank to maintain the increased APR of the validator at the midpoint.

"Onboard HOPE/OSMO #653 for Osmosis Incentives

Proposal details

- By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to HOPE-OSMO liquidity pool 653 on Osmosis.

- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to HOPE-OSMO liquidity pool 653 on Osmosis.

Details
After this proposal has passed governance, the HOPE/OSMO pool #653 will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO, begin the onboarding process, and bring HOPE back to the main app.

In the meantime,
The Hope community Dao has approved a governance proposal on DaoDao to allocate 1000 HOPE (6,18% of the total supply) to be used as external liquidity rewards on the HOPE/OSMO pool #653. 

These are the characteristics of the gauge we will create:
-pool #653 HOPE/OSMO
-1 external incentive
-1000 HOPE 
-14 days bonding
-duration 180 epochs

Reasoning as to why it's just a 1 gauge: HOPE is a long-term project, and is really only interested in attracting long-term liquidity providers.


About Hope Galaxy project:

The HOPE Token, in addition could be burnt in order to claim an exclusive Hope Galaxy NFT. 

The Hope Galaxy NFT collection will consist of 4 collections “Galaxies”, 2000 NFTs each with its own unique traits and stories, and 1 “starship” Collection of 180 NFTs.

HOPE Token has a fixed supply, the scarcity of the token will increase with the minting of each subsequent Galaxy, as individuals are required to destroy (“burn”) a token in order to receive a Hope Galaxy NFT.

All Hope Galaxy NFTs are made for metaverse and gaming applications, with the aim of producing benefits for the owners.

* Voting NO for this proposal indicates that the voting period for Osmosis proposals will remain at 5 days. 

 This proposal asks for a reduction of the Voting Period from 5 days to 2 days due to Osmosis needing to respond rapidly to the ongoing Terra depeg event, Osmosis incentive restructuring and a rapidly changing environment.
This reduction to the Voting Period will be temporary. A follow-up governance proposal will be posted no later then 1st July 2022 to revert the Voting Period back to 5 days, implement a variable voting period for proposal types or request an extension to this emergency Voting Period.
 During this period governance should be vigilant to any proposals as the time for discussion is very limited.

* BCNA
* HUAHUA
* UMEE
* DSM
* LIKE

In addition, OSMO incentives for ALL pairs will be removed from the following assets:

* MNTL
* SWTH
* DIG

The goals of this proposal are two-fold: first is to remove incentives from the aforementioned pools, freeing up incentives to add to assets that will bring value to OSMO stakers, holders, and LPers. Second, to ignite discussion about the process of awarding incentives in the first place. Notably, these incentives were instituted with minimal to no vetting, by simple goverance vote.

## Context

In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%

"Match external ECH incentives on ECH/OSMO (#747)

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in matching ECH incentives on ECH/OSMO (#747)
* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in matching external ECH incentives on ECH/OSMO (#747)

## Details
This is a signaling proposal to match external ECH incentives on ECH/OSMO (#747) as per the matching program guidelines established in Osmosis proposals 47, 128 and 133.

Incentives match from Osmosis governance are required to have Echelon (ECH) listed as an asset in the main dapp at app.osmosis.zone (reference PR #212 on the Osmosis assetlist), which also is required for listing the market under the Echelon Coinmarketcap listing. Echelon brings together more than seven blockchains, bringing traffic and new user exposure to Osmosis.

Echelon external incentives are live on pool ECH/OSMO #747 to the value of 10,000,000 ECH over a 180 day period, totaling an average value of ~$100,000 USD or $550 USD (~55,000 ECH) per day.
Echelon external incentives are live on pool ECH/USDC #748 to the value of 2,000,000 ECH over a 90 day period, totaling an average value of ~$20,000 USD or $222 USD (~22,000 ECH) per day.

There will be future proposals onchain with ECH to use community pool funding for further incentives, past the end dates of the current live pools.

## About Echelon
Echelon is a public Cosmos and EVM compatible blockchain protocol and new ecosystem that bridges DeFi and mass adoption. The Echelon consensus and layer protocols delivers unparalleled speed, scalability, and security. Echelon equally serves as an application-agnostic chain fully interoperable with the Ethereum mainnet, all EVM compatible environments, and other chains via Cosmos IBC. Expectedly, it eases cross-chain transferals of value for both developers and end-users. Echelon also features a custom bridge across six popular EVM blockchains for free (just gas).

"Remove blocked.go from Osmosis

# Proposal

 This proposal aims to come to consensus that we should delete the blocked.go file in the Osmosis Github Repository (https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/app/blocked.go). My name is Anthony Rosa, and I am the project lead at Moultrie Audits. Centralized entities like Tether are holding firm to protect censorship resistance (https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1562468486886346753?s=20&t=R3Gc5J6rUnSfOzeYxNZyuw). There are many aspects to this conversation, and it is encouraged to read through the associated commonwealth threads (linked below) prior to voting. The blocked.go file prevents users from withdrawing to the contained blocked addresses, and the file comments state “we block all OFAC-blocked ETH addresses from receiving tokens.” If we accept as a community that we should censor addresses the government deems illegitimate, our entire purpose becomes questionable.

 # Reasons To Delete blocked.go

Why have a blockchain if the service retains the censorship restrictions of Web2? How can we claim to be decentralized while preventing users from accessing a service through a central repository subject to revision by the government? Why wouldn’t this set a censorship precedent? Are we here to make money or change the world? 

It is my opinion that it’s better if we fail trying to democratize finance with a truly decentralized DEX than succeed as a TradFi proxy, touting disingenuous values. In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated, “If we do nothing about it now, you will see a slow but steady erosion of your right to trade freely...We need to come together and support our freedom to trade crypto in the spirit with which most of it has been developed – permissionlessly.”

# Counterarguments

There are severe possible consequences for not complying with OFAC or any other government requirement to block specific addresses. Removing the functionality to block addresses at a protocol level opens up financial and legal risk to infrastructure providers, developers, users, investors, and the entire Osmosis community. Validator level censorship is still a possibility, but an additional burden.

 In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated “I don't think this is morally the right direction, by the US government, or by implementing these policies. However, I do think logically it is the best step forward to preserve and protect our validators.” 

# Vote Explanation

Yes: Developers should move to remove the blocked.go file from the Osmosis repo. We’ll start by deleting the addresses in the file.
 No: We should keep the blocked.go file and associated functionality.
No With Veto: You believe this proposal is spam or malicious to Osmosis and we should keep the blocked.go file and associated functionality. Moultrie Audits will lose the deposit.

"[ION DAO] Initialize

## Summary
The ION DAO has successfully gone through testnet and is now ready to launch onto the Osmosis mainnet.

Vote **YES** on this proposal if you want to instantiate ION DAO contract on Osmosis.  
Vote **NO** on this proposal if you do not want to.  

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.  

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).  

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig  

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.  

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features 
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee 
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list 
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal 
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

"Community consent Cosmos Pay supporting OSMO

# **TL:DR:**
BitCanna has released a payment plugin for the Cosmos-ecosystem for WooCommerce and Prestashop.
In this plugin OSMO is enabled as payment method, offering a possibility for webshops to start accepting OSMO as a means of payment. Community support is vital in our opinion, which is why we want to ask the approval of the Osmosis community to have OSMO enabled in the plugin with this proposal. Besides that, having proposal [#376](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/376) in the back of our minds we are requesting to keep the BCNA/OSMO pool incentivized and listed on the main page of Osmosis.
* Vote Yes if you are in favor of having OSMO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay and in favor of keeping the pool BCNA/OSMO (#571) incentivized in the OSMO/MINOR category
* Vote No if you don’t want OSMO as a payment method in Cosmos Pay and/or against keeping the pool BCNA/OSMO (#571) incentivized in the OSMO/MINOR category
## Details
### Who is BitCanna?
BitCanna has been found by and for the cannabis industry. It aims to provide a secure and efficient way for businesses and consumers to transact using blockchain technology to create a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions, enabling fast and secure payments without the need for intermediaries. The platform also includes a range of tools and services for merchants, such as point-of-sale systems and financial management tools. With BitCanna, the cannabis industry can benefit from the advantages of digital currencies, including low transaction fees, global accessibility, and increased security.

Website: [https://www.bitcanna.io](https://www.bitcanna.io)

### What is Cosmos Pay?
Cosmos Pay is an open-source plugin developed by BitCanna for the e-commerce. Currently it is live for the platforms WooCommerce and Prestashop. Keplr is integrated, making the user experience to pay as smooth as possible.
The plugin offers the possibility to integrate a lot (if not all) Cosmos-SDK based cryptocurrencies and is therefore an addition to the tools the Cosmos ecosystem already has to offer. In the current setup ATOM, OSMO, JUNO and BCNA are supported; with more to come in the (near) future. Find out more [here](https://commerce.bitcanna.io).

### Why this proposal?
Support from the community is one of the greatest perks in the Cosmos-ecosystem. Via this route we want to give the Osmosis community a chance to have their say in this and to have a method to express their support of the Osmosis community to have OSMO enabled as a coin in the Cosmos Pay plugin. Similar proposals will be uploaded to the Juno and Cosmos communities to get their support as well.

Also in combination with proposal [#376](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/376) having passed we would like to request the Osmosis community to keep incentives from the OSMO/MINOR category on the BCNA/OSMO pool [#571](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/571).

"Signalling Proposal for LIKE/OSMO External Incentive Match Renewal

This is a signalling proposal to match external incentives for Pool 553 - OSMO/ LIKE. This pool is currently externally incentivized with 15,000,000 LIKE for 164 days. The broader LikeCoin members recently passed a [community pool spend proposal](https://www.mintscan.io/likecoin/proposals/63) to renew pool incentives on Osmosis, focusing on the LIKE incentivize for Pool 553 - LIKE/OSMO pair.

About LikeCoin

LikeCoin is one of the earliest app-chain built on Cosmos in 2019 and recently joined hands with fellow Asia Cosmos builders to launch Cosmos Hong Kong Accelerator to bootstrap Cosmos presence in the region.

LikeCoin is active in HactAtoms events, contributing to the Osmosis ecosystem as a validator, and often ranked the top IBC project by developer activity.

LikeCoin is actively educating and bringing new audiences and use cases to Cosmos, and has been onboarding layer users via its applications. There are over 100k Cosmos addresses in the network, 32k creators, and over 2mil content registered on the LikeCoin chain, including tier-1 media like [RollingStone](https://investigation.rollingstone.com/dj-photo-war-crimes-bosnia/)

What is LikeCoin?

LikeCoin is a decentralized publishing infrastructure to create, store, publish and validate text-based content. It’s like a Web3 library system. 

LikeCoin aims to democratize publishing services to ensure everyone can access affordable, transparent, and efficient publishing services. The infrastructure aims to create and maintain the authenticity and integrity of a piece of content on the internet. It also offers a network where content is published with a proper metadata layer.

Writers, publishers, and media can explore creative business models and retain fan base more meaningfully, such as Writing NFT and NFT books. Users are on board via applications such as Liker Land [The Web3 Bookstore](https://liker.land),Liker Social [micro-blogging platform](https://liker.social/), Web3Press [WordPress plugin](https://w3press.io/).

What is LIKE?

LIKE as a token to register metadata to the LikeCoin chain, store content on IPFS & Arweave with the LikeCoin WordPress plugin, API, and web portal. 

LIKE is also the native token of applications such as Liker Land and Liker Social. It is used by writers, publishers and readers to mint/ collect Writing NFT, and NFT books.

LIKE is also a reward token available for sites to monetize their content.

"Signaling Proposal for use of ProtoRev Funds

This proposal intends to be a signaling proposal for use of ProtoRev Funds.  Currently, revenue generated from ProtoRev accumulates and sits in a pool untouched and does not benefit the platform.

The accumulated total in the pool is currently made up of the following: ~61,600 OSMO, ~1,200 ATOM, ~2,900 USDC.

See mintscan: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo17qdmjdumw4xawam4g46gtwzle5rd4zwyfqvvza

This signaling proposal would use the ProtoRev in 2 ways.

1 - OSMO accumulated in the module would be issued to stakers as daily rewards.

2 - All other assets (Atom and USDC to date) would be used to purchase OSMO on a daily basis, and burn the OSMO.


### Why?

As we think about current incentives, we have to think about what we are already incentivizing and what we are not incentivizing.

LPers: Earn Swap Fees + Inflation Rewards.  

Stakers: Earn transaction fees + Inflation Rewards

Contributors:  Earn a lot through Community Pool and Grants Program

Holders: No direct incentive other than speculation around supply shock and potential growth

I would argue that LPers and Contributors are over incentivized, and the community pool is quite large that it is overfunded as well.  Holders are probably the least funded user group in the current structure.  

I would agree that buying back and burn is minimal at this time, however it is providing a sustainable incentive path for holders, and could create positive feedback loops.

At the same time burning OSMO in the ProtoRev pool does little good as it is out of circulation anyway.  The next best option is to issue the OSMO to those most likely to invest in OSMO token itself to incentivize that behavior more.  Therefore, we will issue the OSMO to stakers. 


#### Next Steps?

This is only a signaling proposal.  If it were to pass, more work would need to be done to chose best method of implementing this plan.  This is simply to obtain communities approval to work on such a plan.

"Alternative Signalling Proposal for use of ProtoRev Funds

This proposal causes 100% of the value gained by ProtoRev to be used to initiate a deflationary burn mechanism while retaining the non-OSMO tokens earned to diversify the community pool. 

* OSMO obtained by Osmosis through the ProtoRev module will be burned. 
* Non-OSMO tokens obtained by Osmosis through the ProtoRev module will be sent to the Community Pool for later use and an equivalent value of OSMO from the Community Pool burned. 

## Details
OSMO obtained via ProtoRev is effectively burned as long as it does not re-enter circulation. There is however the potential to enter circulating supply and so is not a true deflationary model as the maximum supply remains at 1 billion. 

In order to create this burn, Proposal 516 asked that the non-OSMO assets used by the protocol be used to purchase and burn OSMO. While this gives a beneficial effect on supply, it is only around a quarter of the revenue collected through the ProtoRev module at the expense of assets that Osmosis currently has no other method of obtaining without arranging a token swap or purchase through intermediary multisigs. 

Non-OSMO tokens have greater flexibility in usage, being able to earn further yield or replace requirements for rental through protocol liquidity or perform community spending without the inflation concerns of using the native token. Therefore it would be best for Osmosis to retain these tokens in the community pool. 

As the community pool gains these tokens it no longer requires as many OSMO tokens and so it is an appropriate gesture to burn the corresponding value in OSMO. This burn rate may offset or eventually surpass the replenishment of the Community Pool by inflation and so should be pausable by governance to ensure that a software upgrade is not required to prevent excessive burns of the OSMO in the community pool. 

Burning the OSMO remaining in the ProtoRev wallet confirms that it will not re-enter circulation and establishes a deflationary mechanism for Osmosis. This will likely take a long time to become net deflationary, relying both on the thirdening of Osmosis inflation and increased levels of ProtoRev generated, but will grow in efficacy as the network matures.

"Signaling Proposal: Change LP Subsidy Factor and Max Base APR Factor in the Sif's Ascension Spreadsheet

**Summary**
We propose changing the LP subsidy factor for 'Choice Pools' and 'New Pools' from 1.35x to 1.5x starting from week 2 of Ascension and change 'Max base APR factor' to 0.84x from 0.75x to incorporate the above change for all the pools in the Sif’s Ascension Parameters Spreadsheet ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zQgnMYh-1hfLeK0qENIy5zAlGj6c1GGrgMnumARdcnw/edit#gid=659743634])

**Details**
With Prop 39 passing, Sifchain will be using this spreadsheet ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zQgnMYh-1hfLeK0qENIy5zAlGj6c1GGrgMnumARdcnw/edit#gid=659743634]) to determine the weekly Rowan emission and pool multipliers used to determine Sif’s Ascension rewards.

Three of the Variables which are used to determine the above are 

1. LP Subsidy Factor for Sif’s Choice Pools: This means the cap of the Pools of People APR is 1.35x Staking APR. (This is the extra bonus to incentivize strategic ‘pools of the people’)
2. LP Subsidy Factor for New Pools: This is a 1.35x Staking APR factor, meant to incentivize newly onboarded tokens and is in line with the Pool of People bonus.
3. Max Base APR Factor: We use a 0.75x factor of Staking APR for all non-bonus pools, but this number is contingent upon SifDAO’s approval that the pool should receive rewards. Currently all non-bonus pools on Sifchain will receive this incentive.

The value of the above two variables were calibrated to 1.35x and 0.75x respectively.

With the passage of prop 37, 40 million extra ROWAN were redelegated to further decentralize Sifchain. Due to this, the staking Apr dropped from 182% to 164%. Since this redelegation of 40 million Rowan was not included while calibrating the various parameters for Ascension, I would like to propose that we change the LP subsidy factor for 'Choice Pools' and 'New Pools' from 1.35x to 1.5x starting from week 2 of Ascension. Also change 'Max base Apr factor' to 0.84x from 0.75x to incorporate the above change for all the pools.

This will not change the tentative schedule of ROWAN emission at all, which is approved in prop 39. This will make it smoother for new LP users who join Sifchain as Ascension starts and doesn't cause unnecessary volatility of rewards as we build the momentum with Ascension and PMTP. 

**Voting Outcomes**
If you vote _yes_ you signal your approval to change 'Max base APR factor' to 0.84x and the LP subsidy factor for 'Choice Pools' and 'New Pools' to 1.5x in the Sif’s Ascension Spreadsheet (linked above) starting from week 2 of Ascension.

"Increase Validator Minimum Commission Rate to 5%

Increase Validator Minimum Commission Rate to 5%

The topic of a minimum commission has been recently discussed at length within the Validator channel on Discord due to the issue of the network voting power becoming increasingly top heavy.

Implementing a minimum validator commission rate of 5% would help ensure network stability by further helping decentralize the validator set by removing a race to zero incentive for delegators and validators, it also supports validator economic stability and longevity, reducing validator churn.

This proposal is to agree to a minimum validator commission of 5% that would be enforced via a future software upgrade.  This is inline with other chains in the ecosystem who have implemented a similar enforced commission minimum, such as Osmosis, Juno, and Stargaze.

By voting YES on this proposal you agree that all validators should set a commission rate no lower than 5%.

By voting NO on this proposal you agree that all validators should set their commission rate to whatever they see fit.

- Adds support for claiming the last 2 actions of the airdrop

## Hardware Requirements
- Mininum of **16GB of RAM** is required, 24GB/32GB would be the optimal
- CosmWasm only runs on Intel/AMD, ARM is not supported.
- CosmWasm depends on C bindings so the recommended approach is to build the binary on the system it is going to run on, or make sure `libwasmvm` is present in your system.

Regen Network, in partnership with Toucan and Moss.Earth has already launched a version of NCT on Polygon at a price of $10 per credit.

This proposal asks for a spend of 327,906 $STARS from the Community Pool to purchase 3,525 NCT from Regen Network to cover Stargaze's historical carbon emissions, confirming Stargaze's carbon neutrality blockchain up to October 2022.


Method

The $STARS will be transferred to a corresponding wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase NCT. This will then be retired to offset Stargaze's carbon emissions.

Any $STARS remaining due to price fluctuations below the intentional 20% buffer to mitigate any price volatility, and a potentially lower NCT cost, will be returned to the Stargaze Community Pool.

"Adjust blocks per year parameter to match block times

**Proposal Details**
The Stargaze network is producing blocks slower than the initial estimate of 5.5 seconds per block that was set at genesis. The original calculation was to mint 1B STARS over 5,737,588 blocks/year at 5.5sec/block. The current network performance is ~6.05sec/block.
This proposal is to adjust the blocks per year parameter to be in line with the 6.05sec block time.  This block time wascalculated over the last 100,000 blocks. This will equate to an approximate **10.14% increase in STARS minted per block** to help the network achieve the goal of minting 1B STARS in year 1.
This proposal has the backing of the Stargaze team.

Voting Yes = max validator parameter value changes from 110 to 120.

Additional Detail:

With the Stargaze V6 upgrade successfully and smoothly implemented, we feel the time is right to make another increase to the max validator #. This will help further decentralize the vote power and will lower the barrier of entry for new validators to join the active set.

At the time of writing this, the current minimum investment for a validator to join the active set is around $35,000 USD. After this proposal, it will immediately drop to around $1,000 USD. It is likely to then again increase from there as the new slots are pursued.",0.03207375020114004

"Increase the Stargaze active validator set from 120 to 130

This is a proposal for us to increase our active set of Stargaze validators from 120 to 130.

If this proposal passes, the active set will increase and we will welcome up to 10 additional validator operators.

*Why?*
To continue to lower the entry barrier for new Stargaze validator operators. StargazeProp36 (https://www.stargaze.zone/vote/36) had only 4% voting against (vs 90% voting yes)

*Why not?*
 Increasing the set of a Cosmos chain can cause block time increases, but Jorge has indicated that this increase should not cause performance issues: https://discord.com/channels/755548171941445642/755548171941445645/1019722347839766579. I've seen criticism relating to economic difficulty for newcomers to sustain their validator operations.

The incentive program will be 15% less than the previous, amounting to:

STARS/OSMO = 8.98M STARS = 144,927 STARS/day
ATOM/STARS = 5.99M STARS = 96,618 STARS/day

"Levana Rekt Dragons Aidrop Proposal

Objective: Engage active NFT communities on Ethereum to migrate them to Stargaze.
 Assumption 1: Cosmos is in the early stages of mega growth. Leading indicators include DYDX & other major protocols launching on Cosmos. We believe this DeFi protocol migration could also shift tens of thousands of wallets and hundreds of millions of dollars from Ethereum to the Cosmos.
  Assumption 2: There are many legitimate projects with strong communities on Ethereum. Due to the nature of Ethereum, these communities are not receiving the engagement they deserve. We believe that by migrating these communities to a 'smaller pond' they will see an uptick in community growth, volume, and ongoing traction.
  Engage Ethereum Communities: Stargaze wants to be proactive versus reactive by beginning to engage active NFT communities on Ethereum.
 Proof of concept: Stargaze aims to demonstrate that the concept of airdropping STARS tokens to hand-picked NFT communities on Ethereum can drive wallet, user, and fund migration from Ethereum to Stargaze and Cosmos. 
 Pilot: To prove that this model works, Stargaze will partner with Levana Protocol, an experienced team that has grown a loyal, charismatic community of devoted NFT collectors. 
 How it works: 
 Users will navigate to a website: (URL TBD)
 1) User connects metamask and keplr
 2) user signs a plaintext message on metamask (aka ""I want a Winter Pal"")
 3) User signs transaction on Keplr wallet (it will say something like ""submit for airdrop"")
 4) There will be an airdrop contract on our side, that is able to compute valid eth sig and keplr sig
 5) That same contract, will a) send the user 3000 STARS and b) add them to the desired whitelist
 6) User gets a response message something like ""You have received 3000 STARS and added to Winter Pals whitelist!""
 7) User can then go mint their winter pal at the whitelist date we set
 Why 3,000 STARS tokens? The STARS tokens will be a bonus invite prize for participating in the POC of bridging accounts from Ethereum to Stargaze.
 About Levana: Levana was a Blue Chip protocol on Terra before moving over to Cosmos. 
 Levana has one of the most active communities, with 30,600 Twitter followers and 11,800 Discord members. 
 Twitter: https://twitter.com/Levana_protocol
 Discord: https://discord.com/invite/levana
  Here are some Levana Highlights:
 Most successful NFT Mint on Terra. $3.7M with $7.6M in secondary market sales.
Most owned NFT collection on Terra by wallet. *Second only to TNS.
 Levana’s role: - Engage & educate the hodlers community by holding bi-weekly AMAs and creating and promoting explanation videos, providing live Twitter & discord support. Levana will reward each bridged wallet with a free Crypto Winter Pal from the Winter pals collection.
   KPI: There are 1279 wallets currently hodling Rekt Dragon NFTs on Ethereum. https://opensea.io/collection/levana-rekt-dragons waiting for the secondary drop of crypto winter pals guaranteed to all Rekt Dragon hodlers. These wallets were all previously rekt on Terra 
 We believe that the following metrics will be key indicators of success. 
 1,000 Ethereum wallets bridge to Stargaze within a 2-week pilot period. 
 Five hundred wallets engage in 3,000 STARS sales volume in the first 30 days. 
 Ask: A total of 3,837,000 STARS <3,000 STARS multiplied by 1,279 wallets.> There will be a 50-day claw-back period. All unclaimed STARS will be returned to the community pool within 50 days of the launch date. Funds will be held in a 3 of 4 multisig with 2 signers from Levana, Levana Comms and Michael, Humanalgorithm from Stargaze and Alkadeta the validator. 
 Conclusion: Stargaze believes that it can funnel quality NFT collections and its communities from Ethereum to Stargaze. To quickly and effectively prove or disprove this assumption, Stargaze will run a 50-day pilot in partnership with the Levana team. If this pilot proves successful, the Stargaze team will look to repeat this model with other leading NFT communities on an ongoing basis moving forward.",0.22770402579557625

"Badges v1.1 Update

This proposal requests uploading the v1.1.0 version the Badges Hub contract. The logics for migrating the contract state can be found at: [here](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges/blob/dc485bd4125fa105454451587b5591f845b27db9/contracts/hub/src/upgrades/v1_1.rs).

This update includes two changes:

## 1. Separate data fee rates for metadata and claim keys

**Background:** Since Stargaze chain uses zero gas price, the Badges contract decides to charge a ""data fee"" to discourage spamming attacks. The fee is charged when creating a new badge and when adding claim keys to an existing badge, the amount being proportional to the storage space taken by the new data. Currently, the fee rate is set to 200,000 `ustars` per byte of data.

**The problem:** At the current fee rate, the cost for adding claim keys is quite high. It takes ~140 STARS or ~US$7 to add 10 keys. To host an event of 200 people would thus require ~US$140 just to upload the claim keys, which is unbearable for many badge creators. On the other hand, it is reasonable that keys have a lower fee rate than metadata, as whereas metadata are to be kept on chain forever, claim keys are deleted once used.

This update introduces separate fee rates for metadata and keys. Specifically, metadata fee rate will still be 200,000 `ustars` per byte, while for keys the rate is reduced to 10,000 `ustars` per byte.

## 2. Extend the claim deadline for badge #3

Badge #3 was supposed to be distributed at the Cosmoverse event. However, due to delays in shipping, the claim QR codes were not delivered to the recipients on time. This update extends the claim period of this badge to the end of this year (Decenber 31, 23:59:59 UTC) while the QR codes are to be distributed over email.

## Wasm code info

The source code can be find at [this repository](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges). The binaries are compiled at commit [`dc485bd`](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges/commit/dc485bd4125fa105454451587b5591f845b27db9) using [workspace-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer/tree/v0.12.9) v0.12.9.

"Extend Osmosis Pool Incentives

## Community Spend Proposal

The Stargaze core team proposes to allocate 3,450,000 STARS for two STARS pools on Osmosis to be paid for by the Stargaze community pool.

- 2,200,000 STARS will be allocated to the OSMO/STARS over 100 days
- 1,250,000 STARS will be allocated to the ATOM/STARS over 60 days

This is done to ensure the depth of the STARS liquidity pools on Osmosis.

This proposal, if passed, would distribute the requested amount to the same multi-sig account as Prop #1, #23, and #56, which will deploy the funds to the above-mentioned pools on Dec 3rd, 2022, when the current STARS incentives expire.

These incentives will go live on Dec 3rd, 2022.

## Background

The incentives program on Osmosis is expiring, and the inflation thirdening on Stargaze is happening on Jan 1st, 2023. The Osmosis incentives for the two STARS pools are somewhat low. This is due to the external incentives not being matched and the low trading volume compared to the pool size.

The incentives program is reduced to take the thirdening into account and reduce the OSMO/STARS pool on Osmosis, thereby getting higher OSMO incentives. To make sure that the OSMO/STARS pool stays highly attractive, the Stargaze core team will create a proposal on Osmosis for getting matching external incentives OSMO/STARS.

The OSMO/STARS over 100 days is extended to 100 days, whereas the ATOM/STARS is only 60 days because Stargaze is planning to launch a Stargaze AMM that will host the ATOM/STARS pool once it launches. The Stargaze core team will in the near future put forward a proposal for allocating incentives to the Stargaze AMM for the whole of 2023.

"Prop #57 Funds Reallocation

## Yes on this proposal:
You request all funds located in **stars1na5fkhzmvgtpxp3yawj2h3374zztwa5hjr7m5z** to be reallocated to the new multi-sig: 
**stars1negwpql07lfqsa7mrtvl95y87w44fca38csxky**

With new projects to be chosen through subsequent proposals.

## No on this proposal:
You request Stargaze to continue with the airdrop to Rekt Dragon holders.

### Why?
There have been calls from the Stargaze community to nullify prop #57 as the Levana team will no longer be supporting NFTs or GameFi. As explained in their blog post they only have resources to develop and support perps right now. The NFTs are planned to be spun off into an independent DAO.

As the future of Levana NFTs are uncertain many in the Stargaze community feel as if the airdrop should go to other active projects and communities.
This does not stop the Levana community from migrating to Stargaze. It removes the incentive associated with the Rekt Dragons airdrop.

#### The new multisig will consist of these signers:

Michael, Humanalgorithm (Discord), Stargaze Team <br>
Ruwan, Ruwan (Discord), Stargaze Team<br>

"Badges v1.1 Update - Badge Nft

This proposal requests uploading the v1.2.0 version the Badges NFT contract. Code changes can be found at: [here](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges/compare/v1.0.0...v1.2.0).

Changes:

- **Validation of claim keys.** The Badge Hub contract supports distribution of badges using claim keys. Specifically, the badge creator generates an secp256k1 private-public key pair, provides the public key to the contract, and distribute the private key off-chain. Users who receives the private key can claim the badge by signing a message with the private key. **Prior to v1.2.0, Badge Hub does not check the validity of the public key(s) when creating a new badge or adding claim keys to an existing badge.** If a creator uses an invalid key, they would need to re-create a new badge with a valid key. v1.2.0 introduces validation of public to prevent this issue.

- **Fix badge #17.** The creator of this badge used an Ed25519 pubkey instead of an secp256k1 one. This upgrade corrects this by substituting the invalid key with a valid one.

- **Bump all dependencies to latest versions.** cosmwasm v1.1, cw-plus 0.16, cw-nfts 0.16, launchpad 0.21.

"Appendable NFT Collection

Dear Stargaze Community & Team,

The team at PS Labs (https://twitter.com/PS_Labs) are excited to announce the launch of a new custom Smart Contract.

This contract is based on the SG721 and v2 minter protocols, but with added features that allow the contract owner to allow NFTs to be appended to an existing collection and to create collections with more than 10k supply.

We believe this contract will be useful to many projects in the Stargaze community that will benefit from its features. PS Labs are committed to continuing our operations on Stargaze, and we believe that this contract will help us to do so. We are currently in the final stages of development and plan to launch on the testnet as soon as possible.

Details

-PS Labs is launching a custom smart contract for service based collections.
-The contract is based on the SG721 and v2 minter protocols, with added features
-Features include the ability to set minting to be enabled/disabled, set the maximum number of NFTs in the collection to be more than standard fixed size of 10k, set the token_uri after initial setup making the collection ""appendable"", enabling/disabling the avaibility of mint only to owner of the contract
-The ability to add NFTs to an existing collection can be useful for projects that offer NFTs as a service to their users
-This allows the project to easily add new NFTs to the collection as needed, without having to create a new contract for each new batch of NFTs
-This can save time and resources, and make it easier for the project to manage and distribute their NFTs
-This ensures that the collection can continue to grow and adapt to the needs of the project and its users.
-To be fair with the collection's creation fee an additional cost will be required to the creator as adding
 nfts after the 10k standard limit

To help us continue our efforts to make this contract available to all, we are respectfully requesting $6000 to cover our development costs. We have so far put our own funds upfront to get the smart contract created and the smart contract is working and ready. 

We believe that by providing this contract to the community, we can help to advance the use of Stargaze Network and make it more lucrative for creators to start new and interesting project ideas. We hope that this contract will serve as a valuable tool for others in the community. Thank you for your support and interest in Stargaze & our project.

Warm regards,

"Update Collection Creation Fee

As discussed here: https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/discussion/8893-increase-collection-creation-fee

This proposal seeks to increase the collection creation fee to 3,000 STARS.

Reasoning: 

-To reduce spam collections. By increasing the collection creation cost, if the goal of the spam collections is to make a profit, an increase will greatly reduce the frequency of spam collections created as the barrier to making a profit is significantly increased. If the intent of spam collections is for another reason, an increase still causes a higher expense for spammers to create these collections and hopefully reduces this behavior.
-Reducing spam collections will benefit the ecosystem and marketplace. Less money moving into spam collections means that real collections will have greater visibility and it will be more likely for legitimate projects to see interest.
-It will help make the front end (Stargaze website) easier to navigate and find collections users would be interested in by removing this extra bloat.
-It will help user and creator retention. Fewer users will be scammed as fewer of these collections are created which helps avoid negative experiences while using the marketplace. Overall, having fewer of these spam collections will have a positive impact on the perception and presentation of Stargaze as a whole.

"Extend Osmosis Pool Incentives

## Extending the ATOM/STARS Pool Incentives on Osmosis

The Stargaze core team proposes to allocate 1,250,000 STARS for the STARS/ATOM pool on Osmosis to be paid for by the Stargaze community pool.

- 1,250,000 STARS will be allocated to the ATOM/STARS over 60 days

This is done to ensure the depth of the STARS liquidity pools on Osmosis.

This proposal, if passed, would distribute the requested LP amount to the same multi-sig account as Prop #1, #23, and #56, which will deploy the funds to the above-mentioned pools on Feb 2nd, 2023, when the current STARS incentives expire.

These incentives will go live on Feb 2nd, 2023.

The ATOM/STARS external incentives are extended 60 days to give Stargaze time to launch and test the new AMM that will host the ATOM/STARS on Stargaze itself.

Extending the incentives for the STARS/OSMO pool will be made as a separate proposal once they are close to expiring.

"Marketplace Listing Fee Update

# Listing Fee Change

## TLDR

Reduce listing fee to 0.5 STARS ($0.01).

## Background

Stargaze Marketplace has had zero listing fees since launch. But since Stargaze also has zero gas, this functionality was abused to game new listing streams (such as Hubble). 

Of course, Hubble and any future ranking site can add custom functionality to filter out repeated listings and unlistings. However this adds an additional burden on them, and could even cause future ranking sites to not include Stargaze. Since these listing transactions happen on-chain, they also add useless traffic to the network, and reduces accuracy of data, especially on third party sites and block explorers. Thus, solving this problem on the client-side turns in a game of whack-a-mole, which isn't scalable into the future as Stargaze gains more market share.

Earlier in January, a community member proposed adding a listing fee. This [Common post](https://gov.stargaze.zone/discussion/8796-nft-market-listing-fee-maximum-mint-limit-per-wallet-changes) was followed by [proposal #107](https://www.stargaze.zone/vote/proposal/107). The passing of this proposal added a 5 STARS ($0.13) listing fee.

Although this proposal passed with 99.92% YES votes, many in the community voiced concerns that the fee was excessive. Therefore, we are proposing a lower fee that will, in theory, still deter spam from happening at its previous volume while having less of an effect on normal users.

## Proposed Solution

After extensive feedback from the community, and conversations on Discord and Twitter, **we propose a listing fee reduction from 5 STARS to 0.5 STARS ($0.01)**. If STARS increases in price, then another proposal can update this fee, or a USD oracle can be used in the future to fix the fee to **1 cent USD**.

We want Stargaze to be a *minimally extractive* protocol. It should charge just enough fees to be sustainable, not more than that. Note that currently all fees on Stargaze are Fair Burned, where 50% of fees are burned, and the other 50% are sent to stakers. The only exception is Stargaze Names, where 33% of fees go to the community pool. The Core Team doesn't earn any fees.

## Services for a Governed ICS721 (Infrastructure and Operations)
Full details here: https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/discussion/9539-services-for-a-governed-ics721-infrastructure-and-operations

### About Ark Protocol

Our mission is building and providing multi-chain utilities on top of ICS721 for ALL collections and on ALL chains at ANY time. The Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) allows Cosmos chains to connect and communicate with each other.

### What is ICS721?

For a better understanding what ICS721 means and how it enables multi-chain utilities please read our blog post on ""Building Multi-Chain NFT Utilities"": https://arkprotocol.substack.com/p/nfts-and-utilities-going-multi-chain

### Summary

Ark Protocol's proposal is requesting a one-time funding of 2,000,000 STARS. This funding will cover the cost of services and operating relayer nodes for a minimum of 6 months. We are optimistic about providing ICS721 services for the rest of the year and beyond.

Ark Protocol aims to self-cover all ongoing services through an ICS721 transfer fee. Each NFT being transferred through this governed ICS721 contract will be charged a small fee. Of course, each collection is free to opt-in or opt-out and set up their own ICS721 service and infrastructure.",0.03687118741579646

"Dev Fund Update: Use Splits for Weighted Developer Rewards

## Dev Fund Update: Use Splits for Weighted Developer Rewards

On Stargaze, 15% of newly minted tokens from inflation go to developer rewards. The current parameters were set when the chain launched in Oct, 2021. A lot has changed since then, and the dev team is much bigger. Developer rewards have to be updated to reflect the new dev team.

The current allocation is 33% to Stargaze Foundation, and the rest split among the three original co-founders who were the sole members of the dev team in Oct, 2021.

This proposal updates developer rewards to use the new Splits contract. This allows a multisig to manage allocations, and make updates when new developers join and leave, and when they change their hours.

The proposed change is to update the Weighted Developer Rewards parameters to:

- 33% = Stargaze Foundation

- 67% = Splits contract

Note that the allocation to the Foundation will remain the same. However, the three co-founder allocations are replaced with a Splits contract.

This new 3-of-5 multisig, the Dev Fund Multisig, will consist of the following members: Jorge Hernandez, Shane Vitarana, Michael Scotto, Ruwan Perera, and John Yu.

This team will deploy a Splits contract with the weighted allocations for the team currently building Stargaze. This is around 10 people and includes: smart contract developers, front-end developers, backend developers, chain developers, data analysts, and biz dev.

When the proposal passes, tokens will get distributed to the Splits contract on each block. Then the funds will be automatically distributed monthly from the contract to the members based on their allocations defined in the contract.

The Stargaze Community Multisig proposes to allocate 1,980,000 STARS for the STARS/OSMO pool on Osmosis to be paid for by the Stargaze community pool.
 - 1,980,000 STARS will be allocated to the STARS/OSMO over 90 days

This is done to ensure the depth of the STARS liquidity pools on Osmosis. This proposal, if passed, would distribute the requested LP amount to a 3/5 multi-sig account, which will deploy the funds to the above-mentioned pool on March 20th 2023.

These incentives will go live on March 20th, 2023.

To make sure that the STARS/OSMO pool stays highly attractive, The Stargaze Community Multisig will create a proposal on Osmosis for getting matching external incentives on STARS/OSMO.

Extending the incentives for the STARS/ATOM pool will be made as a separate proposal once they are close to expiring.

"Stargaze Carbon Neutral Proposal

## Stargaze is leading the way as a sustainable, **carbon neutral NFT and Smart Contract platform**.

This proposal asks for a spend of **78,125 STARS** from the Community Pool to purchase and retire **500 tons** of carbon credits to **offset Stargaze’s 2023 carbon emissions** to continuing being a **carbon neutral blockchain**. 

If approved, **78,125 STARS** will be transferred to multisig wallet `stars15usuwmqg86h5n3tnvfkqksx6hxqwugtcu9vfps` for the purpose of sending to a Regen Network Development, PBC. (Public Benefit Company) controlled wallet in exchange for **500 NCT** (Nature Carbon Tons) to be retired at Stargaze retirement address `regen1satwv984d3s0kmvnlh4wnf0enh5xwgaq6v7gsc`

STARS will be sent in **12 month vesting state**, which will allow for RND, PBC to stake with Stargaze validators, but tokens would not be transferrable until the end of vesting period.

> **VOTING YES**
- Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval to address **Stargaze**’s carbon emissions footprint by purchasing **Nature Carbon Ton** to offset 2023.

> **VOTING NO**
- Voting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated.

> **VOTING NO WITH VETO**
- Voting NO WITH VETO indicates not in support, that a different follow-on proposal should be drafted, and that depositors should lose deposit.

> **VOTING ABSTAIN**
- Voting ABSTAIN indicates acknowledgement and participation in the governance process, but no opinion is wished to be expressed.

## **Method**

* Stargaze blockchain Carbon Footprint was **calculated using [Method #2: Scale of Validator Operations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-w4dBc1Svcmw_fzEKUFRgK_pga1qsGMHCTsUKUmWEA)**

* Based on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, and applying Method #2, **Stargaze** is projected to emit at most **461.53 tons a year in carbon**, negatively affecting our climate. 

* Method #2 [calculations done by Bonzi](https://gov.stargaze.zone/discussion/9402-stargaze-carbon-climate-cosmos-zero)

* **500 tons** will be used to provide a significant margin of assurance. 

* NCT will be acquired using [Option 3: Carbon credits direct from Regen Network Development, PBC](https://www.notion.so/Cosmos-ZERO-Achieve-protocol-net-zero-carbon-emissions-while-building-a-carbon-market-in-Cosmos-ddd441e3ff3d4dbda83265433843ec10) where RND, PBC will stake vested STARS received for a 12 month period.
  * Price of NCT is $2.75: 500 x 2.75 = $1,375
  * Price of STARS at time of writing is **$0.0176** and **WILL BE VALUE USED** to exchange for 500 NCT
  * 78,125 STARS (1,375/0.0176) are requested from Community Pool

## Cross-protocol Collaborations: Stargaze x Regen

**Additional context relating to Stargaze NFT community:**

The Cosmos ZERO team plans to **mint an NFT collection on Stargaze** which will represent the retired NCT and carbon neutral statuses of all Cosmos Zone protocols and validators who have offset their carbon emissions from 2017 through 2023 and have provided the appropriate TX hash as proof of the offset.

In addition, The Cosmos ZERO team is excited to support Stargaze's Earth Day NFT mint, by helping to curate and recruit **#refi NFT artists**. The team plans to seek funds from the Regen Community Pool to help co-fund some of the artists stipends, and potentially offer some NCT tokens to offset energy used to create the collection itself!

## Background

The environmental cost of blockchain technology is often cited as a problem that needs to be tackled before widespread adoption. Proof of Work consensus algorithms, such as those in use by Bitcoin and Ethereum, create an arms race of computing power in order for a miner to be the first to create a new block and so obtain the reward.

Cosmos’ Proof of Stake validation system drastically improves on this by making this competition take place over attracting more delegation of stake from users. Validators are not required to perform deliberately complicated calculations and so can run on relatively low power machines. However, these machines are still required to be online 24/7 and perform calculations to confirm each block as it is generated. This results in a carbon footprint for each blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem.

### Carbon Credits Industry

Carbon credits are real world financial assets (commodities) that are rapidly becoming tokenized onto blockchains. Demand for carbon credits is expected to become a $500 billion + industry by 2030, and is already a 6 billion annual industry.

"Development Proposal

# Proposal Compliance

 In accordance with standard practice (https://github.com/public-awesome/docs/blob/main/governance/protocol-governance.md),
  here is the attached commonwealth link: https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/discussion/6085-signalling-proposal-nftbased-validator-scripts.
  Additionally, we had a YouTube discussion with AtlasDAO and @CosmosDefi about the proposal and project among other things.


  # Create NFT Based Distribution Scripts

This CommunityPoolSpend would immediately fund the creation of scripts and programs to enable automatic
  distribution of staking rewards and commission from a validator to delegators based upon NFT holdings. Since Stargaze revolves around the success
  of NFTs as an industry, this functionality will provide another utility case for holding NFTs, creating reflexive growth for the ecosystem.
  Additionally, this will increase the capability of DAOs on Stargaze. A validator could DAOify and then instead of using its own token
  it could utilize $STARS through the NFT holdings to participate in governance decisions. It is imperative to continue building out market use cases
  during the bear market. 

# Wallet + Funds

The Wallet is a new wallet for full
  transparency. We will stake our grant to multiple validators outside of the top 50 to increase decentralization. Funds will not be sold for at least 6 months.
  With the CommunityPool at 294 million, this request is ~.34% of the pool.

# Proof of Concept

The basic structure of the main effort is to take a minter call →
  address array → array analytics → claiming commission & rewards → querying of state → calculating share per address → iteration for distribution →
  automation.

#Other

Our team has minted 3 collections on the stargaze network and our tutorial was integrated into the official stargaze documentation:
  https://docs.stargaze.zone/guides/readme. We have an open PR to improve other docs. We also plan to launch stargaze nodes on cosmos ecosystem partner Akash and aid in the development of ecosystem
  projects, such as NFT trackers and voluntary signatory verification of project creators.",0.3123471299608866

"Ethereum Onboarding Platform

Objective: Onboard the most active Ethereum NFT communities to Stargaze. Stargaze has witnessed spectacular growth in the past months due to its unique value proposition for NFT collectors. On the flipside, Ethereum NFTs are in stagnation, and their community is looking for something more... 

Hypothesis: We believe that onboarding Ethereum users to Stargaze will be mutually beneficial. Stargaze will see an uptick in community growth, volume, and benefit from the knowledge transfer of an established NFT user base. Ethereum collectors will enjoy a welcoming Stargaze community, an innovative blockchain dedicated to NFTs, and profit from the numerous perks of being on Cosmos (including lower gas fees). 

Proof of concept: Rekt Gang DAO aims to demonstrate that the concept of airdropping STARS tokens to select NFT communities on Ethereum can drive wallet, user, and fund migration from Ethereum to Stargaze and Cosmos. Driving the ethos of Cosmos, and its collaborative nature. 

Pilot: To prove that this model works, Stargaze will partner with Rekt Gang DAO and MintDAO, both experienced teams in their field that have consistently delivered on their roadmap. Noteworthy, both teams have over delivered on their initial value proposition and never asked the community for additional funds, or adopted NFT ponzinomics. 

We aim to develop a model that will provide a friendly user experience on top of being scalable and interoperable with multiple NFT projects on Ethereum, as well as the wider Ethereum Virtual Machine (Polygon, Avalanche, etc…)..

How it works, Users will navigate to a website: (URL TBD) 
1. User connects metamask and keplr. 
2. User signs a plaintext message on metamask saying: ""My stargaze address is <addr>"" 
3. User interacts with an airdrop contract on stargaze sending previously signed message to receive 420.69 stars. This contract validates ETH signature and checks eligibility. 
4. User gets a response message along the lines of ""You have received 420.69 STARS and welcome to Stargaze!”

The STARS tokens will be a bonus invite prize for participating in the POC of bridging accounts from Ethereum to Stargaze.

About Rekt Gang DAO: Rekt Wolf was a Blue Chip NFT community on Terra before migrating to Ethereum. Rekt Gang DAO has consistently provided educational initiatives to all NFT collectors such as analytics, project reviews, AMAs, mint trackers and many more resources in order to prevent people from getting Rekt. They are an established community on Ethereum, as they are the 1st project to migrate from Terra to Ethereum for free with EVM interoperable smart contracts (powered by LayerZero labs). Indeed, they successfully migrated more than 85% of their user base. Since their migration to ETH, they reached the top volume amongst migrated collections from Terra, as well as the highest floor price. Most recently, they partnered with a popular metaverse in the ETH community that houses many blue chips such as Azuki, Pudgy Penguins and more : https://twitter.com/rekt_gang/status/1569697765524914178?s=20&t=-Z1tPgblONaDoc9Ss7O-Aw

About Mint DAO: MintDAO is an NFT driven protocol that has developed 1st in space innovations such as yield bearing NFTs on Terra, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) interoperable NFTs. In addition, they have a unique model where the mint proceeds return to their DAO and are shared between holders (a little reminiscent of Stargaze). 

Ask: A total of 1,690,069 STARS <420.69 STARS multiplied by 830 Rekt Wolf ETH wallets for Rekt Gang DAO, and 1,340,896.3 STARS to MintDAO team for platform development> There will be a 50-day claw-back period. All unclaimed STARS by Rekt Wolf ETH holders will be returned to the community pool within 50 days of the launch date.

Conclusion: Stargaze believes that it can funnel quality NFT collections and its communities from Ethereum to Stargaze. To quickly and effectively prove or disprove this assumption, Stargaze will run a 50-day pilot in partnership with the Rekt Gang DAO and MintDAO team. If this pilot proves successful, the Stargaze team will look to repeat this model with other leading NFT communities on an ongoing basis moving forward. The deliverable (platform) will be interoperable for NFT projects on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (including projects from Polygon and Avalanche).

"Funding for Confio, developers of CosmWasm

## **Summary**

$18,000 in $STARS for three months of public goods funding to Confio to maintain Cosmwasm, the smart contract engine that powers Stargaze. The request is for 1,080,000 $STARS, any remainder will be returned to the community pool. 

## **Background**

Confio team, led by Simon Warta, Ethan Frey, and Martin Worner, is an essential part of the Cosmos ecosystem for everything they have delivered as core developers and support to all teams building, Stargaze included. Cosmwasm, an essential part of Cosmos infrastructure, is maintained by Confio. Recently, the team announced they couldn’t continue building public goods from now on.

[https://twitter.com/confio_tech/status/1620780203818754048](https://twitter.com/confio_tech/status/1620780203818754048)

[https://medium.com/confio/confios-new-path-fa82482a9f13](https://medium.com/confio/confios-new-path-fa82482a9f13)

Stargaze acknowledges the work Confio has done and will continue to do as stewards of Cosmwasm. The Stargaze Community would like to extend our help to the Confio Team, who currently has 20-30 people.

## **Cost and Rationale**

The proposal is for $18,000 in $STARS for three months of public goods funding to the Confio Team. After those 3 months have passed, a renewal of this proposal may take place. Other Cosmos projects have made similar proposals to their community. The amount requested is equivalent in proportion to other community proposals. This helps Confio continue operations and work on Cosmwasm.

The upside would be getting support from Confio’s invaluable expertise while also helping a project essential to the Cosmos ecosystem. Every mint and trade on Stargaze relies on Cosmwasm to execute.

"CronCat Factory

## CronCat Factory

The CronCat factory contract is a custom factory architecture that allows for \child\ CosmWasm contracts where new versions can be deployed.

The factory is controlled by a cw3 fixed multisig.

See https://docs.cron.cat for more info.

## Store WASM Code

Contract uploaded: `croncat_factory.wasm`

Source code: https://github.com/CronCats/cw-croncat/tree/main/contracts/croncat-factory

## Compile Instructions

CronCat consists of several smart contracts, utilizing cargo workspaces. Look in the project root for a `justfile` that contains several helper utilities.

To compile the canonical way:

```sh
docker run --rm -v \$(pwd)\:/code --mount type=volume,source=\$(basename \$(pwd)\)_cache\,target=/code/target --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.13
```

The above will take a while. \ud83d\ude3c

This results in the following checksum:

## Verify on-chain contract

```sh

"Upgrade Terra Classic To Re-enable IBC

This signaling proposal will set the course of a software upgrade that is needed on Terra Classic (Columbus-5), hereinafter called “legacy Terra”, to re-enable IBC functionality to Osmosis and Juno.

The IBC channels 1, 20, and 49 (corresponding to Osmosis, Juno, and Crescent, respectively) were set to be “CLOSED” state as part of the v0.5.20 upgrade of Terra core software (https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core/compare/v0.5.19...v0.5.20#diff-0f1d2976054440336a576d47a44a37b80cdf6701dd9113012bce0e3c425819b7L585-R615). In order for these channels to be re-enabled, their states need to be set to “OPEN” via a similar software upgrade.

- By voting YES on this proposal, delegators and validators signal that they are in favor of upgrading the legacy Terra chain to re-enable the previously closed IBC channels `channel-1` (osmosis), `channel-20` (juno) and `channel-49` (crescent)
- By voting NO on this proposal, delegators and validators signal their dissent about upgrading the legacy Terra chain for above stated reasons, or are against the way this proposal has been put up.

Why we use TerraV2 governance: the current state TerraV1 governance is in is debatable. This is a way of consulting the “new” Terra community, which was formed from two snapshots, and represents the stakeholders of the legacy Terra chain in an agreeable way.

If this proposal passes, the next step will be to prepare the software upgrade and propose it on legacy Terra, where legacy delegators and validators can have a final agreement.",0.10447007317399455

"Backbone Labs - Audit Request


As discussed in https://agora.terra.money/discussion/10945-backbone-labs-audit-lp-proposals this proposal is to audit the boneLuna suite of contracts.

We believe in good security hygiene, and as such, we believe we should re-audit our codebase on a regular basis, to ensure our systems still up to date with the latest good security practices, and the people using our systems are in good hands.

In order to do so we are asking the Terra community for ~35k USD of Luna to fund this. 

The funds will go directly to the audit provider.

We have selected SCV to lead this audit. SCV has conducted previous audits on this codebase, and are quite familiar with liquid staking, and have audited our contracts before.

If this proposal is successful, SCV commits to converting the Luna to USDC, and refunding any different back to the community pool",0.05541164173184839
"Lion DAO Treasury Grant

The Lion DAO was created to test, demonstrate & promote Enterprise.money - the automated, no-code DAO creation tool recently launched on Terra by TFL. Alongside this, we aim to showcase the various tools & protocols that Terra has to offer through partnerships & integrations. Finally, we want to support the Terra Builders' strategy of showcasing the power of Cosmos & IBC.

This proposal requests 50,000 LUNA to be transferred to the Lion DAO treasury in order for the DAO to be able to demonstrate & implement various DeFi strategies using LUNA both on-chain & interchain across the Cosmos.

We have an opportunity to continue to promote and bring attention to the Terra blockchain by granting a LUNA allocation to the Lion DAO treasury that can be used to demonstrate both the power of Enterprise.money & the utility of LUNA both on-chain and beyond.

This can also serve as an example to builders that if they come and build on Terra & generate some activity there’s a path to community pool funding where needed.

For full details of the Lion DAO proposal please see here: https://agora.terra.money/discussion/11084-lion-dao-treasury-grant

If this proposal is approved - we will deploy an additional 25Bn (2.5% of total supply, 5% of circulating supply) of the DAO governance token as an airdrop via a Coinhall Genie campaign on top of the 50Bn that was already distributed through that methodology.

"Alliance Signaling Proposal

This proposal aims to 1) incentivize Alliance adoption and the formation of mutually beneficial economic alliances between LUNA and other Cosmos ecosystems and 2) cross-pollinate users and liquidity between Terra and allied chains. To accomplish these goals, we propose allocating a combined 3% of LUNA staking rewards to at least one LSD from the first ten Cosmos chains that integrate Alliance and add a LUNA LSD as an Alliance asset with a positive yield. A “Yes” vote signals support for TFL to develop a protocol that automatically recalculates and distributes these LUNA staking rewards to each foreign LSD Alliance asset based on the yield the allied chain offers to LUNA LSD Alliance stakers. The higher the APR, the higher the RewardWeight the allied chain’s LSDs will be allocated on Terra.

This proposal outlines two solutions for the Terra community:

A natively-issued USD-backed stablecoin for Terra 2.0 ($USDS)

A fiat-to-stablecoin gateway for Terra dApps & wallets (Stably Ramp)

$USDS is issued via Stably and Prime Trust, our regulated trust company partner and qualified custodian. It is a compliant stablecoin that is backed 1-to-1 with USD funds held by Prime Trust, with monthly collateral attestations done by Cohen & Co. It securely bridges liquidity to the other blockchains that $USDS is issued natively on, such as Ethereum, Harmony, Stellar, and 7 more, with Ripple and Polymesh coming soon. 

Stably Ramp is a multichain on/off ramp widget that supports 200+ countries with a wide variety of payment methods accepted and lower fees than the competition. $USDS and Stably Ramp together not only bridge TradFi with DeFi but bridge the Terra ecosystem to many other emerging blockchains.

Entities can now conduct their day-to-day transactions, such as salaries, purchases, or donations, without worrying about their privacy. But that is only a small piece of the puzzle.

This grant is to build the missing pieces:
- Proof of Innocence (PoI) - Facing regulatory challenges, PoI builds upon the existing capabilities of Redacted and allows entities to prove that their deposits are not from sanctioned, blacklisted addresses or illicit activities. 
- The Interchain Privacy Suite; enables seamless redacting of interchain transactions, allowing anonymous transactions for all crypto users, initially available on any IBC/EVM chain.

This creates a virtuous cycle where (1) users select Chai at a merchant's checkout page (2) Chai/Terra tx volume increases which in turn increases Terra money supply (seigniorage creation) (3) seigniorage is allocated to Chai which then uses it as a budget for providing promotion discounts (4) Users are incentivized to use Chai at checkout due to seigniorage-driven promotional schemes.
Given the scale of current Chai transaction volumes, its potential to capture even more volume through continued business growth, and its clear value proposition for both the Terra ecosystem and users shoppping for everyday goods and services, it is our firm belief that Chai provides the highest ROI for seigniorage spent at this juncture.",0.05732646015205656

Author: Tanwa Arpornthip
- BLOCK research team, Prince of Songkla University, Phuket campus

I'm proposing to add TerraTHB stablecoin. 

Crypto communities in Thailand have been excited about Terra and projects on Terra (Mirror, especially).

THB is also #15 by marketcap on https://fiatmarketcap.com/. This is only two spots below CHF and four spots above SGD. Both CHF and SGD are already on Terra.

If TerraTHB is added, Thai users will receive the following benefits:
- An access to a decentralized, THB stablecoin
- Ability to include THB into a risk-diversified investment portfolio with other fiat currencies

Non-Thai users will receive the following benefits:
- An exposure to a strong currency. THB has been making a strong gain against most currencies in the last 5 years. https://www.tradingview.com/x/EDyG9sWG/
- A potential exposure to a developing-country’s economy in SEA. While SGD is already on Terra, but SG is a developed country. An exposure to Thai economy could help diversify investment in this region.

"Rapid Grants to Accelerate Ecosystem Development with Committee Oversight

Goals and Impacts
- Create a high-velocity pool of capital to take advantage of opportunities within Terra.
- Establish 3rd parties to verify quality and keep initiatives accountable to high-leverage use of community resources.
- Increase overall metabolism and rate of innovation within the Terra Ecosystem.

Rapid grants will be deployed to accelerate teams the Terra Ecosystem Committees believed to be essential to ecosystem development and the overall health of the Terra ecosystem. Thus, we will move fast to secure opportunities within the ecosystem.

- Rapid Grants pool fund to be seeded with an initial 300K LUNA to provide funding for teams that would benefit the ecosystem via rapid funding. For example, upcoming hackathons/sponsorships, and teams that the Committee would like to expose to the Terra Ecosystem heavily.
- The initial funding will be for Q3 and Q4 of 2021 encompassing August 1 (or whenever proposal passes, whatever happenss earlier) to December 31st, 2021.
- In this format, funding decisions are to be made within 72 hours of the formal submission of a proposal. This is opposed to the potential 4-week period of a proposal review by TFL as well as the two-week on-chain vote period, which provides flexibility for teams to maintain high shipping velocity. Teams will still be required to submit all necessary proposals and milestone documentation. All funding will be auditable on-chain. However, select teams will be eligible for distribution via a rapid grant.
- The Terra Ecosystem Committee will vote on all Rapid Grants and a simple majority will be needed to approve a Rapid Grant. Rapid Grants are to be recorded in public via the public Terra Ecosystem page for community records.
- Rapid Grants bypass the on-chain vote and instead delegates authority to internal TFL members to issue grants.
- The Rapid Grants pool will also be used to fund expenses related to the program including Hackathon development, sponsorships, and other community initiatives (CosmWasm course development, etc), creation of podcasts, institutional reports, conferences, etc. to increase overall developer supply.

Process for future community pool spends.

Community Pool Grants are designed to allow teams to make proper use of our community pool by setting actionable milestones to be audited by both the community and Terra Ecosystem Committee members. Through this process, we aim to support teams in developing and adhering to actionable milestones that deliver value to the Terra ecosystem.

Grant Sizes
- $1k to $30k - grant size for teams that are developing within the Terra Ecosystem that have a new concept they are attempting to work on. All teams that have never received community pool funds will be defaulted into this grant size unless all team members have previously (1) accepted funds from the Community Pool and (2) successfully implemented all milestones with success.
- $30k to $100k - only available as follow-on funding to teams that have met initial milestones and have previously successfully executed on a smaller grant size.

With the integration, users can now trade maximum returns on Terra-based assets executed by OpenOcean Atlantic, our second version, which provides an algorithm optimized for maximum returns that cannot be found anywhere else.

We would like to propose a trading competition on OpenOcean in partnership with Terra and leading Terra projects.

This will allow our 400,000 active user base to be introduced to the Terra ecosystem and Terra-based assets - increasing awareness and bringing on more users to Terra.

For this, we would like to ask the Terra community for 20kUSD worth of LUNA to allocate for campaign rewards.",0.01692043850142429

"Lower the tax rate to 0.2% and set aside 10% of tax revenue to finance ecosystem infrastructure and contributors

This proposal aims to signal to CEXs and other on-chain users that we would like to keep the tax, while using its revenue efficiently by funding the costs associated with development, the LCD endpoint, and costs related to contributions for past-and-present contributors, either individuals or organizations like Terra Rebels.
The burn tax proposed in Prop 3568 and implemented and distributed in Prop 4159 was implemented on 2022-09-21. Since then, on-chain transaction volume for LUNC has decreased by -91.67%, a difference of -3.45% since measurements taken after 7-days for the initial signal proposal [1: Signal Proposal]. 
The chain has totaled ~367.06b units over a period of 18 days, averaging 20.39B units of LUNC in daily volume in LUNC-only. Prior to the tax, on-chain transaction volume totaled 2,349.06B units of LUNC over a period of 12 days, averaging 195.76B units of LUNC daily.
With the current implementation, stakers, and spot-holding LUNC investors do not pay taxes, and therefore do not incur any burns except of their own volition by sending money to the burn wallet. On the other hand, trading and sending assets over the chain incur burns. If native assets are sent to CEXs, they are only taxed on the send and withdraw. 
Each CEX pays a discretionary burn tax in this regard, and differs between CEXs. Additionally, CEXs pay more taxes than on-chain users or voluntary burners. Of the estimated 14.85B LUNC units burned, CEXs account for 6.87B units (46.22% of all burns) [2: Lunc Penguins: Top Burners]. 
It is estimated that the burn tax will take anywhere between 20 - 60+ years to create a 10B fixed units of LUNC supply [3: Burn Tracker: LUNC Tech], an estimate currently impossible using current numbers due to 676.90B units of LUNC bonded to the network earning yield.
Core Reasoning - 0% use of Tax Revenue
We are not burning nearly enough LUNC at the current tax rate to justify the costs of its implementation. From a high-level standpoint, CEXs creating nearly half of the burns suggest that traders create nearly half of the volume. Additionally, Terra Rebels and similar contributors do not receive compensatory payment for any work they do or have done, including the actual implementation of the tax. Most of this work has been done for free outside of a regular job.
At a static, naive price of $0.0003 / LUNC, the LUNC community has burned approximately $4,470,000 worth of LUNC, either through generated revenue, or voluntarily. None of this money is used to fund the blockchain ecosystem’s growth or compensate its core maintainers.
Core Reasoning - Validators
Validators, who produce blocks for the chain, earn commission by levying fees whenever transactions occur. Validators can only sustain running the blockchain for so long before they become unprofitable to the point where they must shut down. If validators become collectively unprofitable, the blockchain shuts down without new ones taking their place. Any tokens that ‘live’ on-the-chain are not transactable without validators, meaning that users cannot cash out their holdings.
Core Reasoning - Traders
In the current tax implementation, a basic swap incurs a 1.2% tax on the face value of the transaction. For some dApps that incurred multiple transactions through their contracts, the user would be charged 1.2% per-swap. For example, when using the LunaPunksNFT marketplace, the user would be taxed once when making a bid, and again when withdrawing the bid. Regardless of if the bid was filled, they would be taxed. If the bid was filled, they would be taxed.
Main Proposal
By decreasing the tax rate, CEXs and other off-chain holders may be encouraged to return on-chain to enact trading, sustaining the cost for validators to run the chain by creating an environment where higher demand can succeed with less penalty.
We lower the burn tax rate from 1.2% to a significantly lower value as a temporary compromise to encourage traders to come back on-chain. Therefore, we also propose to fund the people who made the LUNC Community and the burn tax possible, as well as fund necessary infrastructure such as an up-to-date LCD endpoint.
The tax outline suggested is as-follows:
1.	Immediate decrease of the tax rate to 0.2% on all transactions.
2.	Levy 0.02% the calculated tax pre-burn to ecosystem funding.
After implementation, we reassess the on-chain tax depending how the ecosystem has changed.

"Add Ability To Deposit/Buy LUNC & USTC Directly On Terra Station

We all discuss bringing utility back to the chain, and that would be great to bring all old utility back to the classic chain. However, there is new utility that has already been added to the chain in the form of NFTs or gaming. There are a few future utility projects such as Lunatics token potentially bridging over to the classic chain. Currently, doing any business on-chain requires a middleman (CEX's) to deposit/buy your LUNC. It would make everything 10 times easier to just buy their LUNC directly on Terra Station to stake, buy NFTs, buy other coins on the chain, etc. I propose that we add the ability to buy LUNC direct from terra station using a third-party payment platform such as Moonpay, Transak or even paypal. I am pretty sure that we would have to allocate coins to a LP wallet to fund the transactions, but no matter how it gets done, this would help transactions on chain to be a lot easier and happen more frequently. Thus, increasing the burns. Once This is passed, then we can figure out the logistics of getting this all to work. This should be step one to increasing on-chain volume for LUNC & USTC.

"Initiative to Increase Luna Classic Proposal Deposit Amount From 0 to 500,000 $LUNC & from 345,000 to 1,000,000 to initiate Voting Phase

This proposal aims to signal to implement a parameter change toward increasing the amount of LUNC needed to submit a governance proposal within Terra Classic governance.

We currently have a MASSIVE issue where a large amount of individuals are submitting malicious proposals directing others toward scam websites / fake airdrops for LUNC. The issue being is that it currently only costs 0.01 LUNC to submit a proposal & while this is great for allowing many to submit proposals toward our blockchain it has also more often than not harmed individuals with these fake proposals. I've seen this first hand many times with those in my audience being taken advantage of through these fake proposals.

We seek a simple fix of making it more expensive to submit a proposal so that we can either punish those making fake proposals or make sure that with this added cost individuals truly believe in what they're pushing out.

500,000 LUNC at current prices is $125 or 1 LUNA at near previous ATH so this should NOT pose as a significant change to governance.

With the launch of Terra Blockchain, Luna held by the foundation was initially delegated to stabilize the network.
Currently, the Foundation delegates more than 40% of the total delegated volume across the network.
About 260 million Luna have been delegated to the entire network and 113 million Luna from the foundation.

"Community Grant Proposal for User Outreach and Onboarding to Terra

AuraStake is excited to help spread the word about $UST and $LUNA, and as part of our validator work, we now have an opportunity to onboard potential clients into the ecosystem.

We are seeking a one-time marketing spend, up to 1,052 LUNA (~$42k at $40 / LUNA) to help bolster general awareness of and support for this ecosystem. The actual amount shall be disbursed only upon the requisite condition being met i.e., having $LUNA locked in a BSC wallet for a 30-day period. The marketing spend shall be paid immediately into the validator wallet at the end of the 30 days.

The marketing spend will be calculated as follows:

Rewards to Clients + AuraStake Expenses; where

Rewards to Clients = Total LUNA staked * 5% * 30/365
AuraStake Expenses = Rewards to Clients * 1% + 14 LUNA

"Community Grant Proposal: LunaFest Decentralised Crypto Festival

Our vision and community proposal is to establish an annual, not-for-profit showcase event - powered by the Terra Luna Blockchain - that brings together crypto-natives and non-natives in a dynamic, fun and informative festival environment. 

The year 1 ‘genesis’ LunaFest will be hosted at a palatial manor house in the stunning English countryside, with a focus on live music, world class DJ’s, cutting edge entertainment and knowledge-sharing from global blockchain industry experts. 

LunaFest will become the world’s first Cryptocurrency festival, where the preferred currency will be UST with discounts, giveaways and promotions as a reward. 

To achieve all this we’ve gathered a rockstar team of committed Lunatics from around the community, who are ready to deliver an event that will - literally - bring Luna to the world and change how festivals and live music are delivered, forever. 

We will build LunaFest to become a key event in the global crypto calendar, known as a playground for gathering like minds, sharing ideas, having fun and, most importantly, helping to onboard non-natives and expand the Terra ecosystem. 

This is ‘your’ festival and we need your help to do this, so let’s make it happen together…!

"Community Funding Proposal: Accelerate TIX Protocol Development

Full Proposal: https://agora.terra.money/t/community-funding-proposal-accelerate-tix-protocol-development/4627

We are requesting 3 million UST to accelerate the development of the TIX platform. TIX will allow the community to have direct access to the trillion-dollar a year live events industry; this does not include metaverse events that TIX will also be building in functionality for. This means that the general public will begin accessing Terra through TIX, thereby bringing in new users and new money to the ecosystem.

Our aim is to open source our smart contract code once the project completes V2 on our roadmap. This project does not exist without the inspiration and good will of other open source projects within the Terra community. As such, we want to contribute and help inspire future projects to utilize their ingenuity, skillsets, and passion to build other incredible projects on Terra, solve vital world problems, and drive even more UST demand and adoption.

Why Community Funding?
This community funding will allow us to accelerate the development of TIX without taking a substantial amount of private funding in order to implement all of the core functionality. We can then dedicate the maximum number of resources to developing game-breaking technology that will deliver the most value to our ecosystem and its users.

Should the community approve this funding, we will be able to allocate tokens that would have been used to raise from VCs, back to the community in the form of Luna staker airdrops and community engagement rewards.",0.4001394703229271

Shall we try one more time, with UST?
Mint and Burn process.
Don't give up on UST, the path is correct, just one correction and everything will be restored.

shall we recap, calmly?
The bottom of the river is better visible when the water calms down....
What happens when creating a UST or LUNA?

1) Why did it lose value? disregard overselling...
2) How is the real value of the UST physically composed and guaranteed? 1 UST:USD 1 in Bank?
3) What about Gold?

My suggestion is to keep LUNA and create GLUNA...
When a new UST is created, a part of the GLUNA and LUNA must be used for BALLAST.
LUNA would continue operating from the ""brokers"" ecosystem, but GLUNA would not, it would only be internal UST Support,
So we would have 2 tokens supporting the UST not just one
This last one in pure gold, hence GLUNA.
In the process of mint a UST, a part of LUNA and a part of GLUNA would be used.
So the next UST would be created from this 2 tokens
UST backed by GLUNA 50-70% (depending on swing) LUNA 20-50%
As more UST or LUNA is purchased, a portion of GLUNA would go into the recipe to strengthen our blessed DOllar.

So you can keep what already exists and strengthen the new UST generated through business normally.... Life that goes on...

"Mint and Burn UST (redesign)

No despair, let's go?

The biggest problem is when you create a UST based only on LUNA, you are subject to all kinds of market mess.
The GLUNA would be an internal currency, fully backed by gold.
Thus, at the time of minting 1 UST, it would use part LUNA and part GLUNA. GLUNA cannot be traded outside the ecosystem and must have its price and quantity based on GOLD.
At the time of minting, UST must have its largest share in the value of the gold price. Gold always beats the dollar, probably, our dollar UST, in this way, it will always be above or equal to 1 dollar if new UST is generated.
As the days go by, the UST will regain its value and everything will get even better.

Market economics make it impossible for investors to recover their money with all aforementioned recovery strategies, this proposal aims at recovering 100% of capital for everyone that had balances in any type of form in the terra ecosystem before de-peg.

1. We will do a hard fork before the attack as proposed by Do but with old addresses called “founder addreses” and new regular addreses, from this point forward, only new regular non founder addresses on the ecosystem will be created.
2. Have the system implement a 0.5% fee on all transactions on the terra network for a reconstitution fund.
3. Redirect the money of the fund as it flows into the system to the affected addresses only (aka founder addreses) in a pro rata calculation, only when the address continues to be active (i.e. The address has not been abandoned promoting old users to come back to the environment) and up to the point the user is made whole at current market price, this promotes old users to come back and trade and the liability goes down as the price of Luna2 goes up, recovery and repayment of all funds will take a couple of months but given
4. Distribute a percentage bonus (after everyone is repaid) for those that remained with their balance at UST and those that bought Luna during its collapse.

Hi everyone, I have an idea for discussion that I think could bring the Tyra classic back to life.
I think the design of the entire Terra Classic is that USTC and LUNC are symbiotic, and the root cause of all this is the decoupling of USTC, and now we just need to do everything we can to make USTC re-pegged to 1 dollar, then USTC and LUNC can start flying again.
At present, the price of USTC is 0.012U, the total amount is about 10.2 billion, and the market value is 122 million US dollars. And there are still 313 Bitcoins, 39914 BNBs, 1973554 AVAXs, and 1847079725 USTCs in LFG's reserves. I calculated that the value of the reserves is about $67900000. This value is excluding USTC.
Can we take a snapshot of the USTC holdings and issue a coin with USTC 1:1 AUSTC (the name is written casually). We only have $67,900,000 in circulation, and the rest is frozen, so that our Thai zipper can operate normally and generate profits, and then a part of the profits goes into LFG's reserves to continue to support the peg, and we unfreeze it every month or every day as the profit grows , so we can have hope.",0

0.01% burn Luna Clasic in all transactions of the entire terra ecosystem until arriving 5.000.000.00

Voting of equal conditions of the entire community of Luna. Neither vote weighs more than the other.

All validators will have a vote equal to the community.

Example:

If there are 100 validators, they will agree themselves to decide their vote. Thus it weighs the same as that of the community.

Luna Clasic will be used as a test engine to implement new projects to the new Terra ecosystem.

Remove the UST from Luna Classic.

Have a backup wallet of any cryptocurrency or stablecoin in case of disaster.

The wallet or wallets will be held by the validators as they have made the effort to rebuild the project.

This wallet will be monitored so that the holders can see it on any movement.

In case of any movement that has not been asked or reported, the validator will be expelled.

The validators will have a donation from the community for the effort they would make monthly.

The validators will agree on what cryptocurrency they will receive for their efforts. This vote will be published on terrastation monthly.

Since there was this disaster. The community and the validators must take control of the project.

In summary:

-Decentralization.

-Vote equally for everyone.

-Remove UST completely.

-Verification of any Lunc token vulnerability.

-Wallet or Wallets de backup

-Reward for validators

Hello! We are a team of artists and developers who are currently working on a project of Play to Earn game. One of the goals of our project is entertaining game content in the RPG genre, as well as burning LUNC, which will be an in-game currency. The concept of introducing LUNC into our game:
In-game purchases will be made for LUNC, 70 percent of which after the transaction will be collected for a single wallet aimed at burning, which will help improve the state of the token. 25 percent is directed towards supporting the continued economy of the game and rewarding users for completing daily tasks, tournaments, and completing PvE content. 5 percent will be kept by the developers of the game. An analysis of the gaming market shows that the circle of users who are interested in investing their resources in the gaming process is growing every year, but at the same time, not a single game was launched on the Terra network despite the growing interest in the industry. In this way, it will be possible to expand the community's ability to burn and at the same time generate more interest in the ecosystem.
To date, we have developed an NFT collection that will be the first step towards the implementation of the game. Our collection was developed on the Ethereum blockchain but not so long ago we learned that you are launching your own NFT marketplace on the Terra network. Despite recent circumstances, we would like our collection and future game to exist in your ecosystem, which we consider very promising. Do you find this offer interesting within your ecosystem?

"Fix IBC transfers between Lum Network and Osmosis

This proposal replaces proposal #256. We kindly ask OSMO stakers to consider proposal #256 voided and to reject it in favour of this current proposal.

== Proposal replacement details ==

This new proposal introduces a new IBC client 07-tendermint-1991 to replace legacy client 07-tendermint-1987 on channel Osmosis(115) and LumNetwork(3).
The previous proposal used the legacy client 07-tendermint-1987 which ran into a trusting out-of-period, and thus got voided by protocol.
The Lum team alongside some of the Lum Network validators have now upgraded their tools to frequently update the new client 07-tendermint-1991 and deprecated the periodic updates of legacy one.

== Description ==

Lum Network IBC channel is currently in a frozen state following the Osmosis chain halt of the past few days.
This issue is known and has already been dealt with successfully in January 2022 where it was heavily tested prior to making a governance proposal.
The detail of the previous unfreeze operation is available here: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/115

Lum Team is now ready to proceed with a new channel unfreeze to restore connection between Lum & Osmosis.

Proposal goal:

This proposal will enable the unfreezing process of the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network, thus allowing deposits and withdrawals of $LUM on the Osmosis platform:

- By voting YES, OSMO stakers voice their support in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network
- By voting NO, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in unfreezing the IBC channel between Osmosis and Lum Network

This proposal has no effect beside enabling back the IBC connection between the two chains.

Details:

The IBC client refresh between Osmosis and the Lum Network was not possible during the Osmosis shutdown.
Shutting down the IBC connection froze the currently use channel (3-115). Meaning that no IBC transfer can be made using this channel unless this governance proposal is voted YES by OSMO stakers.

"External Incentive Matching reduction within non-OSMO categories

* Voting YES for this proposal indicates that incentive categories not containing OSMO as a component should have external incentive matching capped as follows.
    * Reduction in the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%
    * Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1

* Voting NO for this proposal indicates that all incentive categories will continue to be matched at a maximum 1:1 value ratio

**Example:** https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1413b2b3-9d38-4865-8717-ba9a8ba4d0e7.1655974330412 
As an example of the proposed model, both FOO/OSMO and FOO/ATOM pools generate 30k per day in swap fees and have 15k provided in external incentives.  Currently Osmosis will match all 15k of these external incentives in both pools.  The line that reads 'Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1' causes the FOO/ATOM pools to have 7.5k spent on matching compared to 15k on FOO/OSMO pools.
 This is further limited if the fees generated are lower. In a scenario where both pools generate 5k per day in swap fees, currently, 5k of the 15k external incentives would be matched in both pools.  The line that reads 'Reduction in the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%' causes this 5k to be reduced to 1667 in matching on the FOO/ATOM pool.
i.e. to achieve full matching the pool would need to generate 45k in swap fees.
N.B. Example is weightings of fee allocation rather than actual figures.

### Background
External Incentive matching was first established in [Proposal 47](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) to incentivize their addition to Osmosis pools. This quickly grew into a major driver for incentive allocation following chains such as Stargaze, Chihuahua and Comdex adding large external incentives in comparison to the normal Osmosis incentive structure.
In order to preserve incentives for established projects, without external incentives but important for the growth of Osmosis as the IBC decentralised exchange, governance voted in Proposals [128](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/128) and 133 to implement a bias factor around how fees were used to calculate external incentive matching as well as a cap on matched Osmosis incentives relative to un-matched Osmosis incentives
The bias factor was defined as:

The same bias factor that is used for all incentivized pools within Osmosis. If the bias factor system (or equivalent preferential treatment for certain base asset) changes as time goes on, the external incentive matching should adapt in the same fashion.

At the time, this was a requirement of  equivalent of fees to be generated in a non-OSMO pool to provide the same matched incentives as  equivalent of fees in an OSMO pool as well as capping the match at up to 50% of the external incentive value.
Proposal 233 reworked the incentive system to use a set of categories to allocate incentives to pools based on their component assets rather than a bias system and so there was no new preferential treatment system for the matching system to adapt to, causing all external incentives to be matched equally in all pools.
This proposal asks that the previous matching biases be re-established in the new category model by:
* Reducing the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%
* Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1

Categories affected:
* Stable/Stable
* Major/Stable
* Other

"Signaling proposal: Create a osmosis bug bounty

## Background
On the 8th June 2022 at 02:49:55 UTC a major bug in the osmosis AMM has forced the validators to halt the network at block 4713064. The issue was that withdrawing funds from liquidity pools would result in getting assets worth more than what you had in the pool. This bug could've potentially drained the assets in all liquidity pools accross osmosis by simply adding liquidity and directly removing it again. Fortunately, the damage was limited to only 5 million dollars due to the fast reaction of the validators. However, apart from the financial damage, the 3-day shutdown also cost a lot of trust, which has to be earned again in the long term.

## Bug Bounty/Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
To prevent the malicious exploitation of such bugs I would like to propose two things:
1. **Creation of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**
The goal of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy is to encourage people to report bugs privately to the osmosis devs before making it public. Such policy would give information about how osmosis has to react to such bug reports and also give the reporting user the security to no being persecuted legally. I'll add some examples for such policy:

    https://hackerone.com/riot?type=team
    https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/bug-fix-policy
    https://support.crowdin.com/vulnerability-policy/ 

2. **Creation of a according but bounty program**
Having a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy usually also means having a bug bounty program to incentivise the reporting of such bugs instead of abusing them. The bounty paired with the legal security should then hopefully be enough to ensure critical bugs can be fixed before being disclosed to the public.
Immunefi is a platform where many crypto projects are running their bug bounty program (Polygon, MakeDAO, THORChain, PancakeSwap, etc.). Also Sifchain is having a bug bounty program there with rewards up to 2M$.
This Bug Bounty should be funded by the strategic Osmo reserve and the community pool. Furthermore, core devs and external and independent actors should be involved in the bug bounty dao/team.


### Note
A bug bounty program doesn't mean that reported bugs are swept under the carpet. A vulnerability disclosure policy also includes when and how bugs can/will be disclosed to the public.
___
YES -> You aggree that a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure should be created and carried out. The creation itself with the exact policy will have to pass governance again.
NO -> You believe that's not neccessary and don't want a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure policy
NO WITH VETO -> You believe such policy/bug bounty would harm the network and want to prevent that at all cost",0.00035276937028834904

"Continued reduction of emissions to Liquidity Pools

* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates approval that 20% of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives should be redirected to the community pool to lower direct Osmosis inflation until governance returns it.

* Voting No for this proposal indicates that 1% shall continue to be the proportion of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives that is redirected to the community pool.

### Background 
Osmosis has been providing only 80% of the 45% (36%) of emissions to Liquidity Pools since Proposal 230.
These have now returned to the liquidity incentives as stated in the original proposal.

Since Proposal 230, Osmosis has continued to attract liquidity in major tokens despite these lowered incentives.  This is hard to see at first glance due to the market conditions but becomes much more obvious when viewing liquidity in terms of token amounts rather than value locked.

ATOM and USDC liquidity have been hit during this period by being an offramp for Terra and part of the loss due to exploited funds but have not seen a significant change in rate of growth due to the incentive spend change.

This raises the question of how much we are overpaying liquidity providers to bring their liquidity to Osmosis.  This overpayment contributes to the inflation of the Osmosis token and, if it is not required, then these tokens could be used either during the next hype period to attract new users, to pay for more teams to develop additional utilities for the Osmosis ecosystem or be used to provide incentives to other protocols building on Osmosis.

In the following model, we can see the estimated APR that a user would obtain if they were to stake the two separate halves of the liquidity pool on their own networks and how that compares with providing liquidity.  Where there is no alternative staking reward then OSMO staking APR is used as a substitute.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1irSsCJbC7uGal8I5Eb0l2M2p6M7S20aUUkgfamK_zyg/edit?usp=sharing
The estimated overspend by Osmosis LP incentives compared to these staking rewards is around 37%.

Some overspending is sensible to attract OSMO compounding in the Major/Osmo category pools where Osmosis would like to build liquidity to gain market share.  However the overspending is not only directly contributing to the inflation of the OSMO token, it may also be increasing the sell pressure on tokens such as ATOM, where the optimal use of staking rewards is currently to sell single sided into Pool 1 rather than re-stake.

This proposal initially asks for the funds originally removed for Terra Pools to resume redirection to the community pool for the foreseeable future.  If this is successful and the rate of token liquidity change continues then further proposals will be made to reduce emissions to liquidity pools even further whilst still remaining the primary liquidity mining location in the IBC.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/EVMOS

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/EVMOS (#722) pool on Osmosis.

* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/EVMOS (#722) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**
This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/EVMOS pool (#722). This pool is currently the twelfth largest OSMO pool on Osmosis by Total Value Locked containing around 1.01% of all OSMO liquidity.
At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~436 thousand OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the ~40 million OSMO from the currently enabled pools.
This proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance.

** Proposal Details**
Match external incentives provided by the Persistence team for XPRT/USDC (pool #719) and XPRT/OSMO (pool #15). The external incentives will continue for 45 epochs for 14 days bonding period. 
- By voting YES on this proposal, external XPRT incentives will be matched at ~$2,666 per day for XPRT/OSMO Pool & XPRT incentives will be matched at ~$4,444 per day for XPRT/USDC Pool
- By voting NO on this proposal, external XPRT incentives will NOT be matched at ~$2,666 per day for XPRT/OSMO Pool & XPRT incentives will NOT be matched at ~$4,444 per day for XPRT/USDC Pool

** Context **
The Persistence team has allocated 400,000 XPRT across XPRT/USDC (pool 719) and XPRT/OSMO (pool 15) that amounts to ~$320,000 over the course of 45 epochs (Started on 08-07-2022)
The XPRT incentives are as follows:
- XPRT/USDC (Pool #719): ~5,555 XPRT per day amounting to ~$4,444.
- XPRT/OSMO (Pool #15): ~3,333 per day amounting to ~$2,666.

"Governance Module Upgrade: Expedited Proposals

* By voting **Yes**, you agree to the governance module changes listed below, allowing them to be enabled during the next upgrade.

* By voting **No**, you reject the below changes to enable the expedited proposals during the next upgrade.

## Background
This is a proposal to introduce changes to the governance module and allow any future proposal to be expedited similar to the method of [Prop 225](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/225). This will give Osmosis governance built-in flexibility to act quickly in the case of emergencies.

## Details
With this feature enabled, a proposer can flag any proposal as Expedited when putting it on-chain.

If expedited, the deposit to enter voting period will be increased to 5000 OSMO. The proposal will have 24 hours to achieve a two-thirds majority of all staked OSMO voting power voting YES.

If it achieves that two-thirds majority within that time, it will be considered to have passed.

If it does not achieve the two-thirds majority within 24 hours, it will be converted to a normal proposal and run for the rest of the normal proposal period under normal rules. (If it is vetoed, even after having been converted to a normal proposal, the proposer will still lose the entire 5000 OSMO deposit.)

## Implementation
These changes will be effected by implementing the two Github repositories linked here. 

1) The original feature and spec can be found [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/240).

2) Based on the feedback from Commonwealth, the functionality for configuring a separate, higher deposit [has been added](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/254). 5,000 OSMO (as above) will be the initial parameter.

## Potential Parameter Changes for Future Governance 
The enlarged proposal deposit can of course be changed by a DAO vote. Likewise, further safety guards can and should be discussed in future threads and proposals. 

These heightened safety guards might include requiring more than a two-thirds threshold to approve an emergency proposal, or they might require an additional delay, such as a longer-than-24-hour voting period for less acute emergencies. Further, governance could add a built-in implementation delay, during which voters could change their votes as the emergency evolved or as new information and perspectives came to light, particularly if it became apparent that the expedited proposal had been subject to a governance attack.

"Osmosis v11 Upgrade

## Osmosis v11 Upgrade
This is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v11.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height **5432450**, which is estimated to occur on **Wednesday August 3rd, UTC 16:00**. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.

## Upgrade Features
This upgrade adds the following features:

### Minimum fee for messages
Implements the ability for messages to be assigned a minimum fee, without which the transaction will fail.
This minimum fee is initially implemented on:
* CreateGauge - 50 OSMO
* AddToGauge  - 25 OSMO

### Governance proposal submission deposit
Submitting a governance proposal now requires a percentage of the deposit to be filled by the proposing wallet.
This is set with the governance parameter min_initial_deposit_percent and is initially implemented as 25%.

## Getting Prepared for the Upgrade
As always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.
If using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v11/bin/.
If not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v11.0.0 binary.

## Details of Upgrade Time
The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be **5432450**, anticipated to be on **Wednesday August 3rd, UTC 16:00**. This uses an average block time of 6.2043 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown [here](**https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/5432450**)
The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.
In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.",0.0009578331642529821

The CW3 Fixed Multisig code can be found here: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/tree/v0.13.2/contracts/cw3-fixed-multisig.

"Increase Deposit for Proposals to 1600 OSMO

* Voting YES for this proposal will adjust the deposit required for a proposal to enter the voting period to 1600 OSMO.

* Voting NO for this proposal will keep the deposit required for a proposal to enter the voting period at 500 OSMO.

**Details**
The current deposit for a governance proposal is 500 OSMO, worth approximately $500 in the current market.
This was last adjusted in [Proposal 16](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/16) to align with the value of the deposit to propose on the Cosmos Hub. At the time this had a market value of $860.
1600 OSMO has a current market value of approximately $1650 and represents a more significant penalty to discourage spam proposals such as [Proposal 277](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/277).

Deposits may be filled by more than one party using the command line or wallet interfaces, such as [Commonwealth](https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposals) and [ping.pub](https://ping.pub/osmosis/gov), to ensure that the community is not priced out of governance.

Governance participants should regularly re-evaluate this parameter against OSMO price to ensure it is an appropriate spam deterrent whilst also being accessible. 

 At the current 25% deposit requirement for submission, a new proposal would also require a deposit of 400 OSMO to be filled to be posted to chain initially.

## Context

The initial ION treasury will consist of the 16572 IONs clawed back from never-active accounts from the Osmosis genesis airdrop. In Prop 120, the Osmosis DAO agreed that the Osmosis Community pool should transfer these to the ION treasury when possible and safe. The activation of the ION DAO contracts on Osmosis mainnet will serve as the trigger for this transfer.  
On testnet, about 258 IONs(almost 1.5%) were staked on the test net where it was challenging to receive faucets, 640 suggestions were made for a test, and community members shared 980 ideas and suggestions and bug reports.

## Contract
The ION DAO contracts were written with reference to similar DAO DAO contracts.

### Voting

These contracts allow ION tokens to be staked for voting power (and potentially for staking rewards, though ION has no inflation).

### Treasury

The contracts also allow for ION voting power to control a treasury by electing wallets to a multi-sig

### CosmWasm contract safety

The similar DAO DAO contracts have been safely used on Juno for a number of months. The ION DAO contracts do not tie into the Osmosis AMM and are unable to interfere with the chain logic. They have been audited by the Manythings Team. Any potential undiscovered smart contract bugs have no way of affecting OSMO because it is not custodied by the contracts. Only ION would be affected.

## Scope of Implementation

### ION Landing Page
* Develop ION’s landing page using 3D modeling and Three.js (React-fiber)
* Provide a wasm-based token balance checking feature

### ION Staking Page
* Develop wasm-based staking, unstaking, and staked balance features
* Develop total ION balance tracking feature (to be converted to governance treasury after contract integration)
* Visualize transaction maximum gas fee
* Unstake ION (14 days but in testnet 30min)

### ION Proposal List Page
* Visualize the registered proposal list
* Visualize the title, description, voting period, and voting current status for each proposal
* Can propose after staking ION. The minimum deposit for submission: is 0.05 ION, Max deposit for proposal open: is 0.5 ION. (But in the testnet, its min deposit: 50uion, max deposit: 100uion)
* Deposit another proposal that is in Pending(=Deposit period) status

### ION Voting Page
* Voting (for 7 days but in testnet 10 min)
* Enable identification of the proposal creator and its description
* Visualize proposal messages (send, execute, burn, etc.)
* The quorum is 50%, and the Threshold is 50%

"Signalling Proposal: Removal of incentives on pools #600 ATOM/CMDX & #601 CMDX/OSMO

This is a signalling proposal to phase out all OSMO incentives through the regular incentives updates from pool #600 ATOM / CMDX & #601 CMDX/OSMO, this will give Liquidity Providers sufficient time to Exit the pools, should they wish to do so. This proposal will also remove superfluid staking immediately on passage of this proposal from pool #601 CMDX/OSMO.

This is in light of the news and admission by the Comdex Foundation team that wallets connected to and funded by the Comdex Foundation nodes have been involved in volume manipulation/wash trading through Osmosis DEX and selling CMDX through OSMO to USD, in many cases on the hour, every hour since May 2022.

"Revised - [ION DAO] initialize

## Summary
Urgent announcement regarding Proposal 321:

The testnet standard parameter values in the proposal are incorrect due to typo issues. If the proposal is passed as is, the following problems might occur:

1. Short deposit / voting period allows the attacker to rush through the malicious proposal easily.
2. Low proposal deposit makes it easier to spam the DAO.

Therefore, we're submitting a new Proposal #322 with the revised parameters which we agreed with the Osmosis team as below:

Revised parameters
* unstaking period
  * `3600s` -> `1209600s` (= 14 Days)
* quorum
  * `0.3` -> `0.5` (= 50%)
* deposit period
  * `600s` -> `604800s` (= 7 Days)
* voting period
  * `800s` -> `604800s` (= 7 Days)
* proposal deposit
  * `100 uion` -> `500000 uion` (= 0.5 ION)
* minimum proposal deposit
  * `50 uion` -> `50000 uion` (= 0.05 ION)

We would like to request the community to kindly vote NO to Proposal #321, consider #322 as our proposal to instantiate ION DAO and cast your votes accordingly.

Vote **YES** on this proposal if you want to instantiate ION DAO contract on Osmosis with revised parameters.

"Signaling Proposal for ATOM/stATOM (#803) Incentivised Pool

- By voting **YES** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO matched incentives to the ATOM/stATOM (#803) pool on Osmosis.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO matched incentives to the ATOM/stATOM (#803) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to give matched OSMO incentives to ATOM/stATOM (#803). This pool falls into the “other” incentive category, which gets 2% of OSMO incentives. So the ATOM/stATOM pool would get part of that 2% of OSMO incentives.

The pool is externally incentivized with 375,000 STRD over 45 days. Matched incentives expire when current external incentives end. At that point, Stride will likely submit a new proposal for the stATOM/ATOM pool to be added to the set of pools that receive regular incentives.

After this signaling proposal has passed governance, this pool will begin the onboarding process.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations for a number of coming Osmosis applications, the most prominent of which being Mars Protocol.

"Osmosis v12 Oxygen Upgrade

## Osmosis v12 Oxygen Upgrade

This is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v12.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 6246000, which is estimated to occur on **Friday September 30th, UTC 16:00**. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.

## Upgrade Features
This upgrade adds the following features:

### TWAP

* Time weighted average prices for all AMM pools have been implemented. 
* These expose an on-chain oracle for each pool allowing CosmWasm apps to use this data.

### CosmWasm contract developer features

* Enables select queries for cosmwasm contracts.
* Adds message responses to gamm messages, to remove the neccessity of bindings.
* Allow specifying denom metadata from tokenfactory.
* Upgrade to wasmd v0.28.0

### Interchain Accounts Enabled

Allows accounts on another ICA enabled chain to carry out transactions on Osmosis and vice versa.

### Expedited Proposals

Allows governance to have proposals that execute in faster time windows given higher quorums (2/3rds).

[Full Change Log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/v12.x/CHANGELOG.md)

## Getting Prepared for the Upgrade

As always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.

If using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v12/bin/.

If not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v12.0.0 binary.


## Details of Upgrade Time

The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be **6246000**, anticipated to be on **Friday September 30th, UTC 16:00**. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown [here](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/6246000).

The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.",0.0039333538027689725

"Increase the Osmosis Active Validator Set to 150 Validators (from 135)

The Osmosis network is the home of the premier DEX in the IBC, and possibly the best DEX in the cryptocurrency space. Osmosis sees an impressive amount of daily traffic and serves as a central hub for investors to transfer assets between IBC networks. Because Osmosis is critically important to the IBC community, governance of the Osmosis network is extremely important. Even during the bear market, new investors continue to arrive. Representing diverse investors and their interests well as we are able aligns with the spirit of the IBC community.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to add STRD/OSMO (#806) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the STRD/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.

STRD/OSMO (#806) is currently incentivized with a significant amount of OSMO, which was added externally by the Stride Foundation. However, liquidity depth remains low. In the coming weeks, a large STRD airdrop will be released, including 1MM STRD to OSMO stakers. It is desirable for liquidity depth to increase to facilitate the expected uptick in trading volume.

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations for a number of coming Osmosis applications, the most prominent of which being Mars Protocol.

"Remove Incentives from OSMO/ROWAN (#629)

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for removing OSMO incentives from the OSMO/ROWAN pool (#629) on Osmosis.

* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in removing OSMO incentives from the OSMO/ROWAN pool (#629) on Osmosis.

## Details
This is an incentives adjustment proposal to remove all incentives from the Sifchain pool OSMO/ROWAN(#629) upon completion, as well as signalling removal from the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. 
The current OSMO APR is 69% and the Swap Fee APR is 53% a staggered exit is not planned.

## Justification
This proposal argues that ROWAN liquidity should remain entirely on Sifchain to facilitate their experimental tokenomics and so Osmosis should cease renting an alternative site of liquidity.

The most recent experiment is DEX Liquidity Protection which was implemented in the recent software upgrade on the 30th September. This mechanism allows only 2,000,000 net ROWAN to be sold every 24 hours, therefore increasing the stability of the ROWAN price on Sifchain. This cap was immediately hit and has led to a 4x price discrepancy between ROWAN on Sifchain and that transferred off.

This cap has effectively prevented a normal user from selling their ROWAN on Sifchain as the sale allowance per block is consumed by bots attempting to normalise the on and off-chain prices. If a user wishes to remove liquidity they must accept the loss regardless by exiting through other exchanges such as Osmosis.
Conversely, a user entering ROWAN may purchase on Osmosis and move to Sifchain where they make a theoretical instant 4x profit that is un-redeemable at that value.

This results in almost all volume passing through Osmosis. Continued incentivisation in the face of this increased volume as users accept their losses or chase an un-redeemable gain will cause a greater and greater share of Osmosis Liquidity Incentives to be allocated to the pool, the liquidity to increase further, and any ROWAN token disparity require more days of arbitrage sales to rectify.

"Implement A Minimum Gas Price of 0.0025 uOSMO on Osmosis

Vote YES on this proposal to signal that you support implementation of a minimum gas price of 0.0025 uOSMO on Osmosis at the protocol level.

Vote NO on this proposal to signal that you do not support implementation of a minimum gas price of 0.0025 uOSMO on Osmosis at the protocol level.

**Details**
Currently, Osmosis has no protocol-level minimum gas price. The reasoning for this is that the vast majority of OSMO liquidity is on Osmosis, making it difficult for new users to acquire elsewhere to carry out their first transaction. Allowing Osmosis users to submit transactions with a transaction fee of 0 has made it extremely easy for new users to onboard into Osmosis by enabling them to transact on Osmosis for the first time without having the native gas token. 

At the same time, however, setting a minimum gas price of 0 leaves Osmosis vulnerable to denial of service attacks executed via the spamming of free transactions on the network. While thankfully Osmosis has not experienced a major DoS or DDoS event to date, incidences of recurring transaction spam have been increasing.

With a recent upgrade, Keplr now offers Osmosis users the ability to pay transaction fees on Osmosis in non-OSMO assets (for example, gas can now be paid in ATOM). While the ability to do this has existed on the Osmosis chain for quite some time, this wallet upgrade has opened the door to a large number of onboarding routes into Osmosis for all users on the main front-end for the very first time. Similarly, Osmosis’s Binance listing has made it much easier for new users to purchase OSMO off-chain to use as a transaction fee if necessary.

As such, the time is ripe to implement a minimum transaction fee on Osmosis. The purpose of this proposal is to signal to Osmosis Labs and other key Osmosis development contributors that governance mandates a minimum gas price of 0.0025 uOSMO be implemented at the protocol level. There is currently no governance adjustable parameter to implement this fee, so this proposal will be implemented in a subsequent software upgrade.

Further, to the extent that fees need to be priced via the Transaction Fee Module in another asset, the transaction fee module should be amended to utilize Osmosis Time Weighted Average Pricing over at least a 24 hour period instead of the currently utilized spot pricing to ensure that validators are fairly compensated no matter which asset is used for fees

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/AXL

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/AXL (#812) pool on Osmosis.
* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/AXL (#812) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**
This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/AXL pool (#812). This pool is currently the 10th largest OSMO pool on Osmosis by Total Value Locked.This allows ~526 thousand OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the OSMO from the currently enabled pools.
Superfluid proposals ask whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance. While a relatively new chain, Osmosis already relies on the security of the Axelar chain to provide a large portion of TVL and so superfluid staking should be enabled.

"Update IBC Client for Cerberus

The Cerberus chain spent 1.5 weeks in halt due to the upcoming Dragonberry patch. Due to this halt, the IBC channel is currently in a frozen state. 

 # Halt timing 
 This issue was addressed by halting the chain and implementing further versions of the Cosmos SDK in Cerberus Testnet. Due to an unexpected further halt on  the testnet, Cerberus restart was planned based on the original dragonberry patch (v2.0.1: https://github.com/cerberus-zone/cerberus).

By voting **YES**, OSMO stakers signal their support for a 12 month renewal of the Osmosis Grants Program with Reverie continuing as Grants Lead.

By voting **NO**, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for a 12 month renewal of the Osmosis Grants Program.

The Osmosis Grants Program (OGP) has been active for 6 months, and is now looking to renew for an additional 12 months with some changes to the program. The details are outlined below.

**Details**

- The OGP will continue its core objective of issuing grants to contributors that can deliver long-term value to Osmosis.

- The OGP will add to this objective the incubation of new subDAOs and Strategic Initiatives to tackle protocol functions.

- Reverie will continue to serve as Grants Lead and is requesting 55,000 USDC and 25,000 OSMO per month in renewed compensation.

- Reverie will add more transparency through monthly reporting, calls, and other frequent reports.

- Jeremy Parish and Monetsupply will be added as two new signers on the OGP multi-sig.

As part of this proposal, the community will have an option to terminate Reverie’s involvement with the OGP after 6 months.

"Further Reduction of Liquidity Emissions

* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates approval that a further 21% of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives should be redirected to the community pool to lower direct Osmosis inflation until governance returns it.

* Voting No for this proposal indicates that 29% shall continue to be the proportion of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives that are redirected to the community pool.

## Background
Osmosis emits a fixed amount of OSMO per day as inflation, which decreases with each thirdening event. 
45% of this inflation is allocated to Liquidity Incentives and 71% of that is distributed between liquidity providers according to the incentives system resulting in a current emission of 174,978 OSMO per day to pay for liquidity.
The remaining 29% is redirected to the community pool to be used for future liquidity incentives when emissions have decreased and the broader market supports higher inflationary APR as a method of attracting new liquidity providers.

## State of Token Liquidity Growth
Osmosis has seen a steady growth of token liquidity over the last 6 months, particularly in the OSMO/Major and OSMO/Stable pools that receive the majority of liquidity incentive allocations.

As was observed in [Proposal 268](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/268), liquidity pools tend to grow when the incentives provided are greater than that of independently staking the two halves of the pool, plus a small additional yield that compensates for Impermanent Loss.
Notable examples of this include:
* Evmos [where the liquidity drastically increased after external incentives (22nd July) helped compensate for the higher Evmos Staking APR](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/f1c3a9f2-4678-48cf-92a4-8630b60f812e.1668440485580)
* Juno [where liquidity stagnated until 24th October when the Juno Halvening made Liquidity Provision a better choice again](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/694ebc77-5ba9-4868-81f2-dfa967d1cfde.1668440516112)

For completeness, other major pools over the last six months include:
* [WBTC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bd34d3de-1ad0-4fbb-b07d-063ecc9c5bf6.1667579137376)
* [WETH](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/9560938f-bb15-49de-90e1-06b5e750c29a.1667579147574)
* [CRO](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/d4bd737e-8b30-4db7-af30-6cbc6e4b1469.1667579157107)
* [DOT](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0a2d7495-c5d1-41d7-9fdd-41be3e6b73cc.1667579166070)
These all have steadily increased whilst being allocated high incentives.

Stables seem to act differently, potentially as during the current bear market they may be seen to have poor potential. Liquidity has been relatively stable despite even higher APRs than more volatile assets.
* [USDC](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/020d210a-a6cc-4fb7-a913-5d8dfcdee0b5.1667579081646)
* [DAI](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/94508d2e-2843-4cc1-8dff-70e3b63c1d1a.1667579097207)
* [EEUR](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/0cdadc1f-b809-461d-bd3b-a18de0098ce8.1667579109574)

Currently, the state of the top 95% of OSMO paired Liquidity pools based on the reward for Liquidity provision vs the Staking reward (or Osmosis Staking if no alternative) is as below:
[Liquidity Reward vs Staking Equivalent](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1d1ed978-9eaa-4c61-8a28-c5b8de42c8ce.1668435510417)

## Proposed Reduction
This proposal asks that a further 21% of Liquidity Incentives be redirected to the Community Pool at a rate of 7% a week, a change of 29% to 50%. This is an effective 30% reduction in current liquidity emissions.

While Osmosis' contribution to a pool's APR from Liquidity Incentives is reduced, APR gained from Swap Fees, External Incentives and Superfluid Staking will be unaffected. This results in smaller APR changes in pools with already lower APR as follows:
[APR Changes](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ea42ca02-ff4a-46e1-8a96-be95ed64c55f.1668435674138)
Jackal, stOSMO and Tori are cut off but have no changes as they are unincentivised by Osmosis at the time of writing.

This results in the following change to the Liquidity vs Staking chart, showing where pools are currently trending towards and where they would be trending towards after this reduction completes:
[Current Trending vs Trending after Reduction](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a9ce040b-047f-45dd-abed-fd951cb66202.1668435703320)

This shows that even with this reduction, LP rewards will remain superior to alternative token uses whilst reducing the amount that Osmosis pays each day to continue to maintain and grow token liquidity.

In order to ensure this reduction goes smoothly, an informal group will be formed to oversee each step change. This group consists of
* Chaos Labs (Incentives Optimisation Infrastructure)
* Flipside Flan (Flipside)
* Hathor Nodes (Validator & Incentives Optimisation Researcher)
* Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Labs)
* RedRabbit (Osmosis Community)

By a majority consensus, governance entrusts the five (5) member working group to use their best judgement to delay or halt the implementation of the second and or third 7% weekly redirection in order to ensure that this reduction in incentives does not negatively impact token liquidity. The working group DOES NOT have the ability to revert any redirections that have occurred or change the amount that is to be redirected so that it does not equal the 7% defined in this proposal. The working group will communicate to governance on Commonwealth on a weekly basis whether to expect the second and or third weekly redirection to be postponed due to any yet unforeseen extenuating circumstances.

"Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match

# Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match 

 * By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/IST (#837) on Osmosis.
 * By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/IST (#837) on Osmosis.

 We plan to introduce a proposal to match internal incentives for Pool 837 - OSMO/IST which is currently incentivized with 300,000 BLD over 60 days.

 Inter Protocol’s IST token launched on 10/27 with the launch of Agoric’s JavaScript platform.  After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST.  IST liquidity will be incentivized through the Cosmos ecosystem, with Osmosis being a critical early destination.

 The authors believe that it would be in the best interests of the community to incentivize an OSMO-IST pool to drive deep eventual liquidity and easy access from any other Osmosis token 

 Additionally, it is requested that IST be enabled and listed as an asset on app.osmosis.zone. The OSMO/IST pool should be listed as well in the main app.

 ## What is IST?

 IST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric’s unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric’s model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.

 For its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST.  Each PSM accepts another Cosmos stablecoin and mints IST in exchange.  There are currently four PSM contracts running, accepting USDC and USDT over both Axelar and Gravity bridges, each with different minting limits.  Rationale for the current minting limits was explained by the elected governance committee here: https://community.agoric.com/t/ist-minting-limits-for-inter-protocol-mvp-launch/87/1 

 Additional PSMs may be added by governance to accept new IBC-accessible stablecoins. 
]
 IST’s next iteration will include overcollateralized vaults, which will drive a major unlock for minting capability and allow the token to diversify away from bridge risk and stablecoin centralization risk.

"Signaling Proposal for stOSMO/OSMO (#833) Incentivised Pool

- By voting **YES** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their support for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.

**Details**

This is a signaling proposal to add stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the stOSMO/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.

stOSMO/OSMO (#833) is currently incentivized with STRD from the Stride Foundation, at a rate of 10,000 STRD per day. The Stride Foundation will continue incentivizing this pool for the foreseeable future.

If approved, OSMO incentives to the stOSMO pool would increase liquidity depth, allowing the pool to function as a stable oracle for the price of stOSMO and absorb stOSMO liquidations. If liquidity is deep enough, stOSMO will likely be a collateral option for these coming Osmosis applications: Mars, Membrane, Margined, and Levana. In addition, many applications throughout the Cosmos will likely use stOSMO as collateral - if the stOSMO pool is deep enough.

**About Stride**

Stride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride has a huge emphasis on security, with a minimalist blockchain, rate limiting, and continual auditing. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations. As Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis, it makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the stOSMO pool to the set of incentivized pools.

"Osmosis v13 Fluorine upgrade proposal

This is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v13.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height [7241500](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/7241500), which is estimated to occur on Thursday December 8th, UTC 15:00. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.

## Upgrade Features

This upgrade adds the following features:

### [Stableswap Pools](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/gamm/pool-models/stableswap/README.md)

* Stableswap pools offer low slippage for two assets that are intended to be tightly correlated.
* There is a price ratio they are expected to be at, and the AMM offers low slippage around this price.

### [IBC Rate Limiting](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/ibc-rate-limit/README.md)

* Governance may define how much value can flow in and out of the chain for a specific denom, channel, and time period.
* Increases the level of security for assets on Osmosis in the event of any security issues on Osmosis, the counter-party chain, or within IBC itself.

### [Cross-chain Cosmwasm contracts](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/v13.0.0/x/ibc-hooks#ibc-hooks)

* IBC has been upgraded to v3.4.0 which allows metadata to be passed as part of the message.
* Enables use cases such as cross chain swaps.

### Force Unlock

* Governance may specify addresses to permit instantly unlocking bonded liquidity.
* Enables uses such as the liquidation of bonded pools when used for collateral.

### Multi-hop OSMO discount

* When a trade consists of just two OSMO pools during a single transaction, the swap fees are automatically halved.
* For further details see Proposal 187 when this was initially signalled for development.


## Getting Prepared for the Upgrade

As always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.

If using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v13/bin/.

If not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v13.0.0 binary.

## Details of Upgrade Time

The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be [7241500](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/7241500), anticipated to be on Thursday December 8th, UTC 15:00. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown here.

The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.

Proposal Type: Proposal to spend funds from the community pool

A total of 16,572 $ION (78% of the total $ION supply) has been approved to be eventually transferred from the Community Pool to the ION DAO Treasury with the passing of the signaling proposal (#120). To ensure the safety of $ION, we suggest first transferring 33% (5,468 $ION) of the approved amount before systematically transferring the rest after this spend contract is proven safe and reliable.

## After transferring ION

The ION dev contributor team is currently developing a treasury information UI for the ION DAO website, via which ION DAO members can access to information and updates such as Treasury spending. The ION DAO governance will decide all fund uses with a smart contract code.

"Phase out Incentives on Low Revenue Pools

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for a staged removal of OSMO incentives from the listed pools.

* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to a staged removal of OSMO incentives from the listed pools

## Details
This proposal asks that Osmosis incentives on under-utilised pools be removed to align the Minor/OSMO category to pools that are strategically important to Osmosis to acquire liquidity of but do not meet the requirements to have Major/OSMO.

This proposal includes the lowest nine Minor pools by fees generated, totalling around 0.08% of incentive emissions as well as the lowest three  Other category pools.

Any matched incentives would not be removed by this proposal as these are a way for projects to split the cost of liquidity beyond that sustained by swap fees or provided by the team.

### Proposed pools
Incentives on the following pools will be removed entirely at the next regular incentive proposal
* 549 EEUR/JUNO
* [637 OSMO/DARC](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/637)

Incentives on the following pools will be removed over two weeks at regular incentive proposals as follows:
Week 1 - 50%
Week 2 - 0%

* [557 OSMO/IXO](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/557)
* [621 OSMO/DIG](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/621)
* [553 OSMO/LIKE](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/553)
* [461 EEUR/NGM](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/461)
* [613 OSMO/VDL](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/613)

* [571 OSMO/BCNA](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/571)
* [6 ATOM/DVPN](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/6)

As this is a bundle proposal, please vote no if you do not approve of any of these pools being removed and a smaller set will be proposed.

"Stableswap Incentive structure

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in modifying the incentives structure as below to facilitate Stableswap pools.

* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in modifying the incentives structure as below to facilitate Stableswap pools.

### About StableSwap
Stableswaps are pools that offer low slippage for two assets that are intended to be tightly correlated. There is a price ratio they are expected to be at, and the AMM offers low slippage around this price.
Stableswaps are the most popular pools across DeFi, providing deep liquidity in an ecosystem with no impermanent loss and sustainable yield from maintaining the peg between the two assets.
These are therefore important for Osmosis to implement and will be implemented in v13.

### Incentives Category
A new incentives category is proposed: *Stable/Stable* 
This category would include pools consisting of two, or more tokens which have been authorised as Stable assets and are pegged to the same currency.
i.e. EEUR/USDC would not be not a qualifying pool

### Incentives Allocation
Shares of incentives are currently allocated to each category up to its cap.
Stableswap pools are strategically important to Osmosis' growth, as can be seen from the dominant pairs on alternative exchanges, and so the allocation of incentives should be higher than typical for a non-OSMO pool.

With multiple new dollar stablecoins emerging recently and pending, allocating a fixed % of incentives to the category will hugely benefit those with existing liquidity to draw on, and penalise those taking a more measured approach to slowly build their market-cap, encouraging excessive levels of risk taking.

To incentivise these pools this proposal puts forward a new set of rules for the Stable/Stable category only.

* The Stable/Stable category shall be allocated a maximum share of 4% of LP emissions.
    * Any unused incentive allocation will be proportionately shared between alternative categories rather than being normalised into Stable/Stable.
* Pools will be automatically accepted for the external incentive matching program based on the following criteria:
    * Using the Stableswap curve.
    * Less than or equal to 0.05% fees.
    * Composed entirely of governance-authorised Stablecoins, or GAMM derivatives of other pools meeting these criteria.
    * All assets are intended by their minting process to be at minimum soft-pegged to the same denomination.
    * Receiving external incentives, 
        * of at least 100 OSMO in equivalent value per day.
        * for an epoch length of at least 7 around the date of OSMO incentive allocation.
* Pools receiving native incentives must meet the following criteria:
    * Using the Stableswap curve.
    * Less than or equal to 0.05% fees.
    * Composed of two or more governance-authorised Stablecoins.
    * All assets are intended by their minting process to be at minimum soft-pegged to the same denomination.
    * Passed by Governance as a core stableswap pool.
    * This proposal recommends that the number of core stableswap pools is kept low to prevent duplication of liquidity locations but allows for multiple to exist.
* Stable/Stable pools will have no maturity rating.
    * Incentive matching changes will therefore follow at a lag of 5-12 days depending on the time of addition/removal compared to the routine incentives proposal.
    * This allows Osmosis incentives to adapt to external incentive and volume changes as rapidly as possible.
* Incentives will be allocated as a fee subsidy in line with the current model, however as there is no normalisation this will be a direct value matching until the cap is reached.
    * Pools with external incentives auto-matching will receive a target allocation of $1 to $1 in external incentives, capped at $1 per $1 fees generated.
    * The Pool with native incentives will receive a target allocation of $2 per $1 generated and cease to have any external incentives matched while receiving native incentives.

"Upload ICNS Contracts: Name-nft Contract, Part 1

## Description
By voting **YES** on this proposal, you will signal that you **approve** of uploading the NameNFT contract of Interchain Name Service (ICNS) to Osmosis chain.
 By voting **NO** on this proposal, you will signal that you **disapprove** of uploading the contract to Osmosis chain in its current form.
## **Details**
ICNS aims to provide a fair, readily adoptable naming protocol for any chain connected with IBC. It is chain-agnostic, supporting all Cosmos SDK-based and IBC-enabled chains that have registered their bech32 prefixes on the [SLIP-173 repo](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0173.md). 

The ICNS protocol will be implemented by three different contracts: NameNFT, Resolver, and Registrar. As users will be able to claim their ICNS names by verifying their Twitter handles in its bootstrapping phase, these contracts will be in charge of verifying Twitter OAuth, minting NFT for the given user name, and keeping the list of addresses for each bech32 prefix.

**All name resolutions will take place on the Osmosis blockchain initially**, but it is expected that ICNS will switch to using an outpost model that allows each chain’s name resolution to happen locally by deploying address resolution contracts on other CosmWasm-enabled blockchains. 

Please also note that there will be a multisig admin account(s) that is collectively owned by the initial committee of builders including Chainapsis, Cosmostation, Commonwealth, and Skiff, and it will be in charge of managing the three contracts of ICNS and adding/removing operators of Twitter OAuth verification. 

**This proposal would approve the deployment of NameNFT Contract, which is in charge of minting the NFT for the given user name and managing the ownership of the NFT**. The admin account(s) will also be managed by this contract.

"Remove Non-OSMO pool incentives

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for a staged removal of OSMO incentives from pools within the OTHERS and MAJOR/STABLE categories and subsequent abolishment of these categories.

* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to a staged removal of OSMO incentives from pools within the OTHERS and MAJOR/STABLE categories and subsequent abolishment of these categories.

**Details**
With the addition of the [Osmosis Multihop](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/187) in [v13](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/370), OSMO pools are now the preferred route with the lowest cost in the majority of trades. While non-OSMO pools will still yield profit for LPers from arbitrage trades, they are no longer required in order to give the lowest trade costs for users.

This proposal argues that Osmosis incentives to pools in the OTHERS and MAJOR/STABLE categories are now no longer required by Osmosis and therefore these categories should be removed from the incentives system. 

The MAJOR/STABLE category currently receives no incentives, however a pool (482) never had incentives individually removed by governance and so has been decreasing according to the scaling cap weekly. 

**Affected Pools**

If this proposal passes, incentives on the following pools will be removed over two weeks at regular incentive proposals as follows:
Week 1 - 50%
Week 2 - 0%

Incentives on the following pools will be removed entirely at the next regular incentive proposal:
* [482 EEUR\ATOM](https://info.osmosis.zone/pool/482)

Total Emissions: 0.000015%

Any matched incentives are also removed by this proposal, the only active of which is ATOM/STARS which was unintentionally proposed for matching according to the Commonwealth discussion [here](https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/8303-signaling-proposal-for-starsosmo-external-incentive-match).

"Reduce incentives on established Major and Stable category pools

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for a staged reduction of emitted OSMO incentives to the Major/OSMO and Stable/OSMO to defer inflation as outlined below.

* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to a staged reduction of emitted OSMO incentives to the Major/OSMO and Stable/OSMO to defer inflation as outlined below.

## Details
Previous incentive reduction proposals have reduced the emitted quantity of OSMO to all pools. [Proposal 364](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/364) put this staged reduction in to the hands of a working group who have continued to reduce emissions down to 50% of standard. This was carried out slowly as the required hurdle rate of pools adjusts with market and liquidity changes. Several of these pools, notably the WETH, WBTC, CRO, USDC and DAI pools have had high incentives compared to their hurdle rate and have never been a factor in choosing whether to proceed with the reduction due to being excessively incentivised compared to comparable rates.

Monitoring the OSMO/MAJOR and OSMO/STABLE pool GAMM levels shows that very few liquidity providers have left these pools, however new liquidity providers are not being attracted. Meanwhile, the high inflation of Osmosis is causing token value to be diluted resulting in impermanent loss in all pools as can be seen by the paired tokens in the pools decreasing faster than the GAMM tokens representing liquidity provided.

This proposal aims to set the incentive rate for all established Major and Stable pools to be approximately the comparable staking rate of each half of the pools, or the OSMO staking APR, plus a 5% premium to account for impermanent loss, at the current liquidity levels.

This aims to be a preliminary step to reduce inflation of the OSMO token until target liquidity levels can be set and further measures to reduce overall inflation can be implemented.

This results in only significant changes to the OSMO/MAJOR and OSMO/STABLE categories with the following estimated effect on APR:
[APR Chart](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/d95dee12-403f-4607-88f5-bbcfdd494038.1671358004731)

Which compares to the comparable staking rate as follows:
[Comparable Rates](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/04c3dc33-8ae0-45ab-8c64-1cc82cdb25af.1671358014300)

## Current allocations
Community pool share of OSMO LP Incentives: **50%**
Leaving 50% emitted to Liquidity Providers - **123,288 OSMO/day**

**Current category shares**
* 45% OSMO/MAJOR - 60,966 OSMO/day
* 30% OSMO/STABLE - 40,644 OSMO/day
* 14% OSMO/MINOR - 18,967 OSMO/day
* 2% OTHERS - 2,710 OSMO/day
* Up to 4% Stable/Stable

These are further normalised to 100%

**Current Minimums**
* 9 OSMO/CRO: 3%
* 704 OSMO/WETH: 10%
* 712 OSMO/WBTC: 10%
* 773 OSMO/DOT: 0.5%
* 789 OSMO/MATIC: 0.5% with 4 week sunset

**Current Maximum**
* 1 OSMO/ATOM: 25%

## Proposed Allocations
Community pool share of OSMO LP Incentives: **70%**
Leaving 30% emitted to Liquidity Providers - **73,973 OSMO/day**

**Proposed category shares**
These are normalised to 100% if the Stable/Stable allocation is not used:
* 54% OSMO/MAJOR - 39,945 OSMO/day (-21,021, or -34%)
* 17% OSMO/STABLE - 12,575 OSMO/day (-28,069 or -69%)
* 25% OSMO/MINOR - 18,493 OSMO/day (-474 or -2.5%)
* Up to 4% Stable/Stable

The OTHERS Category is being voted on removal in [Proposal 389](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/389). If this proposal was to be rejected then the 2% allocation would retain the OSMO proportionately according to the category shares. However, this change is modelled with that proposal succeeding.

**Proposed Minimums:**
* 1 OSMO/ATOM: Removed
* 9 OSMO/CRO: Reduced to 2%.
* 481 OSMO/EEUR: 0.5% added.
* 674 OSMO/DAI: 3.5% added.
* 704 OSMO/WETH: 10% maintained.
* 712 OSMO/WBTC: Reduced to 8.5%.
* 773 OSMO/DOT: 0.5% maintained.
* 789 OSMO/MATIC: 0.5% with existing sunset period from [Proposal 386](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/386)

**Proposed Maximums**
* 1 OSMO/ATOM Increase to 35%
* 678 OSMO/USDC Addition of 13%

## Implementation
This proposal is an incentive adjustment proposal with the listed new Minimums, an increase in the Maximum for Pool 1 to 30%, an increase of the Community Pool Share of incentives to 60% and the ratio of category changes halfway implemented.

The second increase of the community pool, final category rebalances and the other changes to Maximums would be implemented in the routine incentive proposal dated the 26th December 2022, taking effect on the epoch of the 1st January 2023.

"Help the Community Understand how only they can save Luna Classic

I hear lots of calls from new members to have a token burn. I do not think most understand how the algorithm works, so I think we need to help spread the message on how the community is the only ones that are able to return value to LUNA Classic. If you want LUNA burnt, you need to SWAP LUNA for UST. This will automatically burn LUNA and help return UST to peg price. An added bonus: with the allocations proposed in Do Kwons fork proposal, UST holders get the best deal on air drops for the new coin. You will pay an average of $4 per air drop coin based on current UST price. With the current LUNA price you only get 1 coin for every $13 worth of LUNA you hold. In addition, you get to keep your coins on the LUNA Classic chain, and if enough people swap LUNA for UST, you are bringing UST back up to peg and increasing the value of LUNA as it burns. Only the community has the ability to save LUNA Classic, there is nothing Do Kwon or the team has the ability to do at this point in the game other than plan the fork.

"Proposal to the Luna Community By The Guy Who Forked Ethereum

After analyzing the blockchain, it appears that some transactions should be explained by the LFG, for the sake of transparency for the community and investors.

First of all, the transfer of 25012 BTC on May 9, 2022, with a value of 842 million USD. Then a series of transfers on May 9, 2022, totaling 70752 BTC and valued at 2,380 billion USD.

Given the off-chain nature of these transactions and their amount, we strongly recommend the LFG to communicate their purpose and intent.

We would suggest LFG publish in detail the actions that have been taken to maintain the UST peg, as well as the reports of the transactions that have been made on the exchanges. Given the circumstances and the amount involved, the highest level of transparency is required for the sake of the project and its community.

"Special request (UST 2.0)

Please stop talking about this damn fork. Recover the UST with the new UST 2.0 version, fully backed by gold, dollar and BTC.
As indicated.

Gold Benefits: Best profitability in history against any currency, we have PAXG and BTG available if you don't want to keep physical gold. But make contracts with companies that have real ballast. Another benefit is liquidity, it is a commodity accepted even in the other world, according to the pharaohs' belief... Lol.
Benefits of BTC: Future store of value for the next 150 years, but for now it suffers a lot of manipulation by the retards.

So, we would look like this: UST 2.0 and keep the current structure.
UST 2.0 Composition:
1) GLUNA (60%) Dollar (30%) BTC (10% when it has more value, can be used with greater weight in the UST currency basket)
2) This dollar must be fully audited, having its total at 1:10. In other words, we would have 10% guarantee for each UST 2.0

I hope I have helped and I believe that this is a good way.

no veto I’d like to burn it or have it be heard ❤️




From following everything 
Lunc is great shape and health even with all news circulating
Ustc will continue to work towards $1 on its own and supporting and holding I think is necessary




Would it be possible to implement a system to limit shorts? In general if this was my baby that I built i wouldn’t appreciate it but I total understand it’s necessary 




This is something the lunc token would inherit using burnt coins of some new mechanic, new wallet that would be used on daily case randomly to create some randomness but only once every 24 hour period. So technically when the mechanic hit at 1st 11:59pm  and then again at 2nd 12:01 am then mechanic would hit between 3rd 12:01am-11:59pm - with accumulation technically from the 2d 12:02am -11:59pm adding to the 3rds amount because it’s just waiting for the programming to work but hey big one coming up




The mechanic would use some grid funds or some of tax maybe a combination of both, but I know digging into the tax is unliked but I think it’s worth the idea. not a lot could start of minimal and then experimented with on random days 




At the end of the day all assets will still be burnt, a buying bot but griding first before burning, token sent to this wallet will get put into a grid to stabilize price and each tax would cover a different area(would only burn once the price returns the original entry price or higher, if lower it becomes a holding bot, the lender is the station in house to increase network usage constantly

"Expanded & Finalized L1 Task Force [v3] (Q2, 2023)

To fill the senior leadership gap left by the departure of Prof. Ed Kim and the removal of Mr. Tobias Andersen, we propose bringing in Bilbo Baggins (senior software engineer/architect) and Solid Snake (another senior engineer and systems architect), both of whom will serve as team co-leads. In addition to them, we propose adding another 3 senior developers to the team (NotJoshC, MangoChutney, ChopstickSensei) all of whom are seasoned developers with years of experience under their belts, and will have no trouble fitting into the group. Finally, we propose adding Jacob Gadikian (senior developer and CEO of Notional Labs) to this roster as a retainer, for the purpose of external collaboration and high-level overview (code review and Cosmos-specific implementation), as Jacob has already contributed much to the blockchain and his expertise will prove invaluable in helping us reach parity.

We need to scale up our L1 team if we are to prepare LUNC for the coming bull run!

Ergo, here is the proposed budget for Q2:

$7,500/month for Bilbo Baggins x 3 months = $22,500 overall for Q2
$7,500/month for SolidSnake x 3 months = $22,500 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for NotJoshC x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for MangoChutney x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for ChopstickSensei x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for Jacob Gadikian x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2

Total expenditure for Q2: $105,000, paid out in 2 installments!
(or 853,658,536.585365 LUNC at a conversion rate of 0.000123)

This money is to be paid out in 2 equal installments! If this proposal passes, the first installment would be released immediately upon the proposal’s passing so the work can commence. The second installment would be put up for a vote in its own prop after 8 weeks have passed, to allow the community to judge the work delivered over 2 months. This ensures the community pool is protected from a one-time drain, as well as incentivizes the developers with delayed payouts for completing their roadmap!

This is a signaling proposal to include the Arbitrum pool ARB/OSMO (#1011) into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives.

After this proposal has passed governance, pool #1011 will be added to the regular incentives program of Osmosis.

## About Arbitrum
Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2, optimistic rollup. As an Ethereum scaling protocol, it makes transactions significantly faster and cheaper. The team at Offchain Labs launched the flagship chain, Arbitrum One, in May of 2021, and the Arbitrum ecosystem has quickly become a hub for DeFi.

"Add ARB to the list of Major category assets

This proposal would add ARB to the list of assets that Osmosis recognises as strategically important for growth, increasing the incentives allocated to it.

## Details
ARB is currently the rank 40 cryptocurrency by market cap with a valuation of around $1.4 Billion, 3.5 times higher than Osmosis. The majority of ARB trade volume happens on alternative decentralized exchanges and on centralized exchanges such as Binance, not on Osmosis.

According to DefiLlama, the aggregate TVL of Arbitrum protocols is around $2.35 Billion, making it the 4th largest hub for DeFi activity. Ethereum DeFi “blue chips” such as Aave and Uniswap have deployed their respective protocols on Arbitrum, and decentralized perpetuals exchange GMX alone has generated over $100 Million in cumulative fees from margin and trading activity.

A recent clustering analysis by Flipside Crypto uncovered a moderate degree of overlap (as measured by co-occurance) between users of Arbitrum One, Polygon and BNB Chain - where Osmosis has already found reasonable success attracting liquidity from. To date, the Axelar bridge has facilitated over 618,000 WMATIC and 3,000 WBNB in transfers to Osmosis from their respective source chains. Further analysis of bridge activity shows that Arbitrum <> Osmosis  is a growing source of USDC volume for Squid Router.

This proposal asks if Osmosis has a strategic interest in attracting more liquidity of ARB and so will enable it to access a greater proportion of liquidity incentives.

## About Arbitrum
Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2, optimistic rollup. As an Ethereum scaling protocol, it makes transactions significantly faster and cheaper. The team at Offchain Labs launched the flagship chain, Arbitrum One, in May of 2021, and the Arbitrum ecosystem has quickly become a hub for DeFi. A separate AnyTrust chain, Arbitrum Nova was introduced in July of 2022 which is optimized for low-cost transactions.

"Allow IBCX Contracts to be Uploaded

This is a proposal to allow the address osmo14n3a65fnqz9jve85l23al6m3pjugf0atvrfqh5 to upload contracts relating to the IBCX project. If passed, IBCX, a Cosmos Index token, will be launched on Osmosis.

## Context
The contract audit was completed by Oak Security on May 2nd and IBCX, built by the ION DAO dev contributors and the ION DAO, is about to be released. 
* IBCX held the first beta test last December, resulting in meaningful outcomes. 

Let us briefly list the data of the beta test. 
* Number of registered wallet addresses: 7,919
* Number of connected wallet addresses: 3,125
* Number of unique wallets that minted or burned IBCX: 1,134 
* The total amount of minted $IBCX: 27,207.75 (about 2,720,750 testnet OSMO)
* Number of feedback reports received: 720

Besides the first beta test, the IBCX has been recruiting testers to proceed with the final test before the main launch. 
[https://twitter.com/IBCindex/status/1653399146299277312?s=20](https://twitter.com/IBCindex/status/1653399146299277312?s=20)

Now, the ION DAO dev contributors and ION DAO are ready to ship the product in May. 
This proposal aims to deploy contract codes for the minting, burning, and rebalancing of IBCX. 

The user stories for Mint/Burn/Rebalancing will be the following: 
Mint Contract: Users can mint IBCX through the Swap contract by utilizing their ATOM, OSMO, USDC, etc. 
Burn Contract: Users can burn the IBCX they own through the Osmosis swap contract and acquire assets such as ATOM/OSMO/USDC. 
Rebalancing Contract: Users can vote on quarterly portfolio rebalancing on ION DAO (ion.wtf) every 3 months. This contract will enable the IBCX portfolio to be automatically rebalanced upon the ION DAO on-chain governance result. 
By deploying these contracts, ION DAO dev contributors will be able to release IBCX on Osmosis, and users will be able to utilize the Mint, Burn, and Rebalancing features on [https://index.ion.wtf](https://index.ion.wtf). 
# About IBCX 
IBCX is a Cosmos index token that’s designed to benchmark the leading Cosmos tokens’ performances. It aims to achieve this by procuring and maintaining those tokens as its collateral. IBCX price is dynamically calculated based on the spot prices of its selected components, or the collateralized Cosmos tokens. The weight % of each token is determined and periodically rebalanced based on the ION DAO’s governance voting results. ION is a native token of Osmosis, and ION DAO plans to fully utilize the liquidity of Cosmos’s #1 AMM to ensure the successful operation of IBCX. 

Osmosis’s ION DAO governs IBCX, and it aims to provide new opportunities to the Cosmos Ecosystem. 
## Operation: Rebalancing 
IBCX aims to represent the fundamental values of the Cosmos ecosystem. Therefore, it's imperative to keep its portfolio updated and as a **best representation** of Cosmos. The initial portfolio should and will change accordingly, and we'll call this process portfolio rebalancing. ION DAO will be responsible for this process after IBCX launches. 

We explained above that the token quantities in a unit of IBCX are held constant to ensure the fungibility of the index token. 

Therefore, ION DAO proposals on IBCX rebalancing will change the quantities, whether adding, reducing, or completely removing. 

After the passing of each rebalancing proposal, the rebalancing logic will perform swaps of the portfolio tokens on Osmosis to match the newly decided weight %s. The dev contributor team will propose viable solutions to avoid a significant impact on the token prices deriving from large trades, such as maintaining specific intervals between the swaps. 

ION holders essentially decide the future of IBCX by directly participating in the portfolio rebalancing process via ION DAO. ION holders will be able to vote on ongoing proposals and propose new rebalancing ideas of their own. We wish and expect to see a vibrant community of Cosmonauts collaborating and freely debating on ION DAO to decide the assets that best represent the Cosmos and the future of interchain. 

## How Does the Rebalancing Work?
Rebalancing is the most crucial part of IBCX’s operation. Thus, anyone from ION DAO will be able to upload a rebalancing proposal besides the ION DAO dev contributors. 

After the rebalancing proposal is passed, the rebalancing contract will automatically swap underlying assets according to the newly determined portfolio. 

## Rebalancing Process
The IBCX portfolio will be adjusted based on ION DAO on-chain governance results every three months. Please refer to the rebalancing process below. 
* ION DAO dev contributors will remind of the upcoming rebalancing date 15 days in advance before the next rebalancing. 
* ION DAO dev contributors and anyone can create a Commonwealth thread to discuss the next rebalancing details during the 15 days. 
  * Commonwealth thread will be mainly used to have conversations regarding each rebalancing. 
  * The thread will contain the portfolio at the moment. You are welcome to join and drop comments. 
* On the rebalancing date (after 15 days from the initial announcement), ION DAO dev contributors will make on-chain governance, including on-chain messages to run the rebalancing. 
  * We assume that the ION DAO dev contributors will usually do it, but anyone can also upload an on-chain proposal if they want. 
* If passed, the IBCX contract will automatically swap underlying assets according to the newly determined portfolio. 
* Assuming that the first portfolio was 50% ATOM, 40% OSMO, and 10% ION 
* If the rebalancing proposal suggesting to change the portfolio to 50% ATOM, 50% OSMO, and 0% ION, the contract will swap ION to OSMO to equalize the ratio. 
* The next rebalancing date will be set up three months after the end of each rebalancing. 
* If it’s not passed, ION DAO dev contributors will upload a modified proposal again based on community feedback. Each rebalancing could be skipped if ION DAO does not want to execute it at the moment. 

## Details 

* Rebalancing Cycle: Rebalancing should be reviewed by ION DAO governance at least every quarter. 
* Rebalancing Period: It depends on market conditions. We expect it will take up to 14 days to complete each rebalancing as each step is designed to minimise the slippage for the overall rebalance. 
* Please note that you can’t both mint and burn during the rebalancing period. Instead, you have to trade on [https://app.osmosis.zone/](https://app.osmosis.zone/). 
* The service provider should announce each rebalancing date 15 days in advance at least. 
* All details regarding the execution of each rebalancing of the IBCX portfolio depend on ION DAO on-chain governance result. Please note that the rebalancing schedule could be changed based on the ION DAO governance status. 
* Rebalancing the IBCX portfolio could be executed immediately (some steps could be skipped) due to requests from the ION DAO community and fluctuations in the market, even if there are remaining dates until the next rebalancing. ION DAO will confirm the details in those cases as well. 

## Operation: Fees
The dev contributor team will continue to be responsible for leading the operation of IBCX. We propose to charge an annual Management Fee of 0.55% on the total quantities of the collateral tokens to cover the operating costs. A IBCX smart contract will incur this fee on every block and allocate 30% for the operation costs and the rest (70%) to the ION Treasury. 

In addition, we propose imposing another fee of 0.15% on the burning of IBCX. This fee is to be used as a safeguard to protect the IBCX price from sudden sell pressure in the market. We emphasize that there will be no extra fees for selling IBCX on any of the IBCX pools available on Osmosis. Like the Management Fee, 30% of the incurred Burn Fee will be allocated for the operation costs and 70% to the ION Treasury. 

The contract will send the all collected fees to the [ION DAO Treasury](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo1k8re7jwz6rnnwrktnejdwkwnncte7ek7gt29gvnl3sdrg9mtnqkse6nmqm) first. 

## Mint Fee
There will initially be no fee to mint IBCX. 

## Streaming Fee
 IBCX’s annual streaming fee is 0.55%. The streaming fee will be charged every second based on the fee rate and how long users hold IBCX. 

This means that users can only burn the amount of IBCX they have held minus the streaming fee. The streaming fee will be paid by every token in the IBCX portfolio. 

About a 0.55 fee will be charged as the streaming fee if you hold a 100 value of IBCX for 1 year. 

## Burn Fee
Burn fee will be charged at the moment users burn IBCX. They will pay the burn fee with IBCX before receiving OSMO (or USDC or ATOM). After that, they will receive OSMO (or USDC or ATOM) in IBCX equivalent minus that burn fee. The burn fee will be paid with IBCX.

"ARB Bootstrapping liquidity incentives

This proposal would add OSMO incentives directly to the ARB/OSMO pool (#1011) consisting of 0.5% of liquidity incentives and maintain this for a period of 4 routine incentive proposals.

## Details
This proposal would provide initial incentives on the 16th of May by actioning the following:
* Directly allocating 0.5% of incentives to the ARB/OSMO pool (#1011)
* Set Minimum incentives for the ARB/OSMO (#1011) pool of 0.5% for 4 routine proposals to retain this level of liquidity incentives while liquidity is built.

Bootstrapping incentives indicate that Osmosis stakers wish to quickly establish functional liquidity of ARB to facilitate trading and liquidity flow between Arbitrum and Osmosis via the Axelar bridge.

"Upload Pyth contract

Passing this proposal will upload the Pyth core contract to the Osmosis chain. 

## Details
Pyth Network is an oracle that publishes financial market data to multiple blockchains. The data is sourced from over 80 first-party data providers, including some of the largest exchanges and market making firms worldwide. Pyth provides real-time price feeds — updating once per second — for 200+ assets including crypto, equities, FX and more. 

The Pyth contract allows applications on Osmosis to consume Pyth prices. Pyth is using a pull update mechanism where the network generates a stream of signed price updates, and anyone can pull those updates on-chain when they need them. The Pyth contract facilitates this process: it verifies price updates (for a minimal fee) and allows other programs to read the current price. 

The contract is controlled by Pyth governance via Wormhole. The contract will be its own owner, but can accept Wormhole messages from Pyth governance to set configuration parameters. Pyth is currently governed by a multisig of members of the Pyth Data Association. 

Pyth uses Wormhole to verify incoming governance or price feed update messages. It needs a wormhole contract to be deployed on chain. Since Wormhole is not on Osmosis currently, we will also be deploying the core wormhole contract that will be used for read-only purposes. The contract will be its own owner, but can accept messages from Wormhole governance to set configuration parameters.

"Suitdrop Commonwealth Proposal

## ""Suitdrop"" = spacesuit + merchdrop

### Definitions

The lower-case ""suitdrop"" is used generically to mean merchandise drops of anyone or any team that would want to use these primitives for their communities where each each physical item will have its own NFT associated with it. For there to be liquidity available to anyone who wants to purchase a physical merch, one primitive is the bonding curve.

The upper-case Suitdrop is used to refer to the brand.

### Proposal

This is a proposal from Interchain.FM to deploy two new primitives to the Osmosis mainnet:
1. The automation of minting/burning of tokens meant for physical merchandise redemption. Once a token is burned and a physical merch is redeemed, minter receives a NFT associated with the unique merch item.
2. A bonding curve that uses $OSMO as the base token to buy the redemption token in #1.

When composed together, what you get is an automated Unisocks mechanism implemented on a bonding curve. Once live, if this prop passes, the bonding curve will use the Cosmwasmpool spec #4810 by Boss Supanat Potiwarakorn to seamlessly integrate with the Osmosis frontend to give you the same great UX of the AMM that you’re familiar with.

Unisocks was a one-off experiment by Uniswap Labs. While they successfully proved the concept, they left an opportunity void by not taking the concept to its logical conclusion—designing a framework to allow anyone to implement it for any merch on its AMM. We think that this use case can lend to greater trading volume as well as provide a lower bound of demand for the Osmosis chain, positioned as the preferred AMM for suitdrops/unisocks of any appchain.

### Proposed roadmap

May 31—shirt signing period closes
June 1—airdrop snapshot taken
June 2—$SHIRT drop (minting starts, place shirt orders on [suitdrop.zone](http://www.suitdrop.zone/))
June 2—Bonding Curve Opens (the earlier the redemption, the more cost effective the shirt)
Future TBD (ETA: Q1/Q2 ‘24)—Suitdrop-as-a-Service

Now that you understand the value proposition for Osmosis and future users of this framework, here’s how Interchain.FM intends to leverage these contracts, once on-chain.

We intend to achieve two goals by implementing Suitdrop:
1. Prove the idea
2. Provide a playbook

Find the Suitdrop repository here: [(https://github.com/SuitDrop/cw-tokens/tree/v0.14.2/contracts/cw20-merkle-airdrop)](https://github.com/SuitDrop/cw-tokens/tree/v0.14.2/contracts/cw20-merkle-airdrop)

### Tokenomics

The first (of many) suitdrops will be a drop of a limited edition batch of exclusive Cosmos tees. Cosmos is a community-first ecosystem, and as such, you get to put your unique imprint on the tee. When you [#signtheshirt](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20am%20signing%20this%20shirt%20to%20show%20my%20support%20for%20the%20upcoming%20Shirtdrop%20on%20%40SuitdropZone!%0A%0ASign%20yours%20too%20over%20at%20https%3A%2F%2Fsuitdrop.zone%2F%20so%20your%20PFP%20can%20be%20added%20to%20the%20shirt!%0A%0AOsmocon%20Paris%20here%20we%20come!&url=https://twitter.com/SuitdropZone/status/undefined), your PFP is collected which will then get printed onto the physical tee. (Current shirt design displayed on [suitdrop.zone](http://www.suitdrop.zone/) is a sample placeholder and not the final design of the shirt.)

There will be 500 total $SHIRT tokens in existence, 100 of which will be available for free mints to the top 100 stakers who either 1) stake with Interchain.FM on Osmosis, or 2) is currently staked with a top 20 Osmosis validator and instantly redelegates to a bottom 20 Osmosis validator or Interchain.FM. Make Osmosis decentralized again ;)

$SHIRT has one and only one utility. It’s a redemption token for a physical Cosmos tee. A Cosmos tee can only be redeemed with a $SHIRT. 1 $SHIRT = 1 tee. The snapshot for the recipients of the 100 free mint will be taken on May 23rd. In order to prevent Sybil-attacks attempting to game this suitdrop, only the top 100 accounts ranked in order by staked voting power will get to mint a $SHIRT.

### FAQ
1. Why is it called the ""suitdrop""? 

Wait and see! 😉

2. What is Suitdrop-as-a-Service?

The last item on the roadmap, SaaS, is a permissionless service for automating merchandise drops that various appchains could use. [suitdrop.zone](http://www.suitdrop.zone/) will be turned into a storefront for anyone to spin up their own merch stores without having to build and maintain bespoke ones from scratch. If you’re Akash, you could have your merch store under suitdrop.zone/akash. Suitdrop-as-a-service lets projects, artists, and individuals submit custom designs to Suitdrop, which is fully integrated with fulfillers covering 3 continents (North America, Europe, and Australia).

"Allow CronCat contracts to be uploaded

This proposal gives the address osmo15wna5dwylkuzvljsudyn6zfsd4zl0rkg5ge888mzk4vtnjpp0z5q4e9w58 the ability to upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis without seeking further governance approval for each upload. 
This address is a multisig administered by the CronCat cofounders. 

CronCat uses a modular factory architecture for security, and after talking internally with the Osmosis team, agreed this would be the optimal path to ship the CronCat contracts and allow for new versions of a handful of CronCat contracts to be stored. 

CronCat has been graciously awarded a grant by the Osmosis team and are excited to bring trustless automation to one of the most monumental app-chains in Cosmos history. 

A helpful, and somewhat technical blog we wrote with the Osmosis team from last year.

"Allow Calculated Finance contracts to be uploaded

This proposal gives the address osmo1r02tlyyaqs6tmrfa4jf37t7ewuxr57qp8ghzly the ability to upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis without seeking further governance approval for each upload. This address is administered by the Calculated Finance protocol core contributors. 

Calculated Finance’s Osmosis contracts have been audited by Oak Security. The finalized audit report can be found here: [https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/master/Calculated Finance/2023-05-23 Audit Report - Calculated Finance v1.1.pdf](<https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/master/Calculated Finance/2023-05-23 Audit Report - Calculated Finance v1.1.pdf>)

These contracts include risk management and smart swap tools that are perfectly complementary to Osmosis’ DEX and overall decentralized vision. These tools allow users to modify recurring swap amounts and actions based on relevant data; for example, modify swap amount as a linear transformation based on a custom multiplier relevant to asset price.  These tools also allow extra functionality and control things such as setting price ceilings, price floors, slippage, swap intervals, amount, swap coefficients, and more. Additionally, it allows users to take actions post-swap such as autostaking of OSMO, or lending accepted assets to Mars protocol. 

Governance approval for contract upload was originally intended to keep the set of DApps running on Osmosis consistent with its objective of being a DeFi hub for the Interchain and as Calculated Finance is a perfect complimentary product to this vision it is reasonable to grant contract upload permissions. 

While this proposal gives authority for osmo1r02tlyyaqs6tmrfa4jf37t7ewuxr57qp8ghzly to permissionlessly upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis, governance only signals approval for contracts relating to the function of Calculated Finance’s swap and auxiliary swap products.

"Add Quicksilver qAssets to Osmosis

This is a signaling proposal to request the addition of Quicksilver’s current and future liquid staked assets (qAssets) be listed on the main Osmosis front end, so long as the unstaked version of the token is also listed. This proposal is based on the suggestions made by numerous Osmosis community members.

Quicksilver uses Osmosis as the hub for its liquidity. qATOM, qOSMO, qREGEN, and qSTARS, as well as the project’s native token QCK have their largest pools on Osmosis. qATOM:ATOM has been in the top 10 largest pools for several weeks. Currently, users have to use Osmosis Frontier to access deposits and withdrawals for these tokens, and have difficultly finding them via the search function on the main Osmosis Front End.

The Quicksilver team is posting this proposal at the encouragement of the Osmosis team. We plan to continue to use Osmosis as the hub for qAsset liquidity, including providing external incentives to pools. Therefore, listing current and future Quicksilver qAssets on the front end would facilitate liquidity growth on Osmosis via qAssets.

This is a signaling proposal to indicate to the Osmosis core contributors the community’s interest in listing these assets on the main Osmosis front end. If it passes, the Osmosis contributors will update the front end to list current and future Quicksilver assets.

"Match External Incentives for qOSMO:OSMO pool (#956)

This is a signaling proposal to request matching of external QCK incentives for the qOSMO : OSMO (pool 956) with OSMO incentives for an initial period of 60 days.

We plan to use these 60 days to gauge liquidity growth on the pool before deciding to make a more comprehensive proposal to add the qOSMO pool to the list of pools that receive continual incentives. 

Quicksilver currently incentivizes the pool with 1k QCK a day. We will extend these incentives to match the timeline of this proposal.

Quicksilver is the liquid staking zone custom-built for the Cosmos ecosystem. It offers users the ability to stake a native chain’s asset and mint a qAsset that represents their principal stake and staking rewards they accrue. Currently, four chains are onboarded onto Quicksilver: Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Osmosis Zone (OSMO), Stargaze Zone (STARS), and Regen Network (REGEN).

"Burn $LUNA and scrap the fork proposals

The title pretty much says it all, $LUNA needs to be burned aggressively. 

Printing so much $LUNA to save a stable coin without a governance proposal was just arrogance at best and showed very little care or respect for the community. 

We need to be cautious of this fork narrative that is being pushed as it is merely to divide the community and divert attention what is really to blame for the crash. 

By forking we are basically saying:
- it is ok have decisions made that do not have the communities best interest 
- it is ok to halt then resume or reset a chain with no regard to the repercussions

"Burn smart - supply limit - separate from ust -restore trust

The only way to get luna back to 100 usd is to burn smart 

we have to use the 3 ways:
- get 1% to 10 % taxes on luna transfert and burn it 
- use half of the reserve of the LFG to buy and burn
- borrow or get investors and convince them to buy and burn half (Binance team could join)
how is that will work?
After separating Ust of Luna we have to set a goal limit of supply to 300 million luna, the volume by hour in binance is between 300billion and 1.4 trillion luna, if we burn 10% of it, the 6.9 trillion luna will decrease each hour by 30 billion upto 140 billion or more, we can decrease the tax rate after until we reach the goal and then stop it.
Burning the half of the reserve and getting investors and borrowers to do so will enhance the trust.
Taking those steps has to bring the price up to 100usd, all we need is a 300 million limit supply and and trust.

"LFG to fund High staking rewards for Terra 2.0 

Hi community, 

I propose that instead of the LFG trying to compensate one group of our community they should help us all. 
Why and how is this possible. 

Firstly why? 
What happened impacted everyone. The same event that caused UST to lose peg also caused $LUNA value to crash. So it makes zero sense to only compensate one group. 
Secondly this creates division. $LUNA stakers are committed community members. If only UST holders are compensated this creates a THEM and US situation. Not good for a rebuild. Not good for our community.

How? How is everyone looked after in this situation?

Firstly the airdrop of new tokens must be EQUAL. 

20% - $LUNA stakers (At the time of de peg) *EXCLUDING LFG staked $LUNA.  
20% - $UST holders (On the Terra network, just prior to depeg)
20% - bLUNA holders (Just prior to depeg) 
20% $LUNA holders (At the time of depeg, On the terra network)
15% - Community fund/developer fund 
5% - $UST/$LUNA holders on the Terra network at this time 

Now everyone has an equal share they need a reason to stay. This is where high staking rewards come in. 
Are many people willing to stake and therefore secure the new network after what happened? Probably not. 
BUT if the staking rewards are high (Over 100% APR) then it gives people a reason to stake, an opportunity to rebuild their losses over time. 
On top of this, high staking rewards attracts new users therefore new buyers, driving price of the new token. 
It benefits Everyone. Not just one group. 

Building a stronger community and increasing the chance of Everyone getting back what they lost. 

Thank you

"Terraswap UST repeg to USD

Propose to help repeg UST to the dollar by incentivizing the purchase and use of UST and burning the extra supply.  
1.  Institute a peg of UST to 1 USD in Terraswap, allowing the swapping of UST for any coin in Terraswap at a 1USD value.  This will incentivize people to purchase UST in outside exchanges, and thus push up the price.  Terraswap users can then transfer those coins to outside exchanges to sell, and repurchase more UST.
2.  Increase the fee paid in Terraswap by 100x as long as the price of UST on the open market is below $0.999
3.  Require fees to be paid in LUNA, as long as the price of UST on the open market is below $0.999
4.  Burn all fees paid on Terraswap and Astroport as long as the price of UST on the open market is below $0.999
5.  Burn all UST and LUNA swapped in Terraswap or Astroport, thus reducing the supply, as long as the price of UST on the open market is below $0.999

This will help push the UST peg back toward 1 USD while helping to compensate previous supporters for their losses in the crash.  In doing this, the supply of LUNA and UST will be reduced drastically as long as the value of UST remains below $.999

Losses from Terraswap during this time should be compensated by the BTC and other crypto reserves of the LFG and community pools.  ",0.16690117292370713

"Match Bitsong External Incentives per Prop 47

As established in Osmosis proposal 47 (https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) the matching of external incentives requires a governance vote to add to the incentive model.
By voting YES you agree to match Bitsong incentives per the Prop 47 external incentives model. BTSG incentives are provided at this rate:

BTSG/OSMO (Pool 573) ~8333.33  BTSG per day corresponding to ~$2000 per day based on the current price at the current value of $0,24 x BTSG
BTSG/ATOM (Pool 574) ~8333.33 BTSG per day corresponding to ~$2000 per day based on the current price at the current value of $0,24 x BTSG
BTSG/UST (Pool 592) ~8333.33 BTSG per day corresponding to ~ $2000 per day based on the current price at the current value of $0,24 x BTSG

By voting NO on this proposal, external BTSG incentives will NOT be matched per the Prop 47 external incentives model.

"Signaling Proposal to match external incentives for the ROWAN:OSMO pool and amend Proposal 135’s swap fee

* By voting YES to this proposal OSMO stakers signal their support for including the ROWAN:OSMO pool 629 in the set of assets that has external incentives matched and support amending the swap fee specified in proposal 135 (details below).
* By voting NO to this proposal OSMO stakers signal their dissent against including the ROWAN:OSMO pool 629 in the set of assets that has external incentives matched and decline to amend the swap fee specified in proposal 135 (details below).

**Details:**
This proposal is a signaling proposal put forth by the core development team at Sifchain (as opposed to Nos Node’s, who is not affiliated with Sifchain, Proposal 135). It signals the inclusion of the ROWAN:OSMO pool 629 into the set of assets that gets external incentives matched with additional OSMO incentives (detailed below).

By voting yes on this proposal OSMO stakers also agree to change the swap fee set forth in Proposal 135 to 0.3% from 0.2% for the ROWAN:OSMO pool 629 which was signaled to receive regular OSMO incentives.

Please note: Sifcore is adding a large amount of initial liquidity to the ROWAN:OSMO pool and believes that it is relevant for them to set the swap fee.

**If this proposal passes:**
ROWAN:OSMO pool 629 will receive the regular OSMO incentives agreed upon in Proposal 135, have a swap fee of 0.3%, and will be added to the OSMO matched external incentive update proposal through the onboarding process.

**External incentive details:**
Sifchain’s external incentive program will allocate a total of 10 million (10,000,000) ROWAN in external rewards to the pool over a span of 28 epochs. This amounts to ~357,142 ROWAN per epoch in external rewards.

"Increase Max Rate of Incentive Adjustment from 20% to 25% (Round 3)

Problem Statement 

 The Adjust Scale parameter of used to dampen volatility in the weekly incentives adjustments algorithm is too low.  Pools are hitting this cap and either not having incentives drained or added quickly enough to reward the liquidity the market is valuing the most.

 This could be detrimental to TVL growth as existing liquidity can become over incentivized while newer liquidity, more valued by the market, struggles to attain justified reward allocations.

 Experimental Problem Solution

 Incrementally increase the Adjust Scale parameter then monitor how frequently pools continue hitting the cap and assess if further increase proposals are warranted.  The hypothesis is that this variable should be turned up to probably 25% but in multiple phases to allow for observation of the impacts.

 Proposal 

 By voting YES on this proposal you signal approval to increase the Adjust Scale variable +5% (20% to 25%) 

 By voting NO on this proposal you signal dissent and want the Adjust Scale variable to remain at 20%

By voting NO to this proposal OSMO stakers signal their dissent against including the XKI:OSMO pool 577 and the XKI:UST pool 578 in the set of assets that has external incentives matched

**Details**

 This proposal is a signaling proposal put forth by the the Ki Foundation. It signals the inclusion of the XKI:OSMO pool 577 and the XKI:UST pool 578 into the set of assets that gets external incentives matched with additional OSMO incentives (detailed below).

Osmosis LPers are going to be eligible for a Cosmon airdrop (Conditions are to be announced soon), our upcoming P2E game, which means that this proposal will facilitate further their participation in Cosmon since XKI is the utility token for the game.

**If this proposal passes:**
XKI:OSMO pool 577 and the XKI:UST pool 578 will benefit from OSMO matched external incentive.

**External incentive details:**
The Ki Foundation’s external incentive program has allocated a total of 10,000,000 XKI ~$2,000,000 value in external rewards to both pools over a span of 180 epochs.

This amounts to ~55,555 XKI (~$11,111) per epoch in external rewards.

"Osmosis community spend proposal HackAtom VI

HackAtom VI, the biggest Hackatom in Cosmos history, concluded on 8 Dec 2021.
According to the Osmosis signal proposal [no.63/ 06.11.2021](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/63), the Osmosis community agreed to register Osmosis as one of the HackAtom sponsor participants, which allowed the Osmosis community to propose a hackathon challenge in one of the existing HackAtom categories.
This sponsorship allocated a total prize budget of 50,000 USD in $ATOM to be paid from the Osmosis Community Pool to the Osmosis winners.
Here are the winners of the Osmosis challenge:
First place in amount of $35,000 in $ATOM: Osmosis (Semi-) Auto Compound by Manuel Richter: The winning prize went to the Osmosis (Semi-) Auto Compound project that automates Osmosis pool compounding as much as possible, opting to implement a semi-automatic wizard seamlessly into the Osmosis UI. Visit [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/osmosis-semi-auto-compound) for more details.
2nd Place in the amount of $15,000 in $ATOM: Classic Trading by Ping Ping, Ding Yi, and Edward Gunawan: The second prize went to this CEX-like dashboard for Osmosis. This project offers a classic trading interface as an alternative way for users to swap on Osmosis, just like on other traditional exchanges. This project comes complete with price charts for all trading pairs and users can explore different charts without changing views. Visit [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/osmosis-semi-auto-compound) for more details.

All in Bits Inc (DBA Tendermint Inc), as the organizer of the HackAtom VI event, is responsible for the distribution of the prizes to the aforementioned winners.
According to HackAtom Rules, All in Bits Inc (DBA Tendermint Inc) will be using the Close Rate of Dec 16th, 2021 (the spot rate as of Dec 16, 2021 at 23:59:59pm) on CoinMarketCap to determine the equivalent number of Atoms representing the value of the prize in US Dollars (“ATOM Equivalent”) that needs to be paid to each winners. The closing price at Dec 16, 2021, 23:59:59pm was of $21.75 = 1 Atom.
As the funds for paying the Osmosis HackAtom winners are coming from the Osmosis community pool, the equivalent of $OSMO tokens on the Date of Dec 16th, needs to be calculated and paid to the winners.
On Dec 16th, the closing price of the $OSMO token as per Coinmarketcap historical data was of $4.18, which accounts for the payment of equivalent 11,962 $OSMO tokens.

All in Bits Inc (DBA Tendermint Inc), as the organizer responsible for distributing and paying the prizes amongst the HackAtom VI - Osmosis Challenge winners, shall receive transfer of the funds for payment in $OSMO tokens at the following wallet address:

"Signaling proposal: Add OSMO incentives to ATOM:CHEQ pool (#617)

**Proposal details**
Signaling proposal to add OSMO incentives to ATOM:CHEQ liquidity pool (#617).
 - By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to the ATOM:CHEQ liquidity pool on Osmosis
 - By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent to adding OSMO incentives to the ATOM:CHEQ liquidity pool on Osmosis.

**Details**This is a signalling proposal to include the ATOM:CHEQ pair into the set of assets which receive OSMO liquidity incentives, which has been requested by the CHEQ community who are eager to provide liquidity.

The benefit to the Osmosis community from cheqd.io is: The team are experts in digital identity, specifically self-sovereign identity (SSI) where the individual holds their own data, following the ""Hold your own keys"" mantra. In a short span of time, they have established partnerships with some of the largest digital identity and SSI software vendors in the world. They want to bring identity to the IBC stack in a way that preserves user privacy and bring Cosmos to the SSI community.

Currently, there are OSMO incentives as well as CHEQ external incentives on CHEQ:OSMO (pool #602). The CHEQ community has added CHEQ external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ (pool #617) and would request the support of the Osmosis community to add OSMO incentives to pool 617.

A previous version of this proposal was submitted with a mismatched title with the feedback provided by the Osmosis community that this should be corrected and resubmitted: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/144

"Reducing the Impact of Volume Manipulation

Voting YES for this proposal indicates acceptance of measures to restrict volume manipulation on Osmosis as well as the use of the linked new Master Incentive sheet. 

 Voting NO for this proposal indicates that volume manipulation should not be restricted by Osmosis governance and/or disapproval of the new linked Master incentive sheet. 

 Background 

 Osmosis determines how much it it spends on a pool's incentives based on the swap fees generated in order to encourage liquidity to the most useful pool. 
 Wash Trading is the practice of swapping tokens within a pool for the sole purpose of artificially increasing the volume traded within that pool. 
 Wash Trading is therefore a dishonest way of increasing the incentives allocated to a pool which does not need additional liquidity to cater for genuine traders. 

 Proposal 

 This proposal has 3 linked parts. 

 1. Agreement that Wash Trading will be penalised by Osmosis Governance in forms such as, but not limited to: 
 - Early completion of the onboarding period to limit the effectiveness of any wash trading 
 - Manual fixing of a pool's incentives to be in line with its TVL 
 - Full removal of incentives from a pool. 

 2. Reduction in the effectiveness of Wash Trading by limiting the Swap Fee used in the subsidy model to 3x the average swap fee across Osmosis 
 - This limits the APRs caused by irregular trading whilst also still maintaining high APRs in genuinely popular pools. 

 3. Adoption of a new Incentive Master sheet with an improved layout 
 - No changes to how incentives are calculated beyond the addition of the swap fee cap in Column Y 
 - Overview page to see at a glance APR changes 
 - Layout change of Calculations with notes to help better explain why changes are happening. 
 - External incentives now pulled in from chain data 
 - Maturity based on a start date of incentives rather than manual adjustment

"Signaling proposal: UMEE incentivized pools (UMEE/UST and ATOM/UMEE pairs)

Proposal Details

- By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to UMEE/UST (#642) and ATOM/UMEE (#643) pools on Osmosis.
- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to UMEE/UST (#642) and ATOM/UMEE (#643) pools on Osmosis.

Details

This is a signaling proposal to include UMEE pairs, UMEE/UST (#642) and ATOM/UMEE (#643), into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. After this proposal has passed governance, the UMEE pools will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

"Osmosis v7 Carbon Upgrade

# Osmosis Carbon Upgrade

This proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the [v7.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height `3401000`, which is estimated to occur on February 28, UTC 8:00PM. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. 

## Upgrade features

This upgrade adds the following features:
* Superfluid Staking
* Permissioned CosmWasm
* IAVL improvements (improved epoch times)
* UX improvements around LP bonding

See more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v7.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)

## Getting prepared for the upgrade

All nodes will require 64GB of memory. This must consist of a **minimum** of 32GB of RAM, while the remaining 32GB can be swap. For best results, use 64GB of physical memory. Note that this is **double the recommendation for the Boron upgrade**. Also note that the inclusion of wasm means that nodes must use amd64 to run.

Please refer to the following setup instructions on how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md).

Namely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you should install the v1.0.0 release of cosmovisor) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v7.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin/`.

If you do not wish to use cosmovisor, be prepared to upgrade at around 8:00PM UTC, February 28th if this proposal passes.

The Osmosis blockchain will halt when network reaches the halt height. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v7.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.

## Details of upgrade time

The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `3401000`, anticipated to be at `Monday February 28th 8:00PM UTC`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.46 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.

The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 120 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.

### Testing your upgrade setup

There is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.


### Superfluid delegation 

In this upgrade""s superfluid module, you can stake LP shares for specific governance-approved pools. A ""superfluid discount factor"" parameter exists for the superfluid module to ensure stability in the early rollout of superfluid staking, the superfluid discount factor parameter is set to 50% in this upgrade. This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.

The user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.

Here is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:

#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing
*Condition*
- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.
- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.
- Suppose you have designated validator ""Dogemosis"" as your superfluid validator.
- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%

*Result*
- Your delegation to ""Dogemosis"" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.
- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.
- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares. In essence, effective slashing rate increases to the lower the risk factor is set to.

#### On Changes to the delegation amount depending on changes in spot price
Lets now suppose the spot price in the pool changes during this epoch to be 1 ATOM = 1 OSMO, and your LP share changes to being `(75 OSMO, 75 ATOM)`. Upon the next epoch, the effective staked OSMO amount will be calculated as `75 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 67.5 OSMO` to reflect the change in the underlying OSMO amount of the LP token.

As the amount of OSMO backing the LP share increased (hence increasing the effective superfluid staked amount), the staking rewards will also increase.",0.0008091138335317716
"Signaling Proposal: Add DEC Incentivized Pools (ATOM & OSMO)

Proposal details 
 
 Signaling proposal for DEC incentivized pool (see: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3881-signaling-proposal-add-dec-incentivized-pools-atom-osmo) 
  - By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to DEC-liquidity pools 644 and 645 on Osmosis. 
 - By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to DEC-liquidity pools 644 and 645 on Osmosis. 
 
 Details 
 This is a signaling proposal to include DEC pairs into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. These pairs, DEC/ATOM (pool 645) and DEC/OSMO (pool 644), are lives as of February 17th, 2022. 
 After this proposal has passed governance, the DEC pools will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/UST and OSMO/LUNA

By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on OSMO/UST (#560) and OSMO/LUNA (#561) pools on Osmosis. 

 By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on OSMO/UST (#560) and OSMO/LUNA (#561) pools on Osmosis. 

 Details 
 This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the two major Terra OSMO pools. These pools currently are the second and third largest OSMO pools on Osmosis by Total Value Locked.
 At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~11 million OSMO from these pools to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the ~15 million OSMO from the initial OSMO/ATOM pool.

 UST is a stablecoin that tracks the price of the US Dollar. Users mint new UST by burning LUNA. 

 LUNA is the Terra protocol’s native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra Stablecoins. LUNA is used for governance and in mining. Users stake LUNA to validators who record and verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees. The more Terra is used, the more LUNA is worth.

"Osmosis Carbon Neutrality through Purchasing and Retiring NCT

Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval to address Osmosis’ carbon emissions footprint by purchasing 1 year of carbon credits at worst case projections through Regen Network
Voting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated.
Based on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, Osmosis is projected to emit at most 5,100 tons a year in carbon, negatively affecting our climate. Regen Network, in partnership with Toucan and Moss.Earth, have already launched a version of NCT on Polygon at a price of $10 per credit.
This proposal asks for a spend of 6,600 $OSMO from the Community Pool to purchase 5,100 NCT from Regen Network to cover Osmosis’ historical carbon emissions, confirming Osmosis' carbon neutrality blockchain up to June 2022.

Method
 These funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of 
Cory Levinson (Regen Network)
Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)
NosNode (Osmosis Validator)

The $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase NCT. This will then be retired to offset Osmosis’ carbon emissions.
Any $OSMO remaining due to price fluctuations below the intentional 20% buffer to mitigate any price volatility, and a potentially lower NCT cost, will be returned to the Osmosis Community Pool.

"Match External Incentives for SWTH/OSMO


**Proposal Details**

Match external incentives provided by Carbon for [SWTH/OSMO (#651)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/651). External incentives will begin on 23 March 2022 and will continue for 70 epochs.

- By voting YES on this proposal, external SWTH incentives will be matched at 1,578 USD per day.
- By voting NO on this proposal, external SWTH incentives will NOT be matched at 1,578 USD per day.

**Context**

The Carbon team has provided external incentives amounting to 6,000,000 SWTH for the [SWTH/OSMO pool (#651)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/651) over the course of 70 epochs, beginning on 23 March 2022, which is valued at approximately 110,520 USD in total, at the current price of 0.01842 USD.

Therefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for 1,578 USD per day.

"Signalling proposal for MARBLE/OSMO(#649) incentivized pool.

Proposal details
Signaling proposal for MARBLE incentivized pool.
- By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to MARBLE-OSMO liquidity pool 649 on Osmosis.
- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to MARBLE-OSMO liquidity pool 649 on Osmosis.

Details
This is a signaling proposal to include MARBLE-OSMO (pool #649) pair into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives.
After this proposal has passed governance, the MARBLE-OSMO pool #649 will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

About Marble DAO
Marble is the first Inter-chain community-driven DAO. Marble is building a platform with several helpful tools for the Cosmos ecosystem such as:
• Dashboards with relevant information about the DAO, $MARBLE, $BLOCK and other tokens (for example price charts, on-chain data)
• DEX with $BLOCK as incentives
• NFTs Marketplace where community can trade the ""Marblenauts"" and the ""Marble NFTs""
• Marble aims to create value in the Treasury and spread it among its members. Being part of the DAO is a way to earn new tokens and NFTs

$Marble has been airdropped to more than 42% (+20400) Juno staker. $Block will be airdropped to Osmosis & Junoswap LPers, Marble holders/stakers/voters.

"Establish Carbon Market on Osmosis

Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval of a joint funding venture with Regen Network to establish deep liquidity of a Carbon Market on Osmosis through protocol owned liquidity and pool incentives. 

 Voting NO to his proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated. 

Based on feedback from validators collected by Regen, the Cosmos ecosystem is projected to cause, at most, 84,700 tons a year of carbon dioxide emissions with an estimate of 22,596.5 tons of emissions.
In order to provide sufficient liquidity for any Cosmos chain or validator to choose to offset their project for multiple years it is proposed that liquidity of 211,750 NCT is established, owned between the Osmosis and Regen governance.
Regen Network intend to match any protocol owned liquidity in the NCT/REGEN pool and so to meet this target Osmosis would purchase 105,875 NCT at an estimated price of $10 a credit, as well as utilizing around 1.235 Million REGEN of the 1,399,507 gifted to the Osmosis community pool as an pooling pair.
The NCT/REGEN pool has been chosen as a non-incentivized pool. Due to Osmosis paying for liquidity based on fees, any fees generated by trading in this pool would result in Osmosis paying to incentivize liquidity that is not needed due to the unbonded protocol liquidity. This instead can act as a source of both tokens to seed other, incentivized pools, to increase liquidity and so stability of both NCT and REGEN across Osmosis as a whole through arbitrage.
As an added benefit, based on average swap fees, around 5,400 NCT would be acquired by this community pool held liquidity per year. A portion of this can be routinely retired and cause Osmosis’ carbon neutrality to be self-sustaining.
The remaining REGEN will be used to incentivize the NCT/OSMO pool to attract deeper liquidity, an arbitrage option for NCT/REGEN and a route to the Osmosis base pair for ease of trading. Around 165,000 REGEN should remain in the community pool after the previous two proposals, providing incentives of approximately $1,500 per day for 90 days.
Including a 20% buffer for price volatility, this proposal asks for a community pool spend of 140,000 $OSMO and 1,399,507 $REGEN to establish the Osmosis’ community pool share of this liquidity.
In order to ensure that supply and demand do not place an artificial premium on NCT, the pools will only become available on Osmosis once the ability to tokenise existing offchain carbon credits, non-custodially bridge NCT from Polygon across to the IBC and retire NCT on Regen is fully available to the average user through frontend tooling. This spend is being requested early as the cost of a Carbon Credit has recently been lower than usual and so Osmosis will be able to purchase this liquidity at a reduced rate in preparation for a coordinated launch.

Benefits to Osmosis
 The spend would be retained in the community pool as protocol owned liquidity and so no value should be lost from this proposal.
Swap fees in this pool, at Osmosis average, would generate around $54,000 in revenue each year for the protocol.
 Retiring a portion of this revenue each year will ensure that Osmosis remains carbon neutral permanently.
 Through encouraging use of the Regen Network, the value of Osmosis protocol owned liquidity will increase to cater for projects yet to be connected via IBC. 

Method
These funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of 
   Cory Levinson (Regen Network)
   Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)
    Nos Node (Osmosis Validator)

The $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase the NCT.
The NCT and any remaining $OSMO will then be returned to the multisig address on Osmosis.
200 $OSMO will then be used to establish NCT/REGEN and a OSMO/NCT pool on Osmosis. These costs are paid into the community pool.
All of the $NCT will then be paired with $REGEN in a ratio to maintain the purchase price of $NCT.
The GAMM tokens for NCT/REGEN will then be returned, unbonded, to the Osmosis Community Pool, along with any remaining $OSMO tokens.
Any remaining REGEN will be loaded as external incentives on the OSMO/NCT pool over a 90 day period, start time to be determined when NCT on Regen is fully live.

"Increase Voting Period to 5 days

Voting Yes to this proposal raises the governance parameter Voting_Period to five days./n/nVoting No to this proposal causes the governance parameter Voting_Period to remain at three days./n/nBackground/nThree day voting periods have enabled rapid change, something integral to the experimental spirit of Osmosis. The short voting period allows patches to be deployed rapidly, rapid iteration of proposals to find an acceptable choice as well as the incentives allocated to pools to be adjusted in response to recent volume changes.
However, the submission of a proposal to chain sparks debate from those who may not have had the opportunity to feedback on the proposal's wording and intent due to other commitments. The three day voting period gives a sense of urgency to debate with voters potentially unable to impartially weigh both sides. This is further exacerbated by proposals which are put to chain on the weekend which minimises the work days that validators and delegators have to research and discuss whilst on chain. Proposals posted on commonwealth often have issues that appear when exposed to this wider audience that need to be resolved./nThere is a github issue that would allow the best of both worlds, but this takes time to develop from an already busy development schedule. https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/567/nRaising the voting time from a three day period to a five day period will allow more thorough discussion to occur on proposals put on chain in exchange for lowering the speed of governance changes on Osmosis./n/nCommonwealth Post: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3929-proposal-increase-param-voting_period-to-5-days",0.013605967482266057

Onboarding for pool 649 (prop 180)
Matching incentives for pool 651 (prop 178)
This adjustment also implicitly grants regular incentive onboarding to pool 651, as otherwise the caps of prop 133 would result in nullifying the effects of prop 178

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS, OSMO/SCRT and OSMO/CRO

By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS (#604), OSMO/SCRT (#584) and OSMO/CRO (#9) pools on Osmosis. 

 By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS (#604), OSMO/SCRT (#584) and OSMO/CRO (#9) pools on Osmosis. 

 Details 
 This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in three additional OSMO pools. These pools currently are the fifth, sixth and seventh largest OSMO pools on Osmosis by Total Value Locked.
 At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~2.4 million OSMO from these pools to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the ~30 million OSMO from the currently enabled pools.
This proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of these chains sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance.

 Stargaze is a community-owned interchain NFT marketplace.
 Secret is a privacy orientated blockchain.
 Cronos is the token for the Crypto.com platform.

"Launch the Osmosis Grants Program

By voting **YES**, the OGP will be launched with 1,500,000 OSMO tokens from the community pool.

By voting **NO**, OSMO holders voice their dissent against the OGP.

**Details**
- An Osmosis Grants Program (“OGP”) should be launched to fund new community-built tooling, infrastructure and projects building on top of Osmosis.

- We propose an initial budget for the program of up to 1,500,000 OSMO tokens for a 6 month program with quarterly community review. OGP is not obligated to spend this amount; quality always comes first.

- Funds will be managed by a 7 person multi-sig consisting of:
- Sunny Aggarwal (Osmosis team)
- Figment
- Eddie Hartmann (Osmosis team)
- Cosmostation
- Brandon Curtis (Independent)
- Coldchain (Independent)
- Dan Elitzer (Nascent)

- At the end of the initial six month term and then every quarter thereafter, the community can terminate the program via governance and any unspent OSMO tokens will be returned to the community pool.

- The program would be run by a Program Lead (Reverie) supported by seven reviewers, who also function as the multi-sig. Reverie has been working closely with the Osmosis team and the committee for the past few months for setup.

- Reverie proposes monthly compensation of $70k while it is administering the OGP as well a $100k one time setup grant to permit best in class legal and operational setup.

- As part of this proposal, weve included a preliminary version of the website, as well as an initial set of funding RFP ideas.

"Multihop Discount on Osmosis Pools

Voting Yes for this proposal indicates that a multihop discount should be adopted when OSMO is the intermediary token

Voting No for this proposal indicates that the current swap fee structure should remain in place

This proposal is to develop and implement a multihop discount on OSMO pools to provide traders with the lowest fee possible and promote the use of OSMO pools.
When a trade consists of just two OSMO pools during a single transaction, the swap fees would be automatically halved. This would result in cheaper transactions for all trades no matter the volume being traded as well as a higher proportion of the costs going to swap fees and so liquidity providers rather than being lost to slippage.
OSMO pools currently used in multi-hop transactions would see lower fees generated per trade, but counter-intuitively, the total swap fees generated over time will increase due to the lower fees per transaction encouraging a much higher volume of trades due to a phenomenon known as volatility harvesting.

- By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to the SWTH/OSMO (#651) pool on Osmosis.
- By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the SWTH/OSMO (#651) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**
This is a signalling proposal to include the SWTH/OSMO (#651) pool into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. After this proposal has passed governance, this SWTH pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

**About Carbon (SWTH)**

Carbon is a protocol that powers cross-chain financial markets and ecosystems. As a custom-purposed blockchain, Carbon is designed specifically to allow trading of sophisticated financial instruments such as options, bonds and futures at scale. Developers can also build any kind of DeFi application on top of Carbon, while enjoying multi-chain interoperability. Carbon is currently integrated across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Zilliqa, Neo, as well as any IBC-compatible chain such as Osmosis, Terra, and Cosmos Hub. Carbon currently powers decentralized, cross-chain order-book trading of spot and futures markets on Demex.

Since the addition of the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis last month, the pool has already garnered over USD 1.72m in liquidity, with a 7D average trading volume of USD 137k.

Via Carbon governance, additional SWTH rewards have been allocated to the OSMO/BUSD spot liquidity pool on Carbon, as well as the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis.

"Match External Incentives to extended STARS/OSMO and ATOM/STARS pairs

STARS incentives to Osmosis pools have been proposed in [Stargaze Prop 23](https://www.mintscan.io/stargaze/proposals/23). These incentives amount to 50M STARS over 180 days, 166,666.6667 STARS/day for the OSMO pool, and 111,111.1111 STARS/day for the ATOM pool.
If passed this proposal will enable matching of these amounts with extra OSMO incentives.

About Umee
Umee is a cross chain DeFi hub that interconnects between blockchains. As a base layer blockchain, applications and money lego primitives can be built on top of Umee to access cross chain leverage and liquidity. We believe that Umee and Osmosis can complement each other to offer a superior DeFi experience for users of the Cosmos ecosystem.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/CMDX

By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/CMDX (#601) pool on Osmosis.
By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/CMDX (#601) pool on Osmosis.

 Details
 This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/CMDX pool (#601). This pool is currently the eighth largest OSMO pool on Osmosis by Total Value Locked containing around 0.8% of all OSMO liquidity.
 At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~335 thousand OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the ~37 million OSMO from the currently enabled pools.
 This proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of these chains sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/AKT

By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/AKT(#3) pool on Osmosis. 

By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/AKT(#3) pool on Osmosis. 

Details
This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/AKT pool (#3). This pool is currently the ninth largest OSMO pool on Osmosis by Total Value Locked containing around 1.3% of all OSMO liquidity.
 At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~350 thousand OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the ~38.5 million OSMO from the currently enabled pools.
This proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of these chains sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance.

"Signaling proposal to add Cerberus (CRBRUS) pool 662 to the Osmosis incentives program

**Proposal details**
Signaling proposal for CRBRUS incentivized pool.

By voting **YES** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO incentives to the CRBRUS/OSMO (#662) pool on Osmosis.

By voting **NO** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the CRBRUS/OSMO (#662) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**
This is a signaling proposal to include the **CRBRUS/OSMO** (#662) pool into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. This proposal results from the community lobbying to submit a proposal to have incentives added to the pool to help develop liquidity. In addition, the community feels that the upcoming airdrop to OSMO stakers will help generate further liquidity in the pool by having incentives and incentivizing those who provide liquidity. After this proposal has passed governance, this CRBRUS pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

**Current External Incentives**
Cerberus stakers have already voted on a proposal for external incentives on pool #662. Starting April 4, 2022, 1.75 billion CRBRUS had been added to the pools’ gauges for external incentives to be divided over 180 epochs for liquidity providers.

1-day bonding period, 250 billion CRBRUS has been allocated to external incentives
7-day bonding period, 500 billion CRBRUS has been allocated to external incentives
14-day bonding period, 1 billion CRBRUS has been allocated to external incentives

**About Cerberus (CRBRUS)**
**Cerberus** is a sovereign layer-1 chain and the first-ever three-headed meme-coin to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. The project launched on March 15, 2022, to the public, focusing on being a community-focused meme-coin and NFT project that allows the community to vote on various governance proposals to determine the chain's development. The project's roadmap for the second half of 2022 will primarily focus on the upcoming Cerberus NFT collections. The first NFT collection will launch on the OmniFlix network sometime in Q2. Users will also be able to use Cerberus in the future as a utility token on the OmniFlix network. Other partnerships are currently in the works to expand the use-case of Cerberus as a utility token on other networks.

"Canonical Ethereum Bridge Provider: Approval Voting Procedures & Reciprocal Expectations for Bridge Provision

Voting YES to this Proposal means that you assent to using the following procedures to vote for a Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider (BSP) for app.osmosis.zone, a relationship whose initial, mutable expectations are outlined below.

Voting NO means you do not assent to these procedures and expectations. VETO and ABSTAIN have their normal functions.

LIMITATION OF SCOPE: A YES vote assents to these procedures ONLY for the series of five Osmosis governance proposals outlined below. To guard against malicious or confusing proposals, only proposals made by osmo19mywfjzj324w5ukf7ss6jak0dg9hnljfp0rfx4 will be considered under these rules. Future use of these (or similar) procedures must be separately approved by governance.

APPROVAL VOTING PROCEDURES: Five Osmosis Governance Proposals will be proposed under these rules, one each for the four bridge service providers being voted upon: 1) Axelar, 2) Gravity Bridge, 3) Nomad, and 4) Wormhole, as well as 5) a “do nothing” proposal.

WINNER: The Bridge Service Provider (BSP) proposal (or “do nothing”) from this set that receives the highest total amount of YES voting power at the end of the collective voting period will win, provided that QUORUM is reached and a RUN-OFF is not activated. That BSP will enter into a relationship with Osmosis DAO whose initial parameters are outlined below.

NO, NO WITH VETO, and ABSTAIN votes will have NO EFFECT on the tally of yes voting power for the approval voting results. In other words, a bridge could win the approval vote even if it has more NO/VETO vote power than YES, as long as it has the most YES voting power among the BSP proposals.

QUORUM: As long as the total YES voting power received across the 5 approval voting proposals is equivalent to regular Osmosis quorum (20% of total Osmosis voting power), quorum will be considered to have been reached.

RUN-OFF: At the end of the collective voting period, any BSP or “do nothing” proposal that has received within 15% of the leading proposal’s total will be entered into a run-off governed by these same rules and expectations, except that the run-off result will be final, with no further run-offs. This 15% will be measured as a percentage of the total voting power available on Osmosis for this set of proposals (NOT 15% of the top vote-getter’s YES voting power).
For example, assuming 122M total staked OSMO available to vote, the 15% run-off spread is 18.3M. Therefore, if Bridge X gets 53M YES voting power, Bridge Y gets 35M, and Bridge Z gets 25M, Bridges X and Y will be entered into a run-off.

BRIDGE SERVICE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP EXPECTATIONS:
The Osmosis DAO is asking Osmosis Labs to integrate the BSP into app.osmosis.zone to provide canonical, unprefixed bridged assets from Ethereum. The implementation details will be left to Osmosis Labs and the chosen BSP, but the general shape of the initial expectations is as follows. These expectations are subject to change as circumstance, future governance, and social consensus dictate.

From Osmosis, the BSP can expect:
Default Asset List – the Ethereum assets bridged by the selected provider will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone default asset list – i.e. their bridged ETH and ERC-20 assets will be ETH, USDC, etc., all other bridges' assets would be bridge1ETH, bridge2USDC, and the like. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions. In the near future, we expect custom token lists to become the norm in Cosmos, as they are on Ethereum, so that users can search for and import tokens that they want to interact with.
Osmosis Incentives – the DAO commits to prioritizing the assets of the canonical bridge, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools–under the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.
Integration – Osmosis expects to work closely with the BSP. At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).

From the BSP, Osmosis can expect:
Integration / Availability – the BSP will help optimize integrations in a timely manner in accordance with Osmosis’ stated goals of achieving deposits and withdrawals from the app.osmosis.zone UI and Keplr Wallet (without pass-through to the bridge UI).
Liquidity Mining Incentives – if a project’s proposal included the promise of incentives (e.g. Axelar, at least 1% of Axelar tokens to be used for incentives on Osmosis).

Revocability / At-will / Permissionless: As noted, these expectations are preliminary and subject to change as the DAO, developers, and the bridge team see fit. Osmosis DAO and the BSP will be working with each other for their mutual benefit, without contractual promise or obligation. It will be up to the BSP team to maintain a good relationship with Osmosis Labs regarding the front-end implementation details. Osmosis DAO empowers Osmosis Labs to change BSPs if in their estimation, the relationship has become unworkable, or the technical landscape suggests a superior solution, subject to ratification by the DAO.
Should the arrangement become unworkable for either party for whatever reason, the arrangement can be changed or terminated without notice. Any damages for bad behavior (broken promises, bridge failures) will be to reputation alone. Specific promises between the BSP and an individual user (e.g. bridge insurance) are not covered by this disclaimer, nor are potential future agreements between the DAO and various developers, teams, or individuals.

"Reduce OSMO/ATOM Pool Swap fee to 0.2%

Voting YES for this proposal would reduce the Pool 1 (OSMO/ATOM) swap fee from 0.3% to 0.2% 

Voting NO for this proposal indicates that the Pool 1 (OSMO/ATOM) swap fee should remain unchanged at 0.3%

 Background
 With the passing of Proposal 187 (Multihop Discount on Osmosis Pools) most trades should be routed through OSMO pools. 
 OSMO pools mostly have swap fees set at 0.2%, however the major ATOM/OSMO pool (#1) has a swap fee of 0.3%. This causes some direct trades between ATOM/X to have a lower, or identical cost in swap fee to the multi-hop routes. As trades via OSMO pools usually benefit from their higher liquidity and so have lower slippage costs in comparison to non-OSMO pools they may still be the more optimal route for larger trades. The use of OSMO pools as the optimal trade route for user purchases is beneficial for Osmosis.
 Ideally this would be voted on purely by Pool 1 Liquidity Providers, however pool sub-governance is not functional yet and so this will be asked of all Osmosis governance and implemented during the next software upgrade if passed. 
 Pool 1 Liquidity Providers specifically should see compensatory swap fees generated from the new routes passing through the pool as well as increased frequency of volatility harvesting as mentioned in the multihop proposal.

 Affected routes:
 From Identical swap fees to Multihop being having lower swap fees: ATOM/JUNO, ATOM/STARS, ATOM/CMDX, ATOM/LUM, ATOM/NGM, ATOM/IOV
 From higher swap fees in Multihop to Identical swap fees: ATOM/IXO, ATOM/DEC, ATOM/CHEQ

 For a full comparison of the swap fees by route before and after the change proposed see here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFI4S5wqDoC-WiUbWoLJ0dRbylqbvQ1ZTjpiN71lkGA

"Signalling Proposal for Incentivized Canonical USDC pool

By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/USDC (#678) pool on Osmosis.

 By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/USDC (#678) pool on Osmosis.

 Details
 This is a signalling proposal to include the, now canonical Axelar USDC pool, OSMO/USDC (#678) pool into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. After this proposal has passed governance, this pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.

About USDC
USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars, backed by dollar denominated assets held in segregated accounts with US regulated financial institutions.
 Since its launch in 2018, USDC has become powerful market infrastructure for applications and businesses of all sizes in nearly every industry. USDC flows seamlessly across many of the world’s leading blockchains and is widely used throughout this transformative internet layer.

"Make Osmosis the Co-Lead Sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022

Summary:

If this signaling proposal passes, the funding provided by Osmosis proposal #110 will be used to make the Osmosis community the co-lead sponsor of the Cosmoverse Conference 2022.

Description:

Cosmoverse is an annual conference with the goal to unite Cosmonauts from all over the world and raise more awareness of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. This year’s Cosmoverse 2022 will take place in Medellin, Colombia - on September 27 & 28.
Just as last year, Cosmoverse will keep a strong community spirit. We aim to bring the Cosmos community together in one room with core Cosmos builders. The community will be able to ask questions, listen to keynote speeches, and talk to Cosmos core developers face to face. This also gives Cosmos projects the opportunity to strengthen their relationship with the community.

Why should the funds from prop #110 be used for sponsorship?

Prop #110 was submitted by NosNodes (https://twitter.com/NosNodes) with the purpose to incentivize more community building by the Cosmoverse team. Thank you, NosNodes! <3

After Prop #110 passed, the Cosmoverse team received 20,000 OSMO in funding. We are extremely grateful for that. 
We were able to use the funds to organize meetups (like the Denver Meetup: https://twitter.com/CosmoverseHQ/status/1495248152865042434?s=20&t=MZgUGjZuO6tkZBDB5Jmnqw), pay the initial deposit for the Medellin conference and cover travel expenses. 
Without Osmosis, Cosmoverse would never have become what it is today.

How does it benefit the Osmosis community?

The funds from Osmosis prop #110 will make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.

- Keynote speech: We offer two keynote slots to the Osmosis core team. Speakers TBA on our official Twitter account.
- Booth in networking area: We offer Osmosis a prominent booth stand in the main networking area.
- Logo placement: The Osmosis logo will be shown as “co-lead sponsor at the conference.
- General Admission Tickets: We will give 10 general admission tickets to the Osmosis core team or the Osmosis community. Distribution TBD.
- Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.
- Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website

You decide:

- By voting “Yes” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.
- By voting “No” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should not be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.
- “No with Veto” punishes the Cosmoverse team for this proposal
- Vote “Abstain” if you do not have an opinion",0.027430952943938713

"Use Hardfork to Accelerate Proposals #222, #223, and #224

Osmosis Proposals #222, #223, and #224 propose to shift incentives from the OSMO/UST, OSMO/LUNA, and LUNA/UST pools towards the OSMO/USDC, OSMO/ETH, and OSMO/DAI pools. These incentives are crucial to help shift Osmosis liquidity away from Terra-based assets towards Ethereum-based stablecoins and major assets. However, these proposals are normal incentive adjustment proposals that go through the normal 5 day voting process (meaning they won't go into effect for 6 epochs).
 
 Because of the extremely volatile market conditions around Terra, we propose that we accelerate this process by using an 'emergency software upgrade' under special fast-voting rules to allow the incentives to shift faster than the normal 5 day voting period.
 
 The 'fast-voting process' would take the form of being enacted as soon as 2/3 of *total chain voting power* votes Yes on this proposal. At that time, if >2/3 of total voting power has voted Yes on each of #222, #223, and #224, then those proposals will be enabled during the upgrade process.  For example, if and once this proposal receives 66.6% of voting power as Yes, if proposals #222 and #224 have >2/3 voting power, they would both be enacted during the upgrade process.
 
 The process of upgrade would involve a height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary, similar to the v6.0 upgrade. Validators/node operators can change the binary during v7 operations, if the fork is approved. The v8.0 software version will be fully state-compatible with *v8.0* until the divergence block.
 
 No upgrade timeline or software patch should be released until 67% of governance approval has voted yes on this proposal. If so, validators should coordinate to attempt to find a time that suffices for this upgrade. (And importantly _verify_ all changes in this upgrade meet governance approvals)
 
 All validators, and full node operators should update their software to version *v8.0* as soon as possible once 67% of voting power has been reached, the changes have been accepted, and they have verified the code. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal to signal their readiness.
 
 Failure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.

 * Voting YES for this proposal indicates agreement for Osmosis validators to coordinate and perform an emergency upgrade to Osmosis, as authorised by greater than two-thirds of governance approval under the fast-voting conditions outlined above.

"Add functionality to allow depooling of UST pools via emergency upgrade hard fork in proposal #225

Add functionality to allow depooling via emergency upgrade hard fork in proposal #225
 
 Because UST is IBC-native and because bridges to other stablecoins have just now going up, UST has been the predominant stablecoin on Osmosis. UST LP providers thought they were LP'ing with a stablecoin, and now they are facing significant further depeg risk. This proposal seeks to mitigate the IL loss due to the rapid depeg.
 
 UST pools have had unforeseen volatility and due to sigificant full depeg risk, Osmosis users should have a chance to avoid further potential impermanent loss. This proposal gives liquidity providers in these pools the option to take an action to unpool their liquidity in these UST pools if they wish. Unpooling would be a new message action an LP can take on these pools if they were bonded before the emergency proposal time. Unpooling on a 14 day bond will be the equivalent of exiting the pool, and then beginning a 14 day unlock for the constituent assets. This has the affect of confirming any impermanent loss, and will safeguard one half of their remaining liquidity tokens in the event of an asset in the pair going to zero.
 
 Furthermore, by reducing the liqudity between OSMO and UST, it makes the UST->OSMO->ATOM a less liquid exit liquidity path for UST, helping reduce OSMO price impact during further UST depegs.
 
 Governance should be very cautious with this, as its a significant change to Osmosis and may set a dangerous precedent. The change is concerning on multiple fronts, including the fairness to other LP's, using a hard fork for something thats arguably a market design problem, and what is to be expected in the next crash.
 
 Because this process requires a software upgrade and is extremely time sensitive, we propose adding the execution of this to the same mechanism proposed in proposal #225.  Namely, once 2/3 of *total chain voting power* approves proposal #225, if within a short time period, 2/3 of total chain voting power also approves this proposal, then this signals the approval for validators to include functionality enabling depooling in the emergency hard fork.
 
 The list of pools affected is:
 #560 (UST/OSMO)
 #562 (UST/LUNA)
 #567 (UST/EEUR)
 #578 (UST/XKI)
 #592 (UST/BTSG)
 #610 (UST/CMDX)
 #612 (UST/XPRT)
 #615 (UST/LUM)

"Remove Incentives from all Terra pools

Voting YES for this proposal indicates that OSMO incentives should be removed from all Terra related pools and the fixed daily OSMO emissions reallocated to all other Incentivized pools. 

 Voting NO for this proposal indicates that OSMO incentives on Terra pools will remain, and incentives naturally drain over time. 

 Background 
 Due to the hyperinflation of LUNA supply caused by the recent UST depeg event, LUNA pools receive a far higher share of incentives than they should according to the current incentive model. 
 UST incentives will likely also excessive once the hard fork allows unpooling and liquidity falls, as well as when the first people unbonding begin to sell their UST into the pool. 
 As Osmosis incentives cannot be adjusted by more than 25% a week due to the Scaling Cap setting, the incentives on these pools may remain high for several months. This results in Osmosis paying for liquidity in these pools which is, at best, a highly speculative purchase based on any potential recovery model. At worst, users will buy in to obtain a high APR and be used as exit liquidity for people who have unbonded early. 
 While the existing incentives do compensate for Impermanent Loss to some extent, they do not differentiate between users who suffered this and users who bought in since. If this proposal passes, liquidity providers will have obtained 11 days of incentives since the crash.
 The Osmosis emissions taken from the Terra pools will be distributed proportionately to all incentivised pools, giving all pools a boost of around a third of their APR

"[Action Required] Signalling Proposal for Emergency v8 Upgrade at 4402000

This proposal is for coordination of the emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary as already approved in proposals 225 and 226. It is an emergency upgrade hard fork for adding the unpooling feature for UST pools (prop 226) and shifting OSMO incentives off of LUNA and UST related pools (prop 225, 222-224).

This change has been reviewed by a number of validators and experienced cosmos developers. It has had pretty thorough testing on a testnet given the time constraints.

Addendums to unpooling not specified in 226

Unpooling of locks that are superfluid staked will not have slashing risk to avoid the large amount of code complexity implementing this would create and the time it would take to get implement it securely.

Additionally, it seems to have been the intention of prop 226 to include all UST pools, even though some were not included in the prop 226 text. This seems to have been human error on the proposal creators part. Several validators have signalled being in favor of this through several chats.

Upgrade information

This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The v8.0.0 software version is fully state-compatible with v7.3.0 until the upgrade block 4402000, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v6 upgrade (prop 103), used when the IBC channel creation mechanism was broken.
The proposed upgrade block height of 4402000 is estimated to be at May 15, 2022, 16:00 UTC (Sunday).
All validators, and full node operators should update their software to version v8.0.0 prior to 14:00 UTC (Sunday). After doing so, validators should vote yes on this proposal signalling that they have upgraded.
Failure to do so will cause the node to crash – requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.

Actionable(s)
Every node should upgrade their software version from v7.3.0 to v8.0.0 before the upgrade block height 4402000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at upgrades/v7/bin to be v8.0.0, and restart the node. Do check that cosmovisor version says 8.0.0.
Upon upgrading their setup and processing a block, every validator should vote yes on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade.)
Every node should check in at May 15th 2PM (14:00) UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have voted yes on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didn’t upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of the validator voting power has not signalled readiness by 2PM (14:00) UTC, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should revert their binary back to v7.3.0 until further notice.
Furthermore, please review the numbers for the accelerated incentives updates in https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/1481/files#diff-cafe8a3f5831b68ac650982d09609c545f5990c6a1e6602ea4fb5c9bc04aa3bb, and v8 logic.

Failure case and risks involved

In the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - “validators” channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis)

Governance procedure

Voting Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan and that you applied the upgrade and successfully processed a block after.

Voting No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.",0.001684320314495058
"WBTC Incentivised pool with Minimum Incentives of 5%

* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to OSMO/WBTC (#712)

 Details
 This is an incentive change proposal to include OSMO/WBTC (#712) into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives and allocate 5% of incentives to the pool after next epoch. 

 After this proposal has passed governance, this pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process with the minimum incentives level of 5% to encourage onboarding of WBTC liquidity.

 This proposal also notes that this WBTC is a wrapped version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum chain, provided by the Canonical Ethereum bridge provider - Axelar.  A canonical Bitcoin bridge is yet to be determined.  When a Canonical Bitcoin bridge is determined by governance, incentives may be reallocated gradually to transfer Osmosis liquidity of WBTC to that of the Bitcoin provided by this bridge.

"Reallocate Incentives Removed From Terra Pools To Community Pool

* Voting YES for this proposal indicates agreement for allocating the majority of the OSMO incentives that were removed from Terra pools in prop 227 to the Community Pool.

 * Voting NO for this proposal indicates that another plan should be formed for the distribution of the removed OSMO incentives.

 This proposal suggests temporarily directing the majority of the incentives removed from Terra pools in proposal 227 to the Osmosis Community Pool.
 Note that this does not include the initial batch of incentives shifted from Terra pools towards ETH, USDC, and DAI pools in proposal 225 but rather the remaining Terra pool incentives described in proposal 227.
 While these incentives could be used to incentivize further liquidity depth in existing pools, as bearish sentiment around the crypto markets sets in, it is becoming increasingly important to keep the Community Pool well-capitalized to fund community initiatives such as the grants program, protocol owned liquidity and strategic incentives.
 Apart from an overlap period caused by Proposal 227 completing two days before this proposal, the APRs of existing non-Terra pools should not be impacted by this reallocation. The inflationary emissions to the community pool will be returned to normal incentives by the first thirdening (June 19th 2022), which will also ease the step change felt by liquidity providers.

"Incentives - Repo Process and Category Model

n
[Link to commonwealth post](https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4722-incentives-repo-process-and-category-model)

This proposal entails two sub proposals.

1. That we overhaul the meta process for generation of adjustment proposals. This has historically been implemented through a series of google spreadsheets implementing each variant of the mechanism, with static copies made for the generation of each proposal. This shall be replaced with a Github repository based process, which will make public tracking of changes easier, and allow for (nearly) full automation of the proposal generation process.

2. That we modify the current mechanism (bias, subsidy, matching, fee cap, etc) to first group pools into categories, each with a parameterized incentive share, and then pools within each category split that share based on their share of fees collected and external incentives.


## Github Repository

[link to repo](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives/tree/unity/mainnet)

This Github repo will at all times contain at least 3 branches, which (along with some Github Action workflows), serve to automate the process of creating weekly adjustment proposals.

The `main` branch contains the process and data for the most recent proposal.

The `staging` branch contains the process for the next proposal.

Throughout the week, PRs are made to `staging` corresponding to on chain text proposals, such as adding pools to onboarding, matching external incentives, or changing the adjustment process.

A `liveview` branch off of staging is continually updated with new data, so that we can see what we expect the next proposal to look like.

As on chain text proposals pass, their PRs are merged to `staging` (and then merged to the `liveview` branch on the next update).

When it is time for a new adjustment proposal, the `liveview` branch is merged back into `staging` (giving it up to date market data). And then `staging` branch is merged into `main`.

The data in the `main` branch is then used to create the on chain adjustment proposal.



## Category Model

This model groups pools into a number of categories with proportional incentive shares, so that we can prioritize certain classes of liquidity directly.

### Target Share
The share of incentives allocated to each category is then split according to the proportion of swap fees collected by each pool within the category. These values are limited by the `swap fee cap` (currently 3), such that pools will not benefit by having more than 3x the average fee APR of the category.

We then recalculate shares using (capped) fees + external incentives collected by the pool. To limit the incentive increase caused by a match relative to the base incentives, we take the minimum of this `adjusted reveneue` share, and `(1 + matched_multiple_cap) * capped_fee_share`. We set `matched_multiple_cap` at 1, so set matches to be no more than the base incentives of a pool.

### Major

Qualification for `Major` status is determined by governance based on a combination of factors, namely:
- Is the token market cap large relative to `Osmo`
- Does the majority of the trade volume happen outside of Osmosis
- Do we have a strategic interest in attracting more liquidity of this token

This proposal also entails choosing `ATOM`, `WETH`, `WBTC` and `CRO` as starting `Major` tokens. As well as `USDC`, `DAI`, and `EEUR` as stablecoins.

### Minimum Share
Pools can also have a minimum share set by governance, to incentivize liquidity ahead of observed trading volume. We set minimums of 25% of incentives on pools 1 and 5% on pools 674, 704, and 712 as demonstration and to guarantee a large amount of incentives for base liquidity. These parameters would be set and changed by governance and should be used to prioritize the growth of strategic liquidity.
### Categories

These initial category shares were chosen to approximately match the current breakdown of incentives between these groupings, but should be changed over time with follow up text proposals as needed. (And will likely be adjusted along with proposals to add incentives to new pools in the category)

- Osmo/Major - 45%
- Osmo/Stable - 30%
- Osmo/Minor - 20%
- Stable/Major - 0%
- Stable/Stable - 0%
- Others - 5% - Liquidity for Minor tokens paired with non-Osmo

 By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in disabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/UST (#560) and OSMO/LUNA (#561) pools on Osmosis. 

 Details
 This proposal would disable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/UST (#560) and OSMO/LUNA (#561) pools. These pools currently contain around 7% of OSMO liquidity, however this is rapidly decreasing as users unbond and the value of UST and LUNA fluctuate through unforeseen volatility causing there to be fewer OSMO in the pool. 
 At the current 50% discount rate, this would unstake up to ~2.6 million OSMO which were being used to secure the network through staking. However as many users are unbonding from these pools this will be lower. See https://hathornodes.com/resources/staking_dashboard for the recent drop in OSMO being used for Superfluid Staking that indicates this.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/WBTC

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/WBTC(#712) pool on Osmosis.
* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/WBTC(#712) pool on Osmosis.

Details
This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/WBTC pool (#712). This pool is currently the twelfth largest OSMO pool on Osmosis by Total Value Locked containing around 1.07% of all OSMO liquidity.
At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~406 thousand OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the ~32.3 million OSMO from the currently enabled pools.
This proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of chains sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance.
The security in would be that of the Ethereum chain, the Axelar bridge and the WBTC DAO.

* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to OSMO/EVMOS (#722) at a starting incentives share of 0.5%

* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to OSMO/EVMOS (#722) at a starting incentives share of 0.5%

Details
This is an incentives change proposal to include OSMO/EVMOS (#722) into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives with a starting share of incentives of 0.5%
If passing by the time of the regular incentives proposal, these changes will also be merged into the new incentives proposal for the 29th May so the regular incentives proposal does not revert the gauge weights to the current minimums on passing. There will still be incentives changes as the regular proposal will set incentives based on fees generated according to the normal onboarding process. This regular incentives proposal should be voted No on if this proposal was passing on the 29th and later fails.

"Major Incentives Category Rebalance

* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates that liquidity incentive minimums should be reallocated as below

* Voting No for this proposal indicates that existing liquidity incentive minimums should be unaffected by this proposal

Osmosis Liquidity incentives are distributed daily according to the category model established in Proposal #233 with 45% of the daily incentives going to major/osmo pools. These are distributed according to minimum incentive levels established in Proposals #223, #229 and #233 with the remainder distributed proportional to the fees generated by transactions in these pools as follows:
* OSMO/ATOM (#1): 25%
* OSMO/WETH (#704): 4.91%
* OSMO/WBTC (#712): 5%
Leaving 10.09% to be awarded based solely on the share of fees. These currently go 0.9% to CRO and the remainder to ATOM.

This proposal asks that the minimums are redefined to the following in order to further encourage deep liquidity in a variety of Major pools:
* OSMO/ATOM (#1): 15%
* OSMO/CRO (#9): 3%
* OSMO/WETH (#704): 10%
* OSMO/WBTC (#712): 10%
Leaving 7% to be awarded based solely on the share of fees.

A maximum incentive level would also be implemented for OSMO/ATOM (#1) of 25% in order to enable these changes. Without this, Pool #1 continues to draw the majority of the fees due to its size and does not allow newer pools to grow. Further maximum incentive settings can be implemented in future proposals to ensure that Osmosis does not incentivise any one asset excessively.

If passing by the time of the regular incentives proposal, these changes will also be merged into the new incentives proposal for the 29th May so the regular incentives proposal does not revert the gauge weights to the current minimums on passing.

"Approve Axelar via Moonbeam as the Canonical Polkadot Bridge

* Voting YES for this proposal indicates that Axelar via Moonbeam will be considered the Canonical Bridge into the Polkadot Ecosystem for Osmosis

* Voting NO for this proposal indicates that Axelar via Moonbeam will not be considered the Canonical Bridge into the Polkadot Ecosystem for Osmosis

Proposal 206 declared Axelar to be the Canonical Ethereum bridge for Osmosis. This has connected Osmosis to multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains including Moonbeam, an EVM parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem. 
The expectations for bridge provision (approved in Proposal 205) established a strong preference for the winner of the bridge-off to also provide service to other ecosystems: 'At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).' 
axlDOT will soon be available via the Axelar bridge from Moonbeam. This proposal asks that axlDOT is considered to be the canonical DOT on Osmosis until a more IBC Native version of DOT is available, at which point a transition process will be proposed.
Other assets native to the Polkadot ecosystem arriving via this route would also be treated in the same manner. 

Canonical status sets the following agreement:
Default Asset List – assets will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone default asset list, e.g. DOT with all other bridges’ assets being bridge1DOT, bridge2DOT, etc. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions.
Osmosis Incentives – the DAO commits to prioritizing the Canonical Bridge assets, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools–under the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.

"Osmosis v9 Nitrogen Upgrade

## Osmosis Nitrogen Upgrade

This is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v9.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 4707300, which is estimated to occur on Tuesday June 7th, UTC 16:00. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.

## Upgrade Features
This upgrade adds the following features:

### GAMM API changes
API changes were done to enable more CFMM's to be implemented within the existing framework.
Integrators will have to update their messages and queries to adapt, please see https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/gamm/breaking_changes_notes.md

### Governance Changes
* Superfluid stakers now have their votes override their validator's votes
* Governance can set a distinct voting period for every proposal type

### IBC
* Upgrade to IBC v3
* Enable Interchain account host module
* See [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/app/upgrades/v9/upgrades.go#L49-L71) for the supported messages

### Txfees
* Non-osmo txfees now get swapped into osmo every day at epoch, and then distributed to stakers.

### Cosmwasm
* Upgrade from wasmd v0.23.x to v0.27.0. This has the following features:
  * State sync now works for cosmwasm state
  * Cosmwasm builds on M1 macs
  * Many security fixes

* The TokenFactory module is added to the chain, making it possible for users and contracts to make new native tokens.
    * Cosmwasm bindings have been added, to make swapping and creating these new tokens easier within the contract ecosystem.


## Getting Prepared for the Upgrade
As always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.

If using cosmovisor, either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v9/bin/.

If not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v9.0.0 binary.


## Details of Upgrade Time
The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be 4707300, anticipated to be on Tuesday June 7th 16:00 UTC. This uses an average block time of 6.3730 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown [here](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/4707300)

The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.",0.0008365878244475841

UST needs to be thought of as a debt owed by Luna Holders.

There is no sense saving an ""ecosystem"" that is just another random coin with little use case and a failed trust.

So, a tax 15% on all Luna transactions should be implemented.  Of that tax, 7.5% should be burnt to help Luna supply correct and 7.5% should go to a pool that is paid equally to all UST Holders of record once daily. This way, there is now an extra incentive to hold UST and a way to add value to it.  This value increase should allow it to slowly repeg as it should.

"PLAN B

At the moment you can't just buy the moon back and brciar them to re-establish the peg. Luna is heavily compromised and has a too low price, which could create security problems with direct attacks on governance, which is why Do Kwon's choice to create a fork makes sense, and it is the right way to go, but it is not enough. these steps will also have to be taken to ensure the safety that LUNA and UST lacked.
1. Take a snapshot of the values ​​of the various portfolios before the attack and create 2 classes of NFT:
Holders of NFT LUNA
NFT UST holders
which will be customized with the value of the individual portfolios of the owners of the LUNA at the value before the collapse.
This will allow, as soon as activated, to receive an Airdrop of the new currency (eg “LUNA2” and “UST2”) which will have a market value equal to the date of the snapshot.
Unfortunately this will not be enough because, if we do not solve the famous ""death spiral"", nothing prevents it from happening again.
This collapse has shown how currently relatively large volumes can undermine UST's PEG and even more how rapid movements destabilize its anchoring.
2. Study an algorithm that slows down or prevents instant withdrawals above a certain threshold (the threshold will be calculated based on how long it will take to return to the peg if a certain order or X number of orders were executed simultaneously)

This would prevent those who want to manipulate the value of UST2 from instantly moving capital.
The threshold will only be set to protect the ecosystem and not prevent whales from entering, so it will be well calibrated.
3. Instead of using only LUNA to maintain the PEG, it is possible to create not pools, but independent tanks of different redistributed coins which will intervene alternately to stabilize both LUNA2 and UST2 for example as follows: 40% BTC 25% LUNA 15% USDT / USTC /… 20% from the coins of the various CEXs who want to collaborate in the creation of the first large decentralized currency.

Conversion: (xLUNA) = (Number of LUNA to be converted on date) / (Total LUNA supply on date)

"Repudiate the 1.2% burn tax

The 1.2% burn tax sends the wrong message (for both USTC and LUNC but especially LUNC). It has never faced a vote of the entire Terra Classic community. This proposal calls for rejecting the Burn Tax.

We can't tax our way out of this problem. Right now, LUNC is a generic Cosmos chain with a lot of users. Serious dapp devs, who would normally be naturally incentivized to build dapps around such a large, passionate user base, will not consider building on the Terra Classic ecosystem if every user interaction faces a 1.2% tax.

In terms of the LUNC market itself, the 1.2% burn tax is a huge increase in transaction costs. If you massively raise the taxes on something you will get much less of it. Liquidity for USTC and LUNC is thus likely to go down severely after the tax has been implemented. Whales will also be able to dump their LUNC before the tax increase takes effect. The result would be a massive drop in LUNC's price.

Longer term we want to incentivize economic activity to return to the Terra Classic chain, instead of staying off-chain and allowing Binance Kucoin etc to collect the vast majority of trading revenue. That can;t happen with a high burn tax. LUNC exists in perfect competition with other ETH-alts that all charge low transaction fees.

Terra Luna Classic Community


Terra Luna Classic’s past success was earned due to the success its algorithmic feature, which became its identity.


The PEG of USTC is vital mechanism for LUNC, especially now when the Total supply needs to be reduced drastically and fast.

There is a long list of reasons why LUNC COMMUNITY should vote to put Time-Limit on REPEG proccess but main ones are as follows:


- Investors Leaving the project,
- Delaying Repeg could compromise the longevity of this project,
- Failure of implementing 1.2% Burn Tax Offchain,
- Inability to reduce LUNC total supply to 10B (LUNC tokens) etc.


Our proposal is as follows:
Devs that are working on LUNC Rivitalization (which REPEG is part of it) to shift focus from other projects to Repegging USTC, and place a time-limit for this process.

"Reward and Punishment

With the recent challenge to the Terra Luna Classic Community, a Reverse Uno Card will be presented by the community to challenge all centralized exchanges (CEX) that are not implementing the 1.2% Off-Chain Burn Tax. Here we present the concept of Reward and Punishment.

The community has overwhelmingly voted on the 1.2% Burn Tax On-Chain and Off-chain and to implement this we will reward those who comply and punish those who don't. 

For those who doesn't want to implement the burn tax off-chain, a higher on-chain burn tax will be implemented. This will be a graduated tax based on the total LUNC they are holding.

Based on the total volume for the past n days (proposal is 7 days), if the wallet address did not burn the corresponding 1.2% off-chain burn tax, a higher on-chain burn tax will be slapped whenever a deposit/withdrawal will be made by that wallet. A sample of graduated tax is shown  below

% of total Supply that 	  On Chain Burn Tax %
the exchange is holding
> 50%	                                     25%
40 - 49%	                                     20%
30-39%	                                     15%
20-29%	                                     10%
10-19%	                                       5%
0-9%	                                            2.5%
 
50% of this will go straight to the burn address. For the other 50%, these burn tax will be on hold for a period of n days on a smart contract. After n days has elapsed, the total amount will be transferred for distribution as a reward.

For those who comply consistently with the 1.2% off-chain burn tax, a reward will be given, with the funds coming from the rewards pool. This is the 50% of the total amount gathered from CEX who are not implementing the off-chain burn. The computation of the rewards given will be based on their % of the burn from the total amount burn for the past n days.

If only one exchange implements the 1.2% off-chain Burn Tax, that exchange will take the whole reward pool. This will encourage all the exchanges to start implementing the off-chain tax to take advantage of the reward. This will also encourage LUNC holders to support exchanges that supports the off-chain burn. If all the exchanges will comply, then no one will be punished, however, everyone will be rewarded because we will achieve our common goal on decreasing the total Terra Luna Classic supply.

"Automatic re-staking function with burn option

I think we need more options. Why don't we install an automatic payout of the staking reward by setting when it is paid out and what happens with the payout. For example 50% burn and 50% staking again. That way the community can easily influence the rate and burn speed...About this option could be installed a counter that shows the actual daily burning rate. Thus, the rate would not be 1.2% but at least 1.2% + the variable rate by all deposits. This would certainly be very motivating for investors.

I think we can build on that. The burning of the staking rewards could become a catalyst. More staking = more burning and less circulating supply. Investors would have more influence on the price, which will certainly be attractive. Important here is a display of the actual burn rate on the on chain volume. This would be variable and would motivate the community to burn more.

Based on this proposal, it could also be shown how the rate of the fraction to be burned from staking rewards increases the burn rate. It could be calculated how much staking rewards are burned in the mentioned period. Also the share of the community over a period of time could be variably determined and displayed. The whole thing would motivate the community to stake more and burn more. Also the validators could determine and display their share variably.

"Funding developer rewards for make 100's project on luna classic network

To compare the Luna classic coin to a state, it was devastated by the invasion of the enemy. The king abandoned his country, and he is being chased by another country.
The people are starting to clean up the ruins one by one, and are working hard to rebuild the country. They haven't lost hope, and other countries that have seen it are going to aid.
But in order for the nation to function properly, it needs to have an army, a hospital, a shopping center, and numerous cultural facilities. This is essential if you don't want Luna Classic coins to just end with meme coins.
If community members are citizens, dApp developers are professionals.
Many of the projects that were going on before the country fell were moved to other communities such as the Polygon. We need to bring back professionals who have fled the war to other countries.
But they won't take on uncertain challenges as they suffer from hardships of life. We need to provide a solid incentive for them to work in the Luna Classic ecosystem. 
It provides an opportunity for community's taxes or fundraising to be used where appropriate. And that choice is also up to the community.
Several CEXs including Binance support the burn of the Luna Classic Coin. But the point is not to create a short-term price pump. We have to make a useful blockchain network.
Many blockchain developers should be encouraged to voluntarily participate in the development of the Luna Classic network, and many participants should be encouraged to use LUNC on-chain rather than on exchanges.
I suggest the introduction of On-chain Decentralized Crypto crowding.
My proposal has the following advantages:

- Activation of on-chain liquidity
- dApp developers can work without struggling with their lives
- You can see in advance how popular your project is
- dApp developers can dramatically save on marketing costs
- Many developers within the ecosystem can come together with motivation
- Funders generate high expected returns through initial investment in promising projects
- Funders can check the progress of the project transparently (consistent with the philosophy of the blockchain)
- More and more LUNC coins will be burned due to on-chain transaction activation

"Cancellation or reduction of the undelegation period in order to speed up the burning

Summary
The introduction of a 1.2% tax on all transactions on-chain is in itself an unprecedented action. We can’t count on other projects because such an experience doesn’t exist. Now, we can confidently state that the tax introduction, as expected, has led to significant drop in amount of chain transactions. The drop itself requires to take retaliatory measures.

Motivation
At the moment, we can highlight just two main directions of on-chain transactions because of insufficiently branched blockchain infrastructure:

1) Movements of funds from CEXs to cold wallets to provide security;
2) Movements of funds from CEXs to the staking pool for profit-making purposes.

For most investors, the imposition of a 1.2% tax is enough reason to neglect security and keep funds in hot wallets of CEXs. Unfortunately we can’t help it. Another issue is staking conditions with which we can and should work.

The undelegation period in usual conditions (free from taxes) serves as a deterrent to keep a considerable amount of coins out of the market. In our case, the tax itself acts as a deterrent, but a long undelegation period prevents the inflow of a significant amount of funds from short-term investors into the staking pool from CEXs, and therefore, prevents efficient burning.

Understanding the psychology of the market, we can suggest that during FOMO period, a significant amount of funds from casual and short-term investors will flow from hot wallets of CEXs into the staking pool. During panic sale period we will observe the reverse situation. This will result in an increase in volatility, but in the first and second cases we will get a massive surge in the volume of transactions and an increased amount of burned coins accordingly. In the future, the rate of burning itself will be a factor that reduces volatility and the system will be finally compensated.

In addition to this, the circulation of coins in the staking pool leads:

1) Firstly, to an overall healthier on-chain;
2) Secondly, to a more natural distribution of coins between validators;
3) Finally, to a greater decentralization.
At the moment, this is as important as reducing the emission amount.

I understand that the proposed solution is non-standard but the situation we are in is also non-standard. We will not be able to achieve a significant reduction in emissions without taking radical steps.

Proposal
To cancell or reduce the undelegation period as much as possible.

"Proposal to prevent any/all future minting of Luna Classic

The excessive and unnecessary minting of Luna Classic was the catalyst that rapidly led to its spiraling downfall. If we are to breath life back into a project that was once doomed to be left forgotten, we cannot and must NOT repeat the failures of the past that led to this disaster.

It is beyond any level of understanding as to why or how minting more Luna Classic would help restore it. As a much needed reminder, there are still over 6.8 trillion coins in circulation and the collective efforts to burn for the past couple weeks have not had much or any weight in bringing down the supply. The introduction of 500 billion more coins would forever seal the fate of Luna Classic, that will lead to an avoidable second wave of despair. Should we be so haste to dismiss what occurred in early May of 2022 and repeat the same unforgettable failures of those who left the project as though it never existed?
Should we be so haste to forget how negatively many lives were impacted? 

Experimental tests can be left for other projects. This is no time for experiments, there is no room for experiments to this extreme. Vote wisely, as this is a proposal to implement preventative measures that would reject the creation of more Luna Classic. In other words, the purpose of this proposal is to vote on an implementation of code on-chain that would disallow minting even 1 more LUNC. We have tirelessly fought for weeks with votes and CEX's to implement the 1.2% burn. We have come so far and minting more coins is a backwards path from Luna Classic altogether.",0.11342480140245555
"Reduce Luna Classic Supply with a 1 for 3 Split

I am proposing as a method to reduce the total supply of Luna Classic that we implement a chain-wide coin split at a ratio of 1 for 3 split. In layman's terms, for every 3 Luna Classic on the blockchain that exists, 2 instantly disappear. 
Since the total amount of money that exists in the market does not change, this should result in the coins value to other currencies to triple, leaving all holders of Luna Classic coins with the same value held in their wallets.

"Add Ability To Deposit/Buy LUNC & USTC Directly On Terra Station ✅

TO VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL PLEASE VISIT: https://terraswvp.web.app
We all discuss bringing utility back to the chain, and that would be great to bring all old utility back to the classic chain. However, there is new utility that has already been added to the chain in the form of NFTs or gaming. There are a few future utility projects such as Lunatics token potentially bridging over to the classic chain. Currently, doing any business on-chain requires a middleman (CEX’s) to deposit/buy your LUNC. It would make everything 10 times easier to just buy their LUNC directly on Terra Station to stake, buy NFTs, buy other coins on the chain, etc. I propose that we add the ability to buy LUNC direct from terra station using a third-party payment platform such as Moonpay, Transak or even paypal. I am pretty sure that we would have to allocate coins to a LP wallet to fund the transactions, but no matter how it gets done, this would help transactions on chain to be a lot easier and happen more frequently. Thus, increasing the burns. Once This is passed, then we can figure out the logistics of getting this all to work. This should be step one to increasing on-chain volume for LUNC & USTC.

There should be a grace period if the staker decides to change the distribution rates again (this is just an example, 24 hours). If and when the tax rate changes again, the staker will be given an option to keep the distribution rates as is or they can schedule their rates to change with the new tax coming out. This scheduling idea will be sent to the stakers anywhere from 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month ahead of the tax change and will have a certain amount of time to respond to this notification. This portion should be handled by the developers to make sure the transition is smooth.

"Initiative to Increase Luna Classic Proposal Deposit Amount From 0 to 500,000 $LUNC & from 345,000 to 1,000,000 to initiate Voting Phase

This proposal aims to signal to TR & other notable bodies to work on a parameter change toward increasing the amount of LUNC needed to submit a governance proposal within Terra Classic governance.

We currently have a large issue where a large amount of individuals are submitting malicious proposals directing others toward scam websites / fake airdrops for LUNC. The issue being is that it currently only costs 0.01 LUNC to submit a proposal & while this is great for allowing many to submit proposals toward our blockchain it has also more often than not harmed individuals with these fake proposals.

We seek a simple fix of making it more expensive to submit a proposal so that we can either punish those making fake proposals or make sure that with this added cost individuals truly believe in what they're pushing out.

"Terra Expedition | An Ecosystem Expansion Program ✔️

More info: https://Terra2.info - The Terra Expedition is a revised iteration of the Developer Mining Program and Developer Alignment Program initially defined at the launch of the Terra blockchain. The original proposal suggested that 9.5% of the total LUNA supply be distributed based on TVL, but given the current state of the Terra ecosystem, TVL-based allocation would mainly benefit a few protocols and would not have the intended effect of kick-starting the Terra ecosystem. This revised proposal aims to better align incentives across the ecosystem and focus on attracting developers, onboarding users, and promoting deep liquidity. More info: https://Terra2.info 

Recap of Original Proposal More info: https://Terra2.info
Essential app developers committing to launch on Terra will receive:
[In process of distribution] Emergency allocation (0.5% of total supply): immediately after network launch to provide for runway while they build out product. Commit to returning funds if product has not been launched in 1 year. 
Developer Alignment Program (1.5% of total supply): Protocol teams that were live in Terra Classic divide this allocation weighted by the last 30 day TVL from Pre-attack snapshot - 1 year cliff, 3 year vesting thereafter. Accommodations will be made for apps where TVL is not applicable.
Developer Mining Program (8% of total supply): Essential app developers earn a share of the mining program proceeds pro-rata to the amount of TVL every quarter for 4 years. More info: https://Terra2.info",0.9997833132798388

Based on our volume which is around 3B $ (last 24h) at the moment if we implemented only 3% burn tax on each buy and sell transaction we could burn around 300,000,000,000 LUNA at the time of writing this proposal (I took price of 0.0003).

The arbitrage algorithm works. Allow people en mass to buy UST from the market, and convert each UST into $1 worth of LUNA (how ever many that may be.) sell the LUNA for its equivalent value.

buy 100UST for $5 (1ust=$.05)
Trade 100UST for 1000 LUNA (1luna=$.10)
(each UST is treated as though it is 1USD in the trade) 
Through this the demand for the LUNA exchange ratio goes up, and the demand for the convertibility of UST goes up. 
The opportunity cost for selling UST under $1 will be too high, and the risk of loss associated with selling LUNA under $1 will be too high.

BURN LUNA is nothing but usless if UST dosent recover the pairiority 1-1 (EVEN if UST recover the 1-1 we need UST  in a 0,5+ in his favor against the USD). SO if you DO NOT WANT THE FORK OF LUNA there is 3 options/plans that could be ""functionals""

2- Avoid the Fork, and make a ""big chain update"" DELETING  the""pair sistem"" also you can apply a ""2 years cliff"" to the ""new holders"" (speculators) (just like the new plan of FORKING LUNA ) eg : if in some  (NEW/ POST ATTACK) wallet are +300.000 $LUNA that wallet WILL be have  is founds frezzed (20% unlocked at the ""new update"" 70% vested over 2 years thereafter with 6 month cliff and 5% deliver to the cominity pool and 5% ininvesteament to anchor).

"Investigate Do Kwon For Fraudulent Activity Leading Up To The Terra's Fall

On April 30, a meeting was convened between Do Kwon and Terra's rich shareholders (better known as ""whales""). What was so strange about this meeting wasn't that it capped off a spending spree -- where the Luna Foundation Guard bought BTC with inflated UST and LUNA assets -- it was that it directly preceded the dissolution of both arms of Terraform Labs Corporation in Korea, which happened ON THE SAME DAY OF KWON'S MEETING WITH TERRA SHAREHOLDERS. I first learned about this in an article published by Coindesk, but later confirmed it in a report by the South Korean newspaper Korea JoongAng Daily -- which made the claim after reviewing Supreme Court documents regarding the dissolution.


Besides defending the American investors who held LUNA & UST, I felt it was important to honor the 280,000 Korean investors in the Terra platform who have lost in excess of $40 billion USD on a project that was so clearly flawed from the beginning. Like many other LUNAtics, I guess I got carried away with the project and decided to overlook the red flags that are so visible now. All things stated, it is important for you to abandon this project immediately before you lose any more money. Korean police have launched an investigation against a Luna Foundation Guard employee who is said to have embezzled assets once the precipitous decline of LUNA and UST began.

- How can you allocate the LFG funds, which is supposed to be the actual Luna real value, and the reason why investors put their rely on Luna, to your new Blockchain Project ?
Since there is no fork, your new Blockchain is a third partie project, we don't feel concerned about your plans, so don't touch Luna, neither its funds.

I propose to keep the entire ecosystem as it is to avoid inconvenience to all involved. I mean brokers, protocols and partners. I have no way to measure the volume of effort to make a fork, but what I know in SAP gives you an idea ;-D.
By the way, I reinforce that I am a FreeBSD user here at home... we would say that I have some knowledge... So, following the steps of the UST 2.0 process

1) Creation of the Entity (TFF) Talked with Governments (authoritative) I want to be a partner of the Holding....
2) Creation and management of the TFF, GLUNA or LUNAC governance token, as you wish... this token must have a parity greater than the dollar by at least 20%, LUNAC = (a basket of assets)
3) Disable LUNA from the current UST coining engine.
4) Keep LUNA as a capitalizer and avoid inconveniences such as contracts and etc... I don't even want to get into this detail that wears out too much. Keep and avoid headaches for everyone.
5) Burn Do Kwon 40%'s wallet and everyone involved who had the mouse idea to sell less BTC than he bought, could have borrowed on him and mitigate the leak.
6) Raise the price of LUNA to at least 2 USD, it will help a lot... in the minting of the new UST2.0.
7) Stop playing with other people's patience and prevent me from taking a plane to Korea and solving this issue myself...

With the passing of proposal 5234, there will be a portion of the seigniorage redirected to the community pool at the end of every epoch. With the influx of new resources, it is critical that the community spend the funding with wisdom, transparency, and efficiency. Historic methods of distribution (“trust me, bro”) are insufficient with no accountability, nor is there any established peer review process in the distribution nor oversight in the use of grant funding.

Current methods of community pool distribution have not been adequately formulated. Historic methods of community pool spending have suffered from a myriad of problems including, nepotism, centralization, poor transparency, lack of accountability, and lack of direction. A grants program with independent reviews of the proposed contributions of a project, group, or developer team will attract new talent, evaluate proposals on merit (not who you know), while providing funding for the delivery of specific milestones. Furthermore, a pay by milestone model will provide enough seed capital for the project to get started, and incentivize the completion of that project or proposal.

*This grants program does not prevent the submission of any community pool distribution on its own. This program aims to be the recommended method to request a grant due to the oversight, peer review, and rationale described above.

"Signaling Proposal: LUNC Requests Osmosis Support the Burn Tax

This proposal is meant to gauge overall community interest in Osmosis implementing support for off-chain tax collection and remittance following the upcoming reconnection of the Osmosis/LUNC IBC channel. That is to say, do we collectively wish for Osmosis to support the burn off-chain? What we are asking for from Osmosis: We are signaling to Osmosis that the LUNC community wishes for the burn to be implemented on the Osmosis DEX to both LUNC & USTC. To incentivize Osmosis to support the tax off-chain, we propose that the following burn-revenue share structure: 90% of the collected tax is to be sent back to Terra and into the burn wallet (terra1sk06e3dyexuq4shw77y3dsv480xv42mq73anxu), the remaining 10% shall be sent to the Osmosis Community Pool or a smart contract solely controlled by their governance mechanism. The 10% allocated to the Osmosis Community Pool shall be both the payment for ensuring that the tax is faithfully collected on an ongoing on Osmosis. How this can be accomplished: The creation of a coin/token agnostic & governance controlled burn module that allows for Osmosis DEX to place a % base premium on any coin/token on their DEX, via governance vote. The premium can be placed to the front and back end of swaps on their DEX in order to avoid de-stabilizing their uniquely hard coded liquidity pool structures. The coins collected would then be sent to an Osmosis smart contract that will then send the coins to back to Terra and into the burn wallet and also into the Osmosis Community Pool at 90% to 10% basis as discussed above. Prior to the crash, Terra and Osmosis enjoyed a deep relationship, with Osmosis being Terra’s primary non-CEX, off-chain source of liquidity, which allowed LUNA holders to access deep liquidity pools and sophisticated yield farming strategies. In turn, LUNA provided the Osmosis liquidity providers with a rich stream of swap fees. Our devs were friends and co-mingled. Now that LUNC is emerging from the shadows of the crash, we are once again on the cusp of reigniting our relationship with Osmosis and our devs are now once again forging friendships with one another, coming together as part of a greater collective ecosystem. LUNC Community, we must be willing to work with our counterparts within the greater Cosmos ecosystem to ensure that the tax is supported on as many off-chain platforms as can be reasonably accomplished. Join me in signaling to Osmosis that we wish for them to implement our tax on their own native DEX. To further show Osmosis that this is truly what the LUNC community wants feel free to tweet “@osmosiszone #OsmosisBurnLUNC”. ",0.0072454646028699

"Joint L1 Task Force

In recognition of the maintenance updates required for the Luna Classic blockchain, I propose that the Luna Classic community contract several experienced blockchain developers to complete the required updates to upgrade and stabilize the L1 layer. At the height of Terra, Terraform Labs had a team of 6-8 senior L1 blockchain developers. With this level of support, developers could focus on innovation in addition to security and maintenance. Given our current situation, as well as severe budget constraints, I am proposing that we budget to hire the equivalent of 3 full time L1 blockchain developers to focus primarily on essential maintenance upgrades to be completed in the next 4-6 months. Upon the successful stability upgrades, the development team would transition to more innovative and long term advancements.

The proposed team of individuals would be three members of the community that have significantly contributed to the L1 layer in the past 7 months, specifically Tobias, Ed, and Till, with invaluable contributions from Notional Labs (Jacob Gadikian’s group).

Set wars of this type are a net-negative for the chain, since they negatively impact and diminish the currently active validator stack, and thus ought to be prevented.

"Optional Feature # 2 - Separate Burn Wallet Exempt from Seigniorage (Binance Request 2/2)

While seigniorage has been “turned off”, there is no guarantee that it could not be changed in the future. Thus, Binance has requested that a separate burn wallet be created where any LUNC manually sent to this burn wallet, be excluded from the seigniorage remint calculation done at the end of every epoch. Basically, any LUNC sent to this wallet is burned, and stays burned. This second burn wallet will be publicized and could be used by anyone in the community for this purpose. The second governance proposal is seeking consensus around the creation of this second burn wallet.   Please note that you are not voting on a particular piece of code at this time, but rather whether or not you want to see these features included in the next release.

"Optional Feature # 3 - Burn Tax Split to Community Pool

This is the third and final optional feature we are seeking consensus upon in the next release. Previously, the community utilized the seigniorage RewardWeight parameter to remint a portion of the burned supply to the community pool. This was confusing to many people in the community. The third governance proposal is seeking consensus around the creation of a new parameter that does not utilize the seigniorage remint policy, but has an independent ability to directly send a percentage of the on-chain tax to the community pool. The initialization of this parameter will be 10% community pool, 90% burn as noted in governance proposal #11111, which was the consensus before the Binance requests to turn off seigniorage (and are being alternatively handled by feature #2). Please note that you are not voting on a particular piece of code at this time, but rather whether or not you want to see these features included in the next release.

"Q2 Joint L1 Task Force Proposal with Amendments

During the first quarter of 2023 the Joint L1 Task Force completed several large-scale upgrades for the Luna Classic blockchain. These included v1.0.5 hotfix, v1.1.0, and v2.0.0 (v2.0.0 release candidate was released on March 31st). The v2.0.0 upgrade is a major blockchain upgrade containing upgrades to Cosmos SDK v0.45.13 and Tendermint v34.24, and will be deployed in the columbus-5 mainnet through a chain-halt upgrade in late April.

Given a successful first quarter, it is proposed that the L1 Task Force receives a Q2 mandate to continue development on the blockchain, and complete the development work which has largely already been completed. In Q2 the L1 Task Force will focus on extensive testing for the v2.0.0 upgrade and building out the testnet, and deploy v2.1.0, bringing the blockchain to parity with other cosmos blockchains.

Primary Benefits anticipated by the End of Q2:

- Upgraded Cosmos SDK and Tendermint environment
- Minimum deposit on governance to prevent scam proposals (Minimum initial - deposit for deposit proposals)
- Parity with other Cosmos blockchains
- Fee Sharing incentive feature for smart contract developers *Activation of feature dependent on separate governance approval
- Options for bridging cross-chain liquidity assessed
- Station on-ramp investigation and completed proof of concept

After internal discussion, the team feels we only require one junior developer on an as-needed basis (discretionary budget) for this quarter to meet our objectives, as such the community proposal ask has been adjusted accordingly.

"LUNC Listing On Mars Protocol (SIGNAL)

I am pleased to submit a proposal to signal for the addition of LUNC to the Red Bank within the Mars Protocol as an addition to our development team's roadmap. This proposal includes an initial deposit cap of 25 Billion LUNC, and asks that the Terra Classic community adhere to the Red Bank risk frameworks outlined in the Agorra text for an initial deposit listing request and future deposit cap increases.

Other credit protocols within the cosmos also require similar risk frameworks for listings in the future and adhering to these standards will allow us to qualify for not only a listing within the Mars Protocol but other future cosmos lending protocols as well, and will have the added benefit of lowering the circulating supply.

The purpose of this proposal is to provide new economic incentivization for LUNC holders, additional interest rate models, and cross-cosmos synergies. By listing LUNC on the RedBank, we as a community can offer significant potential for the growth and development of the Terra Classic community and credit protocols within the cosmos.

I encourage the community to refer to the Agorra text, linked below, for additional information on the proposed listing of LUNC on the Mars Protocol. This proposal indicates the communities intent to have a significant impact on 
participating in the future of interblockchain e-commerce defi loan protocols such as the Red Bank and possibly many more.

"[1/4] Split Burn Tax with Distribution Module

v1.1.0 modified the burn AnteHandler to split the Burn tax to the Community Pool. Rather than this, I propose to modify the burn AnteHandler to split the Burn tax to the Distribution Module (terra1jv65s3grqf6v6jl3dp4t6c9t9rk99cd8pm7utl) instead. Why? Because the distribution module already splits 50% of the proceeds with the CP. By splitting the burn tax with the distribution module instead of the CP, stakers also stand to benefit, thus creating a broader alignment with the community and increasing demand for staking and for LUNC.

"[3/4] Increase the Burn tax to 0.5%

As we focus on increasing LUNC demand via staking, we also need to focus on reducing LUNC supply via burn tax. Why 0.5%? Burn Tax is a form of Currency Transaction Taxes 2 such as Tobin Tax. While financial transaction tax rates of the magnitude of 0.1%-1% have been proposed by normative economists, James Tobin himself had suggested a rate of 0.5% in an interview.

"Promote Chain Utility via the Establishment of the Terra Grants Program

With the passing of proposal 5234, there will be a portion of the seigniorage redirected to the community pool at the end of every epoch. With the influx of new resources, it is critical that the community spend the funding with wisdom, transparency, and efficiency. Historic methods of distribution (“trust me, bro”) are insufficient with no accountability, nor is there any established peer review process in the distribution nor oversight in the use of grant funding.

Current methods of community pool distribution have not been adequately formulated. Historic methods of community pool spending have suffered from a myriad of problems including, nepotism, centralization, poor transparency, lack of accountability, and lack of direction. A grants program with independent reviews of the proposed contributions of a project, group, or developer team will attract new talent, evaluate proposals on merit (not who you know), while providing funding for the delivery of specific milestones. Furthermore, a pay by milestone model will provide enough seed capital for the project to get started, and incentivize the completion of that project or proposal.

website terragrantsfoundation.org

*This grants program does not prevent the submission of any community pool distribution on its own. This program aims to be the recommended method to request a grant due to the oversight, peer review, and rationale described above.
**The grants program does not actually fund anything, just collects proposals, organizes independent reviews, makes recommendations via these reviews, and keeps projects accountable. All community spend proposals still need to go through governance and voting by the community.

To incentivize Osmosis to support the tax off-chain, we propose that the following burn-revenue share structure: 90% of the collected tax is to be sent back to Terra and into the burn wallet (terra1sk06e3dyexuq4shw77y3dsv480xv42mq73anxu), the remaining 10% shall be sent to the Osmosis Community Pool or a smart contract solely controlled by their governance mechanism. The 10% allocated to the Osmosis Community Pool shall be both the payment for ensuring that the tax is faithfully collected on an ongoing on Osmosis. How this can be accomplished: The creation of a coin/token agnostic & governance controlled burn module that allows for Osmosis DEX to place a % base premium on any coin/token on their DEX, via governance vote. The premium can be placed to the front and back end of swaps on their DEX in order to avoid de-stabilizing their uniquely hard coded liquidity pool structures. The coins collected would then be sent to an Osmosis smart contract that will then send the coins to back to Terra and into the burn wallet and also into the Osmosis Community Pool at 90% to 10% basis as discussed above. Prior to the crash, Terra and Osmosis enjoyed a deep relationship, with Osmosis being Terra’s primary non-CEX, off-chain source of liquidity, which allowed LUNA holders to access deep liquidity pools and sophisticated yield farming strategies. In turn, LUNA provided the Osmosis liquidity providers with a rich stream of swap fees. Our devs were friends and co-mingled. Now that LUNC is emerging from the shadows of the crash, we are once again on the cusp of reigniting our relationship with Osmosis and our devs are now once again forging friendships with one another, coming together as part of a greater collective ecosystem. LUNC Community, we must be willing to work with our counterparts within the greater Cosmos ecosystem to ensure that the tax is supported on as many off-chain platforms as can be reasonably accomplished. Join me in signaling to Osmosis that we wish for them to implement our tax on their own native DEX. To further show Osmosis that this is truly what the LUNC community wants feel free to tweet “@osmosiszone #OsmosisBurnLUNC”. ",0.0072454646028699

Rebel Station is hosted and fully-managed by Terra Rebels, but still relies on significant parts of TFL’s back-end assets/infrastructure. Terra Rebels therefore propose that we must urgently perform work to separate the Rebel Station from TFL. This work has the following components:

* Provision of backend infrastructure and assets on TR controlled hosting
* Refactor Rebel Station frontend to reference TR backend assets and infrastructure
* Remove TFL proprietary private APIs, reverse engineer, and create local alternatives
* Testing and deployment

"Joint L1 Task Force

In recognition of the maintenance updates required for the Luna Classic blockchain, I propose that the Luna Classic community contract several experienced blockchain developers to complete the required updates to upgrade and stabilize the L1 layer. At the height of Terra, Terraform Labs had a team of 6-8 senior L1 blockchain developers. With this level of support, developers could focus on innovation in addition to security and maintenance. Given our current situation, as well as severe budget constraints, I am proposing that we budget to hire the equivalent of 3 full time L1 blockchain developers to focus primarily on essential maintenance upgrades to be completed in the next 4-6 months. Upon the successful stability upgrades, the development team would transition to more innovative and long term advancements.

The proposed team of individuals would be three members of the community that have significantly contributed to the L1 layer in the past 7 months, specifically Tobias, Ed, and Till, with invaluable contributions from Notional Labs (Jacob Gadikian’s group). The concrete L1 developments delivered (in-part or whole) by this team include re-enable staking, re-enable delegation, parameterized on-chain burn tax, re-enable IBCs, and dragonberry exploit patch. Additional support on parameter chain updates, relayers, CEX coordination, innovative chain proposals, and community educational materials have also been delivered by these individuals.

Through accepting this proposal the community agrees on removing taxes for IBC assets. This means that whenever a taxable transaction (tx) is issued then the IBC assets inside the send-amount field of the tx remain untaxed. However, the Terra Classic native assets (such as LUNC and various whitelisted stablecoins) remain taxed according to the chains taxation parameters.

IBC assets are assets that where minted by the bank module due to an IBC transaction bridging a native asset from another chain to Terra Classic.

Set wars of this type are a net-negative for the chain, since they negatively impact and diminish the currently active validator stack, and thus ought to be prevented.

Binance has requested that the internal movement between Binance owned wallets be exempt from the burn tax (currently set to 0.2%). A list of Binance owned wallets has been provided to the community via the above announcement. It was confirmed with Binance that movement to and from Binance wallets will still be taxed. This means deposits and withdrawals are not exempt, but rather only the internal movements between wallets will be exempt for their internal security purposes. This first governance proposal is seeking consensus around this request from Binance.

"Q2 Joint L1 Task Force Proposal with Amendments

During the first quarter of 2023 the Joint L1 Task Force completed several large-scale upgrades for the Luna Classic blockchain. These included v1.0.5 hotfix, v1.1.0, and v2.0.0 (v2.0.0 release candidate was released on March 31st). The v2.0.0 upgrade is a major blockchain upgrade containing upgrades to Cosmos SDK v0.45.13 and Tendermint v34.24, and will be deployed in the columbus-5 mainnet through a chain-halt upgrade in late April.

Given a successful first quarter, it is proposed that the L1 Task Force receives a Q2 mandate to continue development on the blockchain, and complete the development work which has largely already been completed. In Q2 the L1 Task Force will focus on extensive testing for the v2.0.0 upgrade and building out the testnet, and deploy v2.1.0, bringing the blockchain to parity with other cosmos blockchains.

Primary Benefits anticipated by the End of Q2:

- Upgraded Cosmos SDK and Tendermint environment
- Minimum deposit on governance to prevent scam proposals (Minimum initial - deposit for deposit proposals)
- Parity with other Cosmos blockchains
- Fee Sharing incentive feature for smart contract developers *Activation of feature dependent on separate governance approval
- Options for bridging cross-chain liquidity assessed
- Station on-ramp investigation and completed proof of concept

After internal discussion, the team feels we only require one junior developer on an as-needed basis (discretionary budget) for this quarter to meet our objectives, as such the community proposal ask has been adjusted accordingly.

"LUNC Listing On Mars Protocol (SIGNAL)

I am pleased to submit a proposal to signal for the addition of LUNC to the Red Bank within the Mars Protocol as an addition to our development team's roadmap. This proposal includes an initial deposit cap of 25 Billion LUNC, and asks that the Terra Classic community adhere to the Red Bank risk frameworks outlined in the Agorra text for an initial deposit listing request and future deposit cap increases.

Other credit protocols within the cosmos also require similar risk frameworks for listings in the future and adhering to these standards will allow us to qualify for not only a listing within the Mars Protocol but other future cosmos lending protocols as well, and will have the added benefit of lowering the circulating supply.

The purpose of this proposal is to provide new economic incentivization for LUNC holders, additional interest rate models, and cross-cosmos synergies. By listing LUNC on the RedBank, we as a community can offer significant potential for the growth and development of the Terra Classic community and credit protocols within the cosmos.

Since LFG ,Do Kwon and Co will focus on the new Luna we want to focus on Luna Classic with people who wishes to participate on that project hence we also would like to get the possibility to vote for our own validators/deligators and take part on Luna Classic governance

Please remember when staking is re-enabled people can start staking again and delegete their vote/voice to validators who represent their opinion.

"Saving Terra Luna and cryptocurrencies

To all of us who believe and invest in this project we must not settle for something that could be unfair. That position could be wrong because here we talk about a possible scam, even technical negligence of the project, losing money in a bad investment is understood that it is necessary to accept it but this case is unique and it is not to keep their arms crossed by accepting that they remain with Your money or simply assuming the error that does not correspond to you. I have lost money with bad investments but I repeat this case is unique and gives to talk much more during the time, even there is possible that there is fair compensation or fair resolution so that we can move forward with the project.

We are talking about a coin that looked unbeatable, located in the first places, not a common cryptocurrency that you could buy to try luck .. That is what I want to make clear.

 If you return what you invested or transfer it to you in another currency but with the value of our investment it would be the most fair.

We are talking about the future of cryptocurrencies, Luna will strongly affect if there is no fair solution that allows people to invest without distrust.

We must be responsible in these types of situations and that there are no way to drift, trust is what this ecosystem would work bireitely.

I worry about affected and how they will be compensated, that is what anyone who wants to invest in cryptos would look before. I repeat trust is what makes this ecosystem work.

The basic idea of this proposal is to help UST repegging mechanism work again and bring back our healthy classic network ecosystem.

Which means, the UST repegging system will never work well. So what I'm advising is that adjust the maximum mint rate of Lunc per day to match the total supply, like in 1 percent of total supply or higher. I know this could be implemented by algorithm.

Immediately UST would be massively printed in order to meet the new demand, and in doing so $LUNC would be burned in equal proportion.

"Financially viable buy and burn / Restore network governance

***TDLR: Let’s buy back and burn 6B UST + 6.498T LUNC by paying 130M$ today and 400M LUNC tokens later when price hits 30$. It is possible to buy back and burn for cheap and for UST holders to recover at least 0.60$ per USD***

https://agora.terra.money/t/proposal-a-financially-viable-lunc-proposal/42722

======================================================

1. Allow UST holders to recover at least 0.60$ per UST

2. Restore network governance

3. After the buy back and burn we go back to a 2B supply of LUNC tokens only - no more USTs

4. We need to buy tokens back and burn them before doing anything else otherwise the network is not safe to use: https://medium.com/tgradefinance/when-the-tide-goes-out-we-see-who-is-wearing-a-swimming-costume-3ebd5f4d6127

5. Without the buy back, Luna Classic will simply be a pump and d_mp token as no builder will want to join since it will be possible to steal assets from the network. So no DEFi, no pools, no borrow lending, no NFTs etc. It is a pitty because there are many Apps readily available to use.

6. After the price reaches 30$ UST holders get 200M LUNC token for a total value of 6B$

7. After the price reaches 30$ UST whales get 200M LUNC token for a total value of 6B$

8. Main advantage of using options is that it lowers the cost of the buy back: At current market price it would cost around 650M to buy all the supply. But then as you buy price will increase so really cost of buy back will be more in the Billions USD. With options, we're buying back at 6B$ but we only need 130M$ today: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)

9. We could simply say UST holders get 200M LUNC tokens unlocking when price hits 30$. But with options they could sell before, if someone is willing to buy the options, some UST holders might be happy to sell and move on. With locked tokens..you're locked

10. How we redistribute the new supply (600M tokens) is up to the community

11. Works with other burns in place (from exchange fees etc.)

"Accelerating LUNC Burns

The main aim of this proposal is to burn more LUNC. In my opinion, the contribution of each validator in the burning of LUNC should be determined. In front of the name of each validator, it should be specified what percentage of its own interest/commission rates has been allocated to burning LUNC whether with a 1% commission or a 5% or a 10% or whatsoever. As “Voting Power” and “Commission” rows, a new row should be added something like “Commission Burned” or “CBurned” or “CB”.
It will have the following consequences: 
1-Allows delegators to choose better validators for delegating.
2-Encourages LUNC validators to burn more of this coin.
3-Much more of this coin will be burned.
4-Voting power is distributed among validators in a more appropriate way.
5-Becomes a better decentralized chain.

This proposal is more of a message 
 
Either vote yes to agree with my thinking or 




no veto I’d like to burn it or have it be heard ❤️




From following everything 
Lunc is great shape and health even with all news circulating
Ustc will continue to work towards $1 on its own and supporting and holding I think is necessary




Would it be possible to implement a system to limit shorts? In general if this was my baby that I built i wouldn’t appreciate it but I total understand it’s necessary 




This is something the lunc token would inherit using burnt coins of some new mechanic, new wallet that would be used on daily case randomly to create some randomness but only once every 24 hour period. So technically when the mechanic hit at 1st 11:59pm  and then again at 2nd 12:01 am then mechanic would hit between 3rd 12:01am-11:59pm - with accumulation technically from the 2d 12:02am -11:59pm adding to the 3rds amount because it’s just waiting for the programming to work but hey big one coming up




The mechanic would use some grid funds or some of tax maybe a combination of both, but I know digging into the tax is unliked but I think it’s worth the idea. not a lot could start of minimal and then experimented with on random days 




At the end of the day all assets will still be burnt, a buying bot but griding first before burning, token sent to this wallet will get put into a grid to stabilize price and each tax would cover a different area(would only burn once the price returns the original entry price or higher, if lower it becomes a holding bot, the lender is the station in house to increase network usage constantly 




Also have NFT album sidelined privatized that if anyone looking to contact for a collaboration 🙌 been waiting for the network I wanted to have them built on

"Expanded & Finalized L1 Task Force [v3] (Q2, 2023)

To fill the senior leadership gap left by the departure of Prof. Ed Kim and the removal of Mr. Tobias Andersen, we propose bringing in Bilbo Baggins (senior software engineer/architect) and Solid Snake (another senior engineer and systems architect), both of whom will serve as team co-leads. In addition to them, we propose adding another 3 senior developers to the team (NotJoshC, MangoChutney, ChopstickSensei) all of whom are seasoned developers with years of experience under their belts, and will have no trouble fitting into the group. Finally, we propose adding Jacob Gadikian (senior developer and CEO of Notional Labs) to this roster as a retainer, for the purpose of external collaboration and high-level overview (code review and Cosmos-specific implementation), as Jacob has already contributed much to the blockchain and his expertise will prove invaluable in helping us reach parity.

We need to scale up our L1 team if we are to prepare LUNC for the coming bull run!

Ergo, here is the proposed budget for Q2:

$7,500/month for Bilbo Baggins x 3 months = $22,500 overall for Q2
$7,500/month for SolidSnake x 3 months = $22,500 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for NotJoshC x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for MangoChutney x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for ChopstickSensei x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for Jacob Gadikian x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2

Total expenditure for Q2: $105,000, paid out in 2 installments!
(or 853,658,536.585365 LUNC at a conversion rate of 0.000123)

This money is to be paid out in 2 equal installments! If this proposal passes, the first installment would be released immediately upon the proposal’s passing so the work can commence. The second installment would be put up for a vote in its own prop after 8 weeks have passed, to allow the community to judge the work delivered over 2 months. This ensures the community pool is protected from a one-time drain, as well as incentivizes the developers with delayed payouts for completing their roadmap!

"VOTE to save on-chain funds stolen from Terraport

This proposal requests voters to vote to support an emergency code upgrade that will enable the temporary locking of approximately $2m of stolen funds to give Terraport time to find a more permanent solution. This patch will be removed once it has served its purpose. These stolen funds are from investors and users of Terraport that are recorded in tracked wallets which have been independently confirmed. This vote would be a step closer to helping investors get their funds returned. Time is absolutely of the essence. 

The full Agora text can be accessed here:
https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/save-on-chain-funds-stolen-from-terraport/51392

Binance are coordinating the investigation into this attack with the authorities. In the UK the authorities informed are the Police and NFIB. Feel free to consult with them. Binance, Simpleswap, MEXC and Kucoin have already collectively frozen approximately £1m of funds in wallets off chain and we expect them to be returned in due course. 

This proposal has been discussed by Validators for nearly a week in the “oldguard-secured” channel of the TerraClassic Validator discord that is used for emergency action. Only about 10% of validator VP voted indicatively in a vote regarding this. 

By locking these funds, it prevents the thieves from moving them off chain and the risk of them being permanently lost. Every minute these are not locked gives the attackers a chance to move them. It also tells criminals that we will stand up for what is right and not sit back and let them get away with stolen funds when it is in our power to prevent this.
 
If the vote is passed and the funds are locked, we will then consult with the community and present a proposal on how to go about returning the funds to the Terraport liquidity pool. We have chosen to use separate proposals to prevent any lack of focus on this specific proposal which is itself an unprecedented temporary emergency measure for Terra Classic.

We appreciate there may be strong emotions regarding this proposal and we welcome all constructive debate from all sides of the community.",0.8497022960705305
"Vote of “No Confidence” for the Current L1 Team

Given the recent addition of an unsanctioned backdoor code into LUNC's GitHub repo by the L1 team that enables centralized censoring of transactions, it has became obvious that they are brazenly ignoring governance. This is a proposal that no-one had ever hoped to have been writen as it asks to remove the current L1 team from their positions, via a ""No Confidence"" vote.  They disobey the chain's protocols, act of their own accord behind closed doors, blatantly ignore the spirit of crypto, violate defi ethos, and do all of it while working behind the scenes on initiatives and projects which were neither sanctioned nor requested by the wider LUNC community that pays their salaries! To put it bluntly, they've committed far too many strikes in just a bit over the week they've been on their Q2 job, culminating in an egregrious violation of trust by contributing to an attempt to slide in wallet and transaction blacklisting functionality controlled by a single multisig without having any sort of prior consultation with the community. Severe actions require severe consequences, and an example needs to be made so that a precedent is set so that these types of actions aren't tried again. A message needs to be sent that this behaviour will not be tolerated in any way, shape, or form, from anyone in this community.

"Compound Burns

This is a signal for someone with coding knowledge and better resources than myself to flesh out this concept based on the sentiment of this proposal.

We need new ways to burn, and we are leaving out one of the most powerful tools that we already have established. The power of compound interest.

This idea motions to redirect the LUNC burns away from the current burn wallet and into a new one that has the ability to delegate to a specific delegator.

This delegator will have to be created with the sole purpose of administering the staking rewards of the newly created burn wallet. It must abstain from any and all voting.

Staking rewards earned by the new burn wallet will compound into the delegator once per month.

There may need to be a kill code included that triggers once a certain amount is held in order to prevent a permanent strain on the community rewards distribution. This can be based on either LUNC held or LUNC value.

Institutions involved in the burn tax will be encouraged to direct their burns to this new system, allowing their burns to be amplified exponentially through the power of compouding.

Again, this is just a concept. I do not have the ability to code this myself. This proposal serves as a signal for someone with the proper resources to create.",0.6549596761007633

2. A complete list of the monthly salaries for all TGF employees/administrators/anyone affiliated with TGF who received Community Pool funds.

3. Clarification regarding Allnodes employee Jagmot’s relationship with TGF. To what degree is Jagmot involved in TGF’s decision making process?

4. Whether TGF pays Marco Ferreira and LuncBurnArmy separately from their authorized JL1TF spending proposal salaries.

5. Whether TGF has a private retainer with Horizons Law.

6. A list of TGF’s approved grantees and their related projects. 

7. Clarification whether the IRS is in contact with TGF. If so, TGF will post said communications to Agora for community discussion.

8. Clarification of who owns TGF and what specific role Ed Kim occupies within the organization.

"$USTC↔️$INRT↔️$USDTR Repeg & $LUNC Revival Plan/Proposal

Although this proposal began primarily as a $USTC Repeg Plan, it has now developed into what I can safely call a Terra Luna Classic Technical Recovery Plan using a methodological high-level technical design and architecture which makes the blockchain useful again for payments, arbitrage/trading opportunities as well as for long-term holders of $LUNC who wish to see their holdings profit from reducing the supply substantially over the next 1-2 years and not 87 years (as calculated using the current burn rate which has reduced further after this calculation was done).

Voting YES on this Proposal:-

1. Places Terra Luna Classic on the map of DeFi projects once again by introducing a high-level technical architecture of a trading system in which all currencies on the Terra Luna Classic blockchain, including $LUNC, is being properly used as DeFi coins

2. Burns supply of $LUNC, $USTC and other de-pegged Terra-Luna stablecoins directly by enabling trades/swaps/arbitrages between currencies
Introduces a correctly pegged stablecoin to the ecosystem before $USDC becomes the default stablecoin of the Cosmos ecosystem/market

3. Re-enables the market swap functionality without touching any L1 core module code (since it is not required to do so after the introduction of WSTs)

4. Provides us with a Community DEX, transaction/gas fess of which will directly/indirectly go to the validators, delegators (Oracle Pool) and developers (Community Pool)

5. Excess reserves from our Reserve Pool (after balancing the Buffer Reserve Pool) will be completely used to burn $LUNC

6. Multiple macro and micro liquidity pools provide safety, security and much needed capital infusion to the Terra Luna Classic ecosystem

7. Provides a way to enter and exit the Terra Luna Classic DeFi system without the need to use a centralized exchange for trading/swapping/staking: our system would enable traders to deposit in $BTC/$ETH and also withdraw as BTC/$ETH, making it extremely convenient for anyone to invest into the various currencies, WSTs and even a stablecoin on the Terra Luna Classic ecosystem

8. Wrapped Stable Tokens are being introduced to the Terra Luna Classic ecosystem for the first time, probably, on any blockchain, which re-enables arbitrage trading between currencies

9. I AM the developer who is going to develop this entire system with minimal external help. I am directly reachable 24x7 via Agora, Discord, Telegram, Email and if required, on WhatsApp

10. I DO NOT require the help of the L1 Team to do my work and execute this plan end-to-end. I also do not require the help of other developers since I am a Senior Full Stack developer myself

NOTE:

I had originally posted the proposal for discussion here:

"No Canonical Repo for Terra Classic

This proposal aims to decentralize control over the LUNC codebase...

Terraform Labs were the original developers of the blockchain and used the github repository, https://github.com/terra-money 13 as the canonical repository for the Luna blockchain. After the de-peg event in May, the Terra Classic repo was created, https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core 26, but not actively maintained. Thus, any code changes by active developers in the ecosystem were subject to the approval of a centralized entity, whose focus had shifted to a different blockchain project. Until August 2022, the terra-money repository was still the authoritative repository.

Given that TFL was no longer actively working on the classic chain, community governance passed proposal 4940 and elected to change the canonical repository to the Terra Rebel’s classic repository, https://github.com/terra-rebels/classic-core 26. This repo was then archived and switched to https://github.com/terra-rebels/classic 11 due to an exploit found in the IBC code, known as Dragonberry.

However, at this time, we are facing a similar situation where a group of Terra Classic L1 developers are working on the blockchain, yet do not have write access to the current canonical repository, and are subject to the approval of a centralized entity. Given the decentralized nature of our blockchain, we are proposing that there be no canonical repository for Terra Classic. Thus, there is no one centralized entity or developer group that has default control over the code base. Guardianship of what code runs on the blockchain is solely in the hands of the active validator set.
In summary, we believe that this proposal offers two major benefits to the community. First, it decentralizes the developer validator relationship, allowing any competent developer group to contribute freely to the blockchain. Second, it inherently requires a second level of review from the validator set and community body. On the other hand, this does require extra effort and scrutiny on the part of the developers, validators, and community during the upgrade process.

Also cap the fee. Meaning either that percentage or a max of 10k LUNC

With the passing of proposal 5234, there will be a portion of the seigniorage redirected to the community pool at the end of every epoch. With the influx of new resources, it is critical that the community spend the funding with wisdom, transparency, and efficiency. Historic methods of distribution (“trust me, bro”) are insufficient with no accountability, nor is there any established peer review process in the distribution nor oversight in the use of grant funding.




Current methods of community pool distribution have not been adequately formulated. Historic methods of community pool spending have suffered from a myriad of problems including, nepotism, centralization, poor transparency, lack of accountability, and lack of direction. A grants program with independent reviews of the proposed contributions of a project, group, or developer team will attract new talent, evaluate proposals on merit (not who you know), while providing funding for the delivery of specific milestones. Furthermore, a pay by milestone model will provide enough seed capital for the project to get started, and incentivize the completion of that project or proposal.

"Use $4.16 Million Dollars Of The Community Off Chain Assets To Buy Back And Burn LUNC

Initially, during the capitulation Changpeng Zhao (CEO OF BINANCE) suggested that the community have a BUY BACK AND BURN initiative to stop the coin from plummeting in price. In this proposal we are suggesting that using funding from off chain assets to buy into the coin would increase the price of everyone's LUNC substantially and get the coin back closer to how the initial ecosystem operated in terms of supply. The whole community will benefit from this financially so there is little reason not to use the funding for this. If the community were to use the funds to buy LUNC then stake it, we would find ourselves draining the oracle rewards pool faster which would not be good.
So with this proposal as community member I am starting the #BUYBACKANDBURN initiative to help restore the terra ecosystem to original operations. If you support this movement please vote YES and share it with community members and validators. ",0.3678467956719271

"Incorporate a 5 Dollar Fee For All Transactions and Burn It

I believe that if we added a 5 dollar fee for each transaction and we burn that 5 dollars worth of lunc we will reach our goal of 1 dollar or more per terra luna classic token faster. 5 dollars is nothing more than a cup of coffee at Starbucks for most of us but for luna classic it could be worth much more. I also feel that this would be much more acceptable in the eyes of investors who may buy millions of dollars worth of lunc as 5 dollars is even less to them than what it is for regular traders such as myself who is risking 1,000,000 of my total 4.3mil tokens just to create this proposal. If we have 100,000 thousand transactions in a day and just 5 dollars per transaction is burnt at the price of 0.0002 that equals to 25,000 luna classic now if we times 25,000 by 100,000 that equals 2.5 billion tokens burnt during that day. Let's say the token loses a zero and becomes 0.001 that still equals 500million tokens burned for that day. I cannot find exactly how many transactions go through each day online anywhere but in the past we easily surpassed 100,000 transactions sometimes we even hit 1,000,000 transactions in a single day and if we happen to reach those numbers presently i believe we will have the supply decimated in a matter of a few short months. I truly believe in this project and I feel that if we just had a hard set low fee that everyone is able to pay and we burned that fee it would honestly help out more than the 1.2% or the .2% burns as it seems that with those methods people always seem to find a way around them and I honestly can understand why as a person who invested millions has to pay a huge fee on top of the millions of dollars they already used for investing.

https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/distribute-the-4m-in-off-chain-community-assets-towards-lunc-s-revitalization-v3/48321/1 

SUMMARY: We propose to divide the money from the multisig wallet [0x9538D438d506Fc426dB37fb83daC2a0752A02757] into manageable chunks to fund various initiatives. Our aim is to ensure that individuals and groups critical to LUNC’s betterment get access to funding sooner than later! 

STEPS: 
(1) Divide the assets available within the mult-sig into smaller portions; 
(2) Hire a legal representative (or firm) to oversee this extraction; 
(3) Ensure the money is clear of legal liabilities; 
(4) If necessary, nominate certain doxxed, trusted individual to act as temporary key-holders; 
(5) Once extracted, deliver the funds to specific beneficiaries as outlined in the proposal! 

FUNDING BREAKDOWN: 
30% - Purchase LUNC and send it to the community pool; 
30% - Direct fiat payout to Terra Rebels for their work; 
15% - Fiat or crypto to be set aside for programming bounties led by Zaradar;
10% - fiat reserve for hardware/endpoints if TFL withdraws LUNC support;
5% - Purchase LUNC and split it evenly between small validators to decentralize voting power;
4% - Fiat or crypto collateral for the Quant Team, to help with re-peg efforts;
3% - Fiat payout to Professor Edward Kim’s grants program;
2% - Funds set aside for legal council (hire a professional to review and process the $4-million wallet extraction);
1% - Direct fiat payout to Mr. Alexander Forshaw as a “finder’s fee” if he'll recuse himself from further proposal-writing!

Detailed Description of the off-chain utilization shared in the below agora post

https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/utilization-of-the-off-chain-community-assets-towards-lunc-s-revitalization/48545

Quick Summary:

a) Being decentralized chain, LUNC chain requires multiple personnel to contribute at the top as there are several ideas coming up from the community members. Involvement of more members with diversified ideas will help speed up the process of idea evaluation. Hence the idea of MultiSig's is brought back with modified process.

1. TGF to open application with selection criterial to identify new set of 6 (+3 signers); Conflict of interest clause to be shared by Terra Grants Foundation.
2. Applicants to share their personal accomplishments, plans for the next 6 months
3. Reclaim possession of offshore assets using new set of 6 signers
4. Sell offshore assets, buy & burn LUNC to get rid of legal implications
5. Mint equivalent amount of burned LUNC in Community pool
6. Expand the Multisig to 9 members to strengthen independent oversight and community participation: The new MultiSig would be a 7-of-9 (minimum of 7 ‘yes’ votes required to authorize anything, more than 2/3 of the signers should see value in the new idea / proposal).
7. Before working on a new project / roadmap, Signers to share their ideas with general public with an estimated expense / amount that they would require at the end of project completion.
8. Post concurrence from 7 out of 9 Multisig's on the effort estimates and based on community feedback, Signers will start working on the project
9. Signers should provide periodic updates in stages to the community members.
10. If there are any advance payment required, Signers after getting concurrence from TGF should initiate proposal for advance part payment.
11. At the end of project, signers to submit the efforts made, time spent, expense / cost to TGF and post TGF review, it is initiated for governance voting.
12. Once the proposal passes, Signers receive the payment for their proof of work towards building community projects or for adding values to chain.
13. Failure of Signer to execute duties or if the Signer is no longer willing to continue, new Signer is identified.

a) Compensation for Small Validators (who supported in early revival of LUNC chain before new validators gone live)
1. Small validators with voting power of less than 2% (at the time of execution) are eligible
2. Apply through TGF for compensation.
3. TGF evaluates the application and approves the compensation
4. 20% of the LUNC minted in Community pool as part of reclaiming the off-chain assets are equally distributed to small validators",0.21381598924482784
"Name Changing

This shouldn´t be an issue, but unfortunantely it is. The term ""Classic"" carries a prejorative meaning for either new investors and crypto veterans alike, that will undoubtly, see the ""Classic"" in LUNC as a put off. It might be an inconscious bias, but I truly belive its there, because it connects LUNC with its past, with other failed projects and dead end forks like Ethereum Classic. It is my understanding that the community wants to see LUNC move on from its past (the bad part at least) and focus on the future and not let it self be defined by it nor taken over by LUNA or other newer projects. There for I suggest renaming to ""TERRA GENESIS"", ticker ""LUNG"".

As part of this proposal the community votes to release 1% of the oracle pool to be released to assist in the appointment of the EC and to pay for the creation of the decentralized structure constitution, separation from TFL and the contracted employees. These funds will be held by a 3rd party payment company, for example bitwage to look after the funds and release them to the EC for works mentioned.

"Change The Name Of Luna Classic To Luna One

With the way the coin is evolving it would be wise to change the name and drop “Classic”, especially from a marketing point of view. Classic infers it’s an old and out of date coin, like other projects that have been given Classic status (Etherium Classic for example). It is a name forced onto the project when Luna 2.0 was created in an effort to try and take the interest from the original coin to the new.

Clearly the coin is no longer a meme coin and with all the changes being made to the blockchain. I think a rebranding reflecting the evolving project is a change that will have maximum impact on social media and will be picked up by all. Many of the changes made so far although much bigger in scale and undertaking are behind the scenes changes and are not always evident to a retail investor. It is a natural progression for the project to push away from its branding of Classic and show the world that it is constantly moving forward.

Whilst I realise that a name change is a relatively minor change, it will not solve all our problems, but it will be a big talking point and will cement home we have taken the destiny of the coin into our own hands as a community and removed the shackles of classic that was forced upon the project.

"Terra Classic Community DEX Step 1: Liquidity core module

Main motivations:
* Generate revenue at the protocol level and create value for the token holders
* Refill the Oracle/Community pools and burn the LUNC supply
* Develop a strategy to make the platform self sustainable
* Innovate to (re)establish Terra Classic as a top DEFi protocol

Leverage the existing DEFi infrastructure of the protocol to implement a DEX and generate revenues from transaction fees by capturing a share of the trading volume in pairs such as LUNC/USTC. This revenue will belong to the protocol and the amount used to refill the pools and/or burn the LUNC supply will be decided with Param Change Proposals via governance.

The oracle pool contains currently ~280B LUNC tokens ~1B USTC (around 65M$ in total). The idea behind this project is to borrow some of these coins internally to put them at work so the protocol can earn a yield under the form of transaction fees. These coins will remain the property of the protocol at all times. They never leave the protocol.

This is a UNISWAP v3 DEX (concentrated liquidity feature) implemented as a cosmos core module listing LUNC/USTC. Users can already swap LUNC/USTC in Terra Station but the swap is routed to an external dApp and is not part of the protocol. This will be implemented as a core module which means all the transaction fees from swapping will be sent to the oracle, the community pool and/or to burn the LUNC supply. The split between pools and burn will be determined by three parameters (% oracle pool, % community pool and % burn) which will be set via governance with Param Change Proposal. 

Deliverables:
* One cosmos module for the liquidity core module including a Swap function and Admin functions to add/remove liquidity from/to the Oracle pool
* Testing (Model Validation) using our open source python library leveraging terra.py
* Wiring the swap functionality in the front end (TS or RS or both)

Summary

ToxicLabsDAO is launching a Wallet called “Toxic Station”. The purpose of this prop is to receive funding for “Toxic Station”.

Motivation

Due to the increasing dissatisfaction and uncertainty of services with the current Rebel Station and Terra Station, ToxicLabsDAO wants to launch their Toxic Station for the community to be used as an alternative.

Proposal

Through painstaking procedures, ToxicLabsDAO finally finished their Toxic Station and is almost ready for deployment. In contrary to the 937,500,000 LUNC Proposal 11030 asked for, we’re willing to provide the same services for 5000 LUNC at a current approx. price of $1.

This proposal should be considered as a loan and the equivalent of $1 in LUNC will be refunded to the community pool in 1 week after the payout.

If this isent enought, we could change to 50% staking rewards + 40% to comunity pool + 10% burns. 
This way, we could have the 0.2% binance burns, we can suport developers and burn more.

"With a subscription system, we can burn at least 9.5 Billions of Lunc coins weekly apart from BINANCE burns.

As of now there are 5.23 millions of Lunc wallets on terra station of which 5.03 is active. Each week, there will be a donation challenge initiated at 12:00 utc on Friday and will end 12:00 utc next Friday.
   According to this challenge, at least 40% of the wallets should donate at least 1 USD worth of Lunc to a pre-burn wallet that will be set by developers (2.1 million with today’s wallet numbers). If at least 40% of the wallet holders donate at least 1 USD worth of Lunc to the pre-burn wallet (they are more than welcome donate more), the amount gathered in the pre burn wallet will be sent to the official burn wallet exactly at 12:00 utc the following Friday and with today’s price and wallet numbers we will burn at least burn 2.1 millions of dollars worth of Lunc weekly (it could be much more if wallet owners decide to donate more USD worth of Lunc).
   To protect the donaters who send those tokens to the pre-burn wallet earlier in the weeks, if at least 40% of the wallets do not donate at least 1 usd worth of lunch exactly until next Friday at 12:00 utc, all of the amount in the pre-burn wallet will be refunded to the wallets who donated them and there will not be a burn within that week. As burns happens, price will increase but so the wallet count too and we can create a balance between the total amount donated and total amount burned.
   This will give us a chance to burn 8 times more than what Binance burned this week which was around 1.4 billion. With today’s market conditions, 2.1 million dollars are worth 9.5 billion Lunc tokens and I believe weekly contribution will be much more than 40% of the walltes so burn rate potential is much higher than 9.5 billion per week. With the strong community and diligent developers that Lunc community has, I think we can make this burn happen every week. Moreover, we can show exchanges other than Binance that we are united as Lunc community and set them an example to follow.

"End Minting and Burn LUNC

As a community LUNC we need a strategy to develop our coin. I propose we put an end to minting LUNC until we have a clear objective. As a whole we must have a comprehensible knowledge on how to organize and expand our operations. It is essential that we have a developmental team, which aims to support our goals. Expand our community by generating solutions for our ideas, concerns or obstacles. Furthermore, have the potential to promote momentum in our progress. This will increase growth. I propose we add an optional section on the Terra Station to burn 1 million LUNC per user, who supports the idea.  On account of optimal participation we have the possibility to burn trillions. Therefore, raise the value of the coin/ decrease the debt. Additionally, I suggest we position a tracker on this section. So, the community may monitor the burn status.




When developers obtain money from the community pool, they need to quote us their fees for the work they fulfill and provide a delivery date for each project. Developers must be held accountable for projects they accept. ",0.17169554349774577
"LUNA Classic Blockchain Validator 10% Voting Cap

Purpose: Further increase decentralization of the LUNA Classic Blockchain by capping Validator max voting power.


Problem: LUNC Validator’s voting power is imbalanced. This has the potential to allow the passage of proposals not beneficial for the decentralization of the LUNC blockchain. In fact, it has the potential to enable the passage of proposals allowing the misappropriation of funds; and improper centralization of the blockchain.

The top 10 validators possess 70.74% of the voting power. 



Solution: Set the maximum voting power a LUNC Validator may reach to 10% of the total voting power. This helps improve the LUNC Nakamoto Coefficient (see below).


Process: Any validator that reaches the maximum 10% of the total voting power, all remaining voting power over 10% will be then equally redistributed to the remaining active validators that possess less than 10% of the total LUNC validator voting power. No current or future inactive validator will share the redistributed voting power. Any validator that becomes inactive post distribution will lose the redistributed voting power which will then be equally redistributed, as above, among all active top 130 validators.  


Historical Validator Discussions 

Prior discussions, LUNC Validators agreed to wait until new validators came online to consider capping the validator’s voting power. This date was October 26, 2022. It has now been two months and voting power amongst validators is still severely imbalanced as listed above. 


CURRENT NAKAMOTO COEFFICIENTS
A high coefficient means that a blockchain is harder to disrupt, because it's more decentralized.
•	Luna Classic has a Nakamoto Coefficient of 9.  
•	Luna Nakamto Coefficient of 57.
•	Bitcoin has had a Nakamoto Coefficient as high as 7,454 if not higher.
Source:  Terra Classic Aura Stake.   


APPENDIX
Nakamoto Coefficient: Indicator for Blockchain Decentralization
The Nakamoto coefficient measures decentralization and represents the minimum number of nodes required to disrupt the blockchain's network. A high Nakamoto coefficient means that a blockchain is more decentralized.

"Lower Validator Maximum Voting Power to 10%

We propose that validators’ maximum voting power (MVP) be capped at 10%.
One of the main reasons for aiming to put a hard cap on validator MVP is to promote decentralization and delegation dispersion. Giving any one validator too much power over governance represents an active threat to the entire chain. Most of the top validators have proven themselves to be benevolent so far, but it’s better to err on the side of caution when a $1B+ asset like LUNC is concerned, as we cannot predict what the active validator set will look like in the future, nor do we know who’ll occupy the top spots. Reducing the MVP from 20% to 10% would go a long way toward stopping any potential governance abuse and validator overreach.

Current supply of USTC (as the time of this writing) is 9,801,773,359 compared to LUNC which is 6,870,507,254,120 meaning 700x higher!!! Why are we focusing on the trillions when we can focus on a few billions? We all know that, if Re-Peg happens it will be very beneficial for LUNC

Lots of validators currently have 0 fees and their interest is to climb up to top position even if they loose money. If all those validators will increase their commission to minimum 5% and swap their LUNC rewards to USTC then burn every day, we can Re-Peg quite quickly. 

Our validator, MR GIVEAWAY will be the first validator to do this. We have created a discord server where we will create a channel for each validator that supports this initiative so they can post the USTC burn transaction each day for transparency. We have already started to burn USTC

During the first quarter of 2023 the Joint L1 Task Force completed several large-scale upgrades to the Luna Classic blockchain. These included v1.0.5 hotfix, v1.1.0, and v2.0.0. The v2.0.0 upgrade is a major blockchain upgrade containing upgrades to Cosmos SDK v0.45.13 and Tendermint v34.24
Given a successful first quarter, it is proposed that the L1 Task Force receives a Q2 mandate to continue development on the blockchain. In Q2 the L1 Task Force will focus on extensive testing for the v2.0.0 upgrade and building out the testnet, providing technical advice/development support for 'Ziggy' and deploy v2.1.0, brining the blockchain to parity with other cosmos blockchains. In addition, the L1 Task Force will seek to work with an L2 team* to develop ‘Classic Station’ and provide high-demand features such as on-ramp capability. The main benefit of maintaining an up-to-date forked version of Station includes streamlining the testing and upgrade scheduling process while reducing the burden on other 3rd party organizations.

"A Simple Framework for LUNC/USTC Network Revitalization

**Full disclosure: I recently acquired more LUNC.**

For those of us who fell in love with the LUNA classic network and its outstanding set of dApps with their seamless and easy-to-use UX, this past year has been an incredibly painful experience.

For reasons that all seem obvious in hindsight, UST failed to deliver on its central promise of stability for its holders. Some argued that the very premise of a partially-collateralized decentralized stable coin was a pipe dream and [the depegging event was simply evidence of that fact.](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/dark-moon-the-inevitable-collapse-of-luna/)

However, with the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank and its relationship with USDC, I think we all now realize the value of having a truly decentralized stable coin, and I believe USTC can still keep that promise.

**Let’s make USTC useful again.**

Why should LUNC holders care about USTC? Because without USTC, there is nothing to distinguish LUNC from any other meme coin. 

Or to put in terms that meme holders will understand: **without restoring the burn mechanism, LUNC will NEVER give you LAMBO.** :sob:

First of all, I want to acknowledge upfront that any revitalization plan requires trade offs. I think there was a lot of magical thinking around re-pegging UST to $1 which immediately followed the collapse that has hopefully subsided by now.

Here are the constraints that my plan attempts to satisfy:

1. NO NEW COINS (only pure LUNC/USTC)
2. Minimal development efforts
3. Restore USTC as a useful medium for transactions
4. Provide long-term value for current USTC holders
5. Burn LUNC :fire: :fire: :fire:
6. Incentivize/reward LUNC stakers
7. Restore the original mint/burn mechanism that resulted in the largest decentralized stable coin in history

**Okay so what's the plan?**

The plan has two parts:

1. Reactivate the mint/burn mechanism and set peg for USTC at 1/100 to the dollar or $0.01
2. Create a wallet funded by a LUNC/USTC transaction tax which entitles any Terra Classic wallet holding USTC at the time of the mint/burn reactivation to a perpetual dividend in proportion to their holdings.

**Why is this a good idea?**

There is a fundamental tension which exists between the interests of current USTC holders and current LUNC holders. This tension is destroying the chain’s ability to recover. LUNC holders must offer USTC holders some long-term incentive to realize a 99% haircut on their holdings.

This new USTC dividend wallet should grow more valuable as the chain grows and transaction volume increases. This gives USTC holders an incentive to support this proposal and be willing to take the haircut.

Part of the magical thinking I referenced above is the idea that USTC in its current form can regain the $1 peg. Unfortunately, this is not realistic as there is no way to reasonably cover its over $10 billion in outstanding liability.

Furthermore, LUNC holders will benefit because my plan ensures the USTC pegging to $0.01 will **burn** :fire: :fire: :fire: LUNC, *not mint.*

**How does that burn guarantee work?**

Once the plan is adopted, USTC is sure to immediately nosedive to close to the proposed new peg price of $0.01. There needs to be a mechanism in place to prevent USTC falling below $0.01 and starting a new unholy death spiral between LUNC and USTC.

Two important mechanisms should ensure this doesn’t happen. Firstly. Maintaining USTC’s peg at $0.01 reduces USTC’s outstanding liability to a much more manageable ~$110 million. Secondly, the fund for USTC holders at the time of the re-activation of the burn/mint mechanism should ensure that USTC still trades at a premium prior to reactivation.

**(Value of USTC at re-activation) = $0.01 + estimated value of future wallet fund dividends**

Once that value is locked in, USTC and LUNC can resume its once powerful relationship and bring utility back to the chain.

Hopefully this will set us on a much more sustainable path for future growth and reward both current LUNC and USTC holders in the process.

On a personal note, I lost a ton of money when UST depegged and still had faith in the networks ability to recover. This was magical thinking. 

A year later, I would be willing to realize that haircut if it meant the overall network health could recover, and I was offered some personal financial stake in the recovery of the network.

I would love nothing more than to see beloved dApps like Anchor, Kujira, Stader, etc. return to the chain, and all they have to do is update their USTC related pricing.",0.6386471951190983

While other types of DeFi are present on Terra DaaS/NaaS node projects like STRONG are few and far between if any exist at all on Terra.

See full proposal Summary here

https://agora.terra.money/t/new-ust-lunac-revival-plan-leadership-bid/14069?u=deathstar_daddy

I am proposing a solid plan to fix, and revive LUNA Classic and UST, as well as to further build and enhance the ecosystem.

I am further proposing a leadership change. I am inserting myself to lead LUNA Classic and UST. I am doing this as Do Kwon & TerraLabs will obviously be busy with the new LUNA coin ecosystem they are building from the fork.

However with that said, I am very hopeful to retain both Do Kwon and TerraLabs in some new form of a Partnership. They will not be leading our ecosystem containg LUNA Classic, or UST, but by maintaing a small ownership stake, and or other form of investment in NEWCO. As Do Kwon and his team are far more knowledgeable on our ecosystem they anyone, they would be a strong asset to Newco.

I myself, along with a New Team will lead Newco along with the ecosystem containing Classic and UST moving forward with the plan laid out on the link above. While market conditions may require us to deviate from it slightly, the core plan will not be changed. At least not wothout a vote.

## Bio

Being in Crypto since 2017. Rekt Lunatic, started vigorously supporting Kujira since May 2022 just because I once again found confirmation of my experience of what distinguishes bad projects and teams from good ones. Representative from the Russian-speaking community (https://t.me/kujira_ru). I act as a channel admin and a consultant for the community members. Also, whenever possible, I voluntarily help the Kujira team in finding bugs in the products. As a private investor, I am in the list of the top 100 KUJI stakers, invested most of my capital in KUJI. Project success == my success. My life principle is that if you take on something, do it well or don't take it at all.

## Related Experience

I had been working in IT for over 15 years. A computer science engineer by education, had the opportunity to try himself in different professions: Dev (C++), SRE (including as a team leader), DBA (including as a team leader), IT Infrastructure (middle manager), project manager. All this is in the different areas: healthcare, sports facilities, banking (the longest in time), and raw materials mining. In the distant past, I even tried to live off the income from trading (of course, it didn't work out). I really hope to apply my experience for the common good. Eventually, I fulfilled the dream of many spending nearly 80% of my time in Crypto right now.

## Personal Statement

Most of my time I am doing Kujira as an independent columnist, assistant, and consultant for the community, a modest generator of ideas and meanings. I am incredibly proud to be a part of the Kujira community because it has no equal anywhere in the Crypto world. I've seen a lot of teams around outside of Cosmos and there's not one even standing close to Kujira. I will continue to do what I am doing regardless of whether I am elected or not. The main value for me is the trust of the community, and I really hope to justify it.

## Bio

Long-term Terra & Kujira community member. Well known for trying to break down complex DeFi ideas for the retail masses, alongside a healthy dose of memes.

## Related Experience

Formerly Operations Lead at Prism Protocol. Member of GT Captial — spent many hours during the bull market reviewing pitch decks from projects for prospective investments & having detailed discussions around tokenomics and value accrual. Regular Q&A host with projects during their launch phase. In my professional life, I regularly work with vendors on contract & commercial negotiation & managing high-value commercial tendering processes — skill sets that I think would transition well to this role.

## Personal Statement

I've been a long-term supporter of Kujira, taking part in both seed and early-bird funding rounds, as well as consistently marketing the success of their various product launches. I believe in the success of Grown Up DeFi and want to help the chain succeed. I've also lived the dream of going full-time crypto only to have that taken away from me through the Terra crash and I'm keen to be back involved with a project in some capacity.

## Bio

Vanessa is an experienced Product Leader with more than 20 years founding and leading products at Google and Microsoft. For the last two years she has led products in Web3 digital identity and DeFi for a number of Web3 startups. She is also an advisor to three Web3 projects: Kavarii, a decentralized video streaming service built on MultiversX; Valorize DAO, a suite of tools for DAOs on the Ethereum network; and a stealth NFT project launching on Ethereum in early 2023.

## Related Experience

Vanessa has broad DeFi experience across a number of crypto ecosystems including Cosmos, Luna, Cardano, MultiversX, Polygon, Ethereum and of course Kujira. She brings a familiarity with algorithmic stablecoins, automated market makers, crypto onramps and offramps, decentralized lending and borrowing, and token launchpads. Much of her experience has been shared through her Youtube Channel, Just Crypto, as well as on Twitter. She is also proficient in the crucial crypto skill of meme making.  

## Personal Statement

Crypto is important because it allows for true ownership, transactions without a trusted intermediary, anonymity, transparent verification, equal access, freedom from government control and sound, predictable money. We're on the cusp of creating a new financial system that is more fair, more accessible. Yet we are beset on every side with centralized ponzi schemes, cash grabs disguised as businesses and DeFi reliant on inflationary tokenomics to survive. A decentralized economy needs decentralized money. It also needs to grow up. Kujira brings grown up DeFi and grown up governance to the Web3 economy. The Kujira team has shown resilience through the greatest of storms and is building at a rapid pace with a best in class user experience. Most importantly they displayed strength of character in offering KUJI holders one for one redemption on the new Kujira blockchain after Luna collapsed. I believe my skills, experience and passion can help Kujira bring grown up DeFi to the Cosmos and beyond. I would be honored if you would consider me for the position of Senator.

## Bio

Creator. Visionary. Dreamweaver… Kuji Kast.

## Related Experience

Before my Web3 journey, I graduated from UCL with a degree in Ancient History. They had a Senate back then. The first one ever. Which I studied. So in a way, my experience goes back as far as possible… Pre-crypto I worked as an actor, comedian, and filmmaker, and during this time I was involved in securing finance for a television pilot. I also worked for a conference company for 5+ years and would converse with companies to bring them to events at varying rates on various packages depending on their needs (group attendance, sponsorship etc). I would also assist startups in arranging meetings with Private Investors and Family Offices. I have also been a part of Kujira since pre-IDO. I have consistently been a believer and supporter and this led to the creation of Kuji Kast early this year. As part of making the show, I follow all the happenings of Kujira on a daily basis as well as speaking closely with each protocol that either has or is planning to launch.    

## Personal Statement

I believe very strongly in what Kujira is doing and have the strongest desire to see it grow. Having spoken directly with each protocol and forged strong relationships with them I have gained strong insight into who they are, what they require, and what they intend to achieve. I plan to continue to do this with each emerging project. I believe I will add a different element to the Senate; I see protocols and the people within them as essentially assets. For Kujira to be special we need to attract the best; I feel sometimes we as a community can be critical of newcomers (as we need to be) but also I see a need to balance this and ensure we create a welcoming environment where the best people want to be. A vote for me is a vote for love

## Bio

Crypto Degen, I try to educate the community and help projects grow. I've been working full-time in crypto since early 2021. I believe that crypto can change the world for the better and aim to help in that vision. Member of Kuji DAO.

## Related Experience

I've been in crypto since 2017, since then I've done everything from trading to NFTs, DeFi designing, and getting rugged. Currently I work as an analyst, most publicly with The Birb Nest as their Lead Fundamental Analyst. Also do research work with Apex Digital and other private advising for protocols and projects. I am the Treasury lead for Pozzle Planet, a protocol on Polygon, where we have not only applied for funding across different funds and VCs but also designed tokenomics and how the protocol captures revenue. Also am a DeFi Clan lead with Rekt Gang (NFT). I am also a Co-founder of Kuji DAO, however, I would not let this influence any of my decisions. Also, the DAO has 9 other members so I am only 1 vote there. In the past I've worked with startups, and also largely been an athlete so a bit of a diverse background.

## Personal Statement

I wish to push the growth and improvement of Kujira, this position is a way that I can contribute to the positive growth of the Kujira ecosystem. I believe many projects and protocols have struggled with their use of funds and often this comes back to bite them. I want to improve on the mistakes of the past and build something better for the future. This position means that I can look out for the ever-growing positive future of Kujira

- By voting **YES** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/HUAHUA pool (#605) on Osmosis.

- By voting **NO** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/HUAHUA pool (#605) on Osmosis.

**Details**

This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/HUAHUA pool (#605). This pool is currently the 36rd largest OSMO pool on Osmosis by Total Value Locked containing around 148,000 OSMO
 At the current 50% discount rate, this allows a further ~70,000 OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking, in addition to the OSMO from the currently enabled pools.

This proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of HUAHUA sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance as broadly discussed on this [Commonwealth thread](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/6343-enable-superfluid-staking-on-osmohuahua-605).

The Chihuahua ecosystem is a collection of tools and decentralized applications (dApps) that work together to support a wide range of use cases in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). Built on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, the Chihuahua ecosystem is designed to be fast, scalable, and secure, making it an ideal platform for building and using DeFi applications. The ecosystem includes a range of tools and dApps, as well as a governance mechanism that allows users to participate in decision-making and help shape the future of the network. Together, these elements make up the Chihuahua ecosystem, providing users with a seamless, decentralized experience.

After this proposal has passed governance, incentives for pool #481 will be removed according to the following schedule:

This Proposal: Directly removes Superfluid Staking from Pool 481 (~5.9% APR reduction)

Routine Incentives proposal on 23rd January, Effective epoch of 29th January: Incentives set to 50% of the existing allocation (~5.5% APR reduction at current liquidity)

Routine Incentives proposal on 30th January, Effective epoch of 5th February: Total removal of OSMO incentives (~5.5% APR reduction at current liquidity) and removal of EEUR from the list of Stable assets

**Justification**
Without lowering OSMO incentives on the EEUR pool, it remains an attractive place to provide liquidity, attracting new users to use EEUR as a stablecoin despite one aim of the unwind period being to reduce the number of holders to those who need to redeem directly with e-Money.

Tapering allows users time to see the announcement and unbond manually while using the maximum setting to prevent the incentives from increasing due to any additional volume the pool may see from holders exiting.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/WMATIC

On passing, this proposal would enable Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/WMATIC (#789) pool on Osmosis.

**Details**
Superfluid proposals ask whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance.

This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/WMATIC pool (#789).

If enabled at the current 50% discount rate, an additional ~120 thousand OSMO can be used to secure the network through staking.

This proposal comes after the bootstrapping period for WMATIC implemented in Proposal 386 has ended

**About WMATIC**
WMATIC is the wrapped version of MATIC that enables use on the Polygon network. WMATIC is similar in liquidity to WETH as the most liquid, volatile asset across Polygon. WMATIC is provided on Osmosis via the Axelar bridge.

"Phase out 1 and 7 day liquidity bonds

### Summary

By voting YES on this proposal, Osmosis stakers signal their support for the removal of incentives from existing 1 and 7 day liquidity bonds of and stopping the creation of new 1 and 7 day liquidity bonds.
 
### Details
1 and 7 day bonding have seen minimal usage by liquidity providers. Currently, around 1.6% of liquidity uses 1 day bonding and 2.1% uses 7 day bonding according to weighted statistics derived from Dexmos.app.
 
The usage of these distracts from the long-term focus of the Osmosis DEX and with the addition of Concentrated Liquidity strategies in pools, standard AMM liquidity is most suitable for more passive liquidity providers who are willing to bond for longer periods of time. 
 
Previously we at Notional have supported a ""time value of money"" and ""risk pricing"" concept, as can be seen here:
https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3921-time-value-of-money
https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4560-risk-pricing-of-delegations
Both of these past proposals can be seen as encouraging proportionality.

That said, both of the above proposals make users think and choose more. We believe in sane defaults: https://github.com/osolmaz/sane-defaults
In this case, the sane default is 14 days. Aligning 14 day bonding with 14 day staking has the additional benefit of promoting the use of superfluid staking. 

This proposal is designed to come on-chain before
https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/8894-automatic-staking-of-lp-rewards-to-validator-set-preferences so as to inform decision-making on it.

Target on chain date: January 18, 2022


## Implementation
* Users should be able to keep their 1 and 7 day lp positions without modification. 
* After the v15 or v16 upgrade, no new 1 and 7 day lp positions should be creatable.
* Incentives should be removed from 1 and 7 day bonds.

"Osmosis v14 Neon Upgrade

This is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v14.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 7937500, which is estimated to occur on **Monday January 23rd, UTC 16:00**. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates.

**NOTE: this upgrade requires golang version 1.19 to be used in building the binary.**

# Upgrade Features
This upgrade adds the following features:

## [Geometric TWAP](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/v14.0.0/x/twap)
Geometric Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) is now available as a price oracle for pools. Geometric TWAPs should theoretically be more accurate in measuring the actual price over time of a pool than the more commonly used, but also available, Arithmetic mean TWAP.

## [Downtime Detection Module](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/v14.0.0/x/downtime-detector)
This module detects if the Osmosis chain has been down for a period of time, allowing users of price oracles to wait until any price differential between on-chain liquidity and wider liquidity has been arbitraged away.

## [IBC <> Cosmwasm Composability Work](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/v14.0.0/x/ibc-hooks)
Added hooks that provide sender information when transferring tokens to a contract between chains. This for instance suffices for someone to build ICA via cosmwasm. Added the ability for IBC txs to register a callback that forwards into a smart contract upon packet lifecycle completion. (Timeout, or reached destination)

## IBC upgrade to v4.2.0
IBC v4.2.0 is required to make cross chain wasm hooks reusable, allowing usecases such as cross-chain swaps.

[Full Change Log](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v14.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)

# Getting Prepared for the Upgrade
To build the binary, be sure to install golang 1.19.
As always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors.
If using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v14/bin/.
If not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v14.0.0 binary.

## Details of Upgrade Time
The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be **7937500**, anticipated to be on **Monday January 23rd, UTC 16:00**. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown [here](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/7937500).
The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.
In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.",0.000961984257410157
"Recognise USDT as a Stablecoin asset

This proposal would recognise USDT as a Stablecoin asset on Osmosis.


**Details**

[Proposal 233](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/233) defined Stablecoins as an asset type to used in the incentive category structure.
Assets defined as Stablecoins are currently eligible for:
* Access to the Osmo/Stable Category for their incentivised pools
* Access to the Stable/Stable Category for their incentivised pools
* Automatic matching of External incentives within the Stable/Stable Category as per [Proposal 377](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/377)

In the [wider market](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins), USDT is currently the USD Stablecoin with the greatest share of Stablecoin marketcap at ~48% dominance.

"Incentivise Core StableSwap pool: USDC/USDT/BUSD

This proposal recognises the StableSwap 3pool of USDC/USDT/BUSD as a core StableSwap pool and enables OSMO incentives at the next routine incentives proposal.

## Details
This is a signalling proposal to include the StableSwap 3pool USDC/USDT/BUSD into the set of pools that receive OSMO liquidity incentives by recognising it as a core StableSwap pool.
 After this proposal has passed governance, the pool will be added to the regular incentives program of OSMO and receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool.

 The pool incentivised at this time would be [Pool 877](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/877) with all assets listed provided via the Axelar bridge and as such are the canonical representations of these on Osmosis according to [Proposal 206](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/206). If the canonical status of one of these assets is changed then incentives would move at the next routine proposal to the pool containing the new canonical assets, with the highest volume and matching the criteria stated in [Proposal 377](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/377).

 Stable pools are incentivised by the model defined in [Proposal 377](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/377). In brief, incentivised pools receive a subsidy of up to 2 times the value of fees generated in the pool in OSMO, with the total of the Stable/Stable category being capped as 4% of current Liquidity Provider emissions.

 This proposal depends on the passing of Proposals [402](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/402) and [403](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/403), which recognise USDT and BUSD as Stablecoin assets on Osmosis. If this proposal passes whilst one of the referenced proposals fail then it would have no immediate effect as one of the constituent assets would not be recognised as a Stablecoin asset. If all constituent assets become recognised by Osmosis governance as Stablecoin assets in future then this proposal would take effect.

"Upload SwapRouter Contract

Passing this proposal will upload the SwapRouter contract to the Osmosis chain.

## Details
The SwapRouter contract serves as a way to define, on-chain, routes that swaps from one asset to another will take. 

This is important as there may exist multiple pools that are available for each potential swap with differing:
* Fees (including Multihop discount routes)
* Curves (e.g. Balancer vs StableSwap)
* Liquidity depths (Two deeper pools vs one shallow pool)
* Liquidity types (AMM vs Concentrated Liquidity)

The contract has an owner that can update default routes which is initially set to governance. However, the contract can be freely instantiated and routes may then be set on each copy for third party usage.

This proposal will upload the SwapRouter contract to the Osmosis platform. This will allow the contract to be instantiated and begin performing its intended functions.

"Bootstrapping liquidity for Mars Protocol through Spend of Redirected Incentives

This proposal would transfer 310,000 OSMO from the community pool, to be used as pool rewards over 90 days in order to bootstrap Mars liquidity on Osmosis.

## Details
Mars protocol is a Money Market and Credit protocol initially launched on Terra that will be launching a Cosmos chain as the hub of its operations for the IBC network.  Mars' first outpost of operations will be on Osmosis as the home of the deepest liquidity across IBC and enable users to lend, borrow and earn against Mars governance gated credit lines.

Mars protocol wishes to quickly build liquidity on Osmosis to provide stability for the governance of their credit module and proposes that it is in Osmosis' interest to assist in funding this stability to ensure the security of and smooth operation of its outpost.

At the time of the Terra De-peg (May 7, 2022), the Mars fully diluted market cap was $797 Million, with a contained liquidity of [$263 Million](https://defillama.com/protocol/mars-protocol). The Mars token itself had [~$32 Million](https://forum.astroport.fi/t/arc-6-add-astro-emissions-for-the-mars-ust-pool/308/11) liquidity in the MARS/UST Astroport pair, the dominant Terra exchange. Under current market conditions, and the average trading value in the post-depeg climate, a MARS pool liquidity of around $3.4 million should still be achievable. [Calculations here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVVBusqYSVi3VSNvJBGs0QtpkOZamcaC2AB5i_1WzqU/edit?usp=sharing).

In order to achieve this rapidly and establish Osmosis as the primary marketplace for the Mars token, as well as ensure that the first outpost is established on solid ground, this proposal asks for a spending of previously redirected incentives to provide bootstrapping rewards for the MARS/OSMO pool.

A community pool spend of 310,000 OSMO will be allocated to 14-day bonding within the OSMO/MARS pool over 90 days. This should cause liquidity to quickly reach the post-depeg levels of liquidity based on the current Osmosis value, the average price of the Mars token after the UST depeg, before the pool APR becomes comparable to alternative pools of this size. This spend should be considered to be a deployment of incentives previously redirected from normal OSMO incentives to the community pool.

"Update Shentu IBC Client on Osmosis

This proposal will update the expired client on channel-146 between the Osmosis-1 and Shentu-2.2. Client 07-tendermint-1741 has been expired due to the recent Shentu chain upgrade.

- By voting **YES**, the Osmosis stakers, voice their support to unfreeze IBC channel-146 between Osmosis-1 and Shentu-2.2.

- By voting NO, the Osmosis stakers voice their dissent to unfreeze IBC channel-146 between Osmosis-1 and Shentu-2.2.

**Details:**

In the case that this proposal goes through, client 07-tendermint-1741 state will be substituted by the state of client 07-tendermint-2603, what will unfreeze channel-146 and will allow users to transfer tokens between Osmosis and Shentu again.",0.008986669214649856
"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STRD

- By voting **YES** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for enabling Superfluid Staking on the STRD/OSMO (#806) pool

- By voting **NO** on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for enabling Superfluid Staking on the STRD/OSMO (#806) pool
## Details**
STRD/OSMO is currently the 29th largest pool on Osmosis by, with ~277,000 OSMO. At the current 50% discount rate, superfluid staking would allow a further ~135,000 OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking.

## About Stride

Stride provides secure liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride has a huge emphasis on security, with a minimalist blockchain, rate limiting, and continual auditing. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations. Strides LSDs are expected to be integrated with these coming Osmosis applications: Mars, Levana, Membrane, and Margined.

"OSMO/WYND Token Swap for Protocol Liquidity

This proposal requests a spend of 52,000 OSMO from the Osmosis Community Pool to establish Protocol Liquidity of WYND/OSMO within both community pools.

## Details
This proposal is the mirror of the proposal on [WYND DAO](https://app.wynddao.com/vote/B82) to request 170,000 WYND. If only one proposal passes then the community spend shall be returned to the corresponding community pool.

If both proposals pass, 26,000 OSMO would be directly swapped for 85,000 WYND from WYND DAO. This is an approximate value of $25,000 of each token.

These funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig composed of:
* Claimens (CryptoCrew Validator)
* Jasbanza (Osmosis Support Lab)
* Luisqa (Zenith Station Validator)

Each will then add liquidity to the pools on their respective exchanges.

The pools with protocol-owned liquidity will be:
* [WYND/OSMO pool on Osmosis](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/902)
* [WYND/OSMO pool on WYND DEX](https://dex.wynddao.com/pools/juno1s00g9axpxgmwcrlc6xqcxzcjmaqpxhftkx62xfh64xends8ls5dqyyjnnl)

This liquidity will NOT be bonded on either DEX and so will not impact incentives to Liquidity Providers who are bonded.

Any excess tokens that are unable to be provided as liquidity due to a price ratio change between this proposal going on-chain and liquidity being added will be returned to the original owner.

For Osmosis, the GAMM tokens representing this liquidity shall be returned to the Osmosis Community Pool, these may not be sold or deconstructed for a minimum of 1 year, and a governance proposal will be required to remove or modify the LP position in any way.

For WYND, this liquidity shall not be sold or removed from the liquidity pool for a minimum of 1 year and is owned by the WYND DAO, and a governance proposal will be required to remove or modify the LP position in any way.

In total, if passed, liquidity will be provided evenly across the WYND/OSMO pair on both Osmosis and WYND DEX for a minimum of 1 year.

## About WYND
WYND DAO is an innovative, multi-protocol DAO that harvests the best of DeFi to fund positive real-world environmental impact. WYND DAO will deploy multichain DeFi protocols by using advanced CosmWasm contracts.
Twenty-five percent of the fees generated with these protocols will go to an Environmental DAO investing in projects spearheading actions to improve the environment. Delegating WYND tokens will give you a voice in the future of this unique Cosmos project. Osmosis Stakers were among those able to claim the airdrop before the WYND DAO launch and so there is significant crossover between WYND and Osmosis community members.

"ProtoRev Revenue Allocation

This proposal indicates that the revenue captured by the ProtoRev module will be allowed to accumulate within a module address until at least the 1st June 2023
This time will be used to gather data on the revenue accumulated and discuss ideas on how best to utilise it. After one month of reviewing proposals for recommended options, the community should make a decision on the direction of the ProtoRev account.

# Purpose

The purpose of this proposal is to provide a recommendation around how Osmosis should initially handle the revenue generated by the ProtoRev module.

Once the ProtoRev module is implemented as part of the v15 upgrade, the community will need to decide how this revenue should be allocated. We recommend that Osmosis wait a minimum of 4 months and let the revenue accrue to a dedicated account controlled by governance. While it should be deployed to the benefit of Osmosis in the future, the community should wait until it has accumulated enough capital to make a material impact whenever it is deployed.

# Background

## ProtoRev Module Design Overview

As described in the governance forum post about the ProtoRev module, the module will check a set of possible arbitrage routes after every transaction and determine whether a back-running arbitrage opportunity was created by the transaction. The module will then:
* Determine the most profitable arbitrage opportunity and optimal trade size
* Leverage the Bank module to flash-loan itself the tokens required to perform the arbitrage trade
* Conduct the swaps for guaranteed profit
* Repay the loan by burning the flash-loaned assets

These transactions will take place after standard user transactions at the end of the block to rebalance the pools and capture the arbitrage profits. The revenue captured by the ProtoRev module will accrue to an account controlled by Osmosis governance. The ProtoRev module will conduct OSMO and ATOM settled arbs initially, so this account will hold a mix of OSMO and ATOM.

## Benefits for Osmosis

The ProtoRev module is a groundbreaking innovation for AMMs and stands to improve the economic sustainability and UX for Osmosis:

**Economic Sustainability**
The ability to capture in-protocol MEV as protocol revenue is one of the largest competitive advantages that Osmosis has over DEX’s built on monolithic chains. These other AMM applications are limited to rent-seeking forms of revenue generation (e.g. Uniswap’s fee switch) because all MEV accrues directly to validators. That’s not to say that Osmosis should not implement a take rate on trading fees, but rather that it’s unlikely to be sustainable as the only form of protocol revenue.

We have already begun to see compression of DEX fees as evidenced by the introduction of Uniswap’s 5bps and 1bp fee tiers. We have also seen this dynamic play out with traditional exchanges, as Robinhood was able to capture huge amounts of market share from incumbents (e.g. Fidelity, Schwab) by removing trading fees. As more DEXs enter the Cosmos ecosystem, the ability to undercut fees will serve as a strong competitor differentiator for Osmosis. By allowing Osmosis to capture a more sustainable revenue stream in the form of benign MEV, the ProtoRev module greatly improves Osmosis’s positioning as the space becomes more competitive.

**Protocol Health**
In addition to capturing protocol revenue that would otherwise be lost to searchers, the ProtoRev module will also improve the UX of Osmosis. Current arbitrage systems run intermittently, allowing price differentials to remain in place for multiple blocks. The ProtoRev module will keep asset prices even across pools for every trade by running cyclical arbitrage at the end of each block to rebalance the pools.

# Revenue Projections

From October 1 to December 31st, there has been $176,637.97 extracted from Osmosis liquidity pools in the form of arbitrage transactions. This translates to approximately $1,941 per day. [(Source)](https://satellite.skip.money/)

As can be seen from the below charts from this period, this extraction varies hugely depending on the market conditions which trigger these transactions during periods of high volatility.
$30,737 (17.6%) of this MEV was extracted over the two days of October 27th, 2022 to October 28th 2022 (Binance Listing)

The FTX collapse caused significantly higher volatility and so higher MEV extraction during the second week of November 2022.

December 10th 2022 has a spike in price caused by manipulation on Binance due to closed withdrawals/deposits. [(Source)](https://t.ly/llXI)

[USD Captured as MEV on Osmosis 3rd October 2022 - 31st December 2022](https://t.ly/HWk1)

[Price and Volume chart of OSMO in the same period, showing alignment of volatile periods with increase in MEV.](https://t.ly/cvGZ)

During a stable bear market, excluding these spikes, we may expect MEV to reach $1,368 per day, of which an estimated 70-80% will be recovered by the ProtoRev module.

For comparison purposes, during the last bull market, for February 1st 2022 - April 31st 2021, cumulative MEV collected was $1,821,199, or $20,462 per day. This shows that the potential return from the ProtoRev module in arbitrage alone may be a significant part of protocol income in the future. Especially with the addition of links to many more chains since this period than existed on Osmosis at the time, allowing for more opportunities for arbitrage between routes to occur.

# Recommendation

As the bear market rages on, we want to ensure the MEV revenue generated by the ProtoRev module is utilized in a manner which maximizes its benefits to the Osmosis community. The Osmosis Community Pool at the time of this writing currently holds 63.22M OSMO tokens. This is expected to grow at an accelerated rate as we continue to shift incentives which were previously allocated to incentivizing liquidity pools.

To this end, MEV revenue should be deployed at times when the contributions can be meaningful in size to the protocol. As discussed, on average we may expect MEV to reach ~$1300 per day which we can expect the ProtoRev module to recover the majority of.

Although this creates a positive value accrual mechanism for the Osmosis community, the amounts being generated would not be significant if added to the community pool which currently is receiving 60% of the liquidity incentives. Allowing this revenue to be directed to the community pool would fail to maximize the benefits to the traders, liquidity providers and stakers of Osmosis.

In the current market conditions, directing this revenue to stakers would not move the needle in terms of value accrual to OSMO. By our estimates, stakers would only see a 0.8% increase in staking yield (e.g. 23.28% to 23.46%) if they were to receive 100% of the ProtoRev module’s revenue. Since Skip will receive 20% of the revenue in Year 1 (as part of the [community approved payment schedule](https://t.ly/EG3f), stakers would only see 0.14% added to their APR. While the community should consider this option in the future as the emission schedule winds down, or if MEV revenue increases, there are likely more impactful ways to deploy this capital in the near term.

As such, we are proposing the revenue generated from MEV is collected, until the funds can grow to have a meaningful impact towards benefiting the community. We believe it is in the best interest of the community to collect the revenue in an account controlled by governance. Over the next four months, community members should submit proposals with their recommendation on how best to deploy these funds. The community can then vote on the potential options to distribute this revenue. We recommend that the community should conduct reviews on a quarterly basis to evaluate the ongoing impact of deployed capital. Based on the results, adjustments can be made as needed to ensure this protocol income is utilized effectively and proportionately.

Below are some ideas on how we could deploy MEV revenue in the future:

**UX Benefits**
* Subsidization of swap fees, gas fees, or bridge / on-ramping fees

**Supplementing / Replacing Costs**
* Supplement LP yield for high priority (e.g. Superfluid Staking) or under-incentivised pools
* Supplement staking yield

**Other**
* Funding growth initiatives or loyalty programs
* Insurance pool
* Building a stablecoin reserve

# Conclusion
This proposal would allow the revenue captured by the ProtoRev module to accumulate within a module address. This will allow the community to assess the amount of typical value captured by the module as well as forming a reserve of capital. Accumulating a larger reserve will enable this capital to have a more meaningful impact when it is ultimately deployed.

This Revenue Reserve would be assessed no earlier than 1st June 2023. After reviewing proposals for recommended options, the community should make a decision on the direction of the ProtoRev account.

# Additional Note
While all options should be evaluated during the research phase, we believe that the community pool or DAOs with authorised spends are likely more appropriate sources of funding for any use case that would involve discrete, one-off spend. Unlike the community pool, the ProtoRev account address does not need consent from governance for each deployment of assets to every contract authorised by governance to be able to draw on funding. This enables more flexibility to create an approach that optimizes the streaming of funds to maximize impact. This post included a few potential options, but we welcome community members to put forth any ideas with supporting analysis and engage in discussion over the next 4 months.

"Update IBC Client for Cerberus - 2nd time

The Cerberus chain spent 1.5 weeks in halt due to the upcoming Dragonberry patch. Due to this halt, the IBC channel is currently in a frozen state. 
 The 8th November, a new client and channel was created in order to attempt revival of the IBC channel. After client creation, a proposal was created in Osmosis ( [proposal 357](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/357) ), but the counterpart proposal in Cerberus [failed to be submitted](https://www.mintscan.io/cerberus/txs/76829D74DCA31A865223D0279D56AAC2F75F2B7A7598B3DB4197F0F11A312AAC) (reason: software bug has been corrected in upgrade v3.1.0)(lesson learnt: try the little chain beforehand)

 # Upgraded cerberus proposal counterpart: 
 [Proposal 30 is up for voting](https://www.mintscan.io/cerberus/proposals/30) . This has been possible only due to the software upgrades.  

 # Stuck ibc funds: 
 If this proposal passes together with the counterpart proposal, it is expected that the client is updated and the stuck assets in IBC can be transfered again. 

 # Halt timing: 
 The dragonberry security issue was addressed by halting the chain and implementing further versions of the Cosmos SDK in Cerberus Testnet. Due to an expected further halt on the testnet, the halt timing was extended more than a week. 

 # Risk due to low liquidity: 
 The liquidity pool of Cerberus is very small. Backed by only 8000USD equivalent in Osmo at the time of submitting the proposal. 
 This pool can experience high volatility due to the users cashing out, validators exiting the chain (the chain lost 35 validators since October) or the founder abandoning the project. IBC communication has been interrupted for 4 months. 
 # Parallel events: 
 The closure of the chain is being discussed and will be voted via governance. The creation of a new chain from scratch for the remaining community is being discussed;",0.04536760662644449

"Signalling Proposal for Initial IBC Rate Limits

This proposal signals the implementation of initial rate-limiting criteria for net movements as specified below. These will be implemented in a future software upgrade.

## IBC Rate Limiting Background
The IBC Rate Limit module is a safety control implemented in v13, intended to protect assets on Osmosis in the event of security issues with:
* Osmosis
* A counter-party chain
* IBC

Rate limits allow only a specified net percentage change in the quantity of an asset on Osmosis within a specified time period.

This slows down the rate of any security incidents, allowing validators more time to respond, investigate and take any action required. Either capping the rate at which exploited tokens generated elsewhere can be sent to Osmosis for disposal or preventing unusually high amounts of tokens on Osmosis being removed.

## Proposed Values
As starting values this proposal will set the following for the largest assets, accounting for approximately 90% of all TVL on chain:

All Assets to be set to 30% in, 30% out within 24 hours and 60% in, 60% out within 7 days.

## Justification
Liquid staking assets are not included in this proposal as spikes in movement would occur in the event of a depeg event to stabilise the peg.

The 24 hour period was chosen in order to give validators across time zones a chance to act on any questionable behavious detected while resetting frequently enough that extreme market conditions are able to be reflected on Osmosis.

The 7 day backup period was chosen in case the 24 hour period was not sufficient for validator action to occur.

Limits set should be well outside peak usage and so not affect users using the exchange normally.

Token variance day by day since launch shows that the greatest variance by far happened during May 2022.
[Token Variance](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/16f14ce2-393a-41dd-95f3-17f7f8af26a1.1671358883648)

Confining this chart to the May and June 2022 period, which covers the UST depeg event as well as the v9 chain halt, shows that most variance was caused by newly listed and incentivised Axelar and Evmos tokens gathering liquidity.
[Terra Depeg and Chain Halt Token Variance](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bbcc5f16-68be-41ce-84b1-b16701c8bfe1.1671358893512)

Examining the Negative axis only - the impact of the USDT depeg and the funds temporarily lost during the v9 exploit can be seen. The proposed rate limits would have been triggered on alternative stablecoins during the Terra depeg event and prevented the v9 exploit from getting worse in the event that it had not been caught as quickly as it was.
[Terra Depeg and Chain Halt Token Variance, Negative Only](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/5fa80c86-b985-4837-b2ae-490ffcd70b1e.1671358903066)

Excluding freshly launched tokens from the picture also gives a view that net change reduces the longer a token has been listed. This may correlate to deeper liquidity but shows that these rate limits should be only implemented on high liquidity, established tokens, as well as being regularly reviewed.

"Remove Exit Fee option from pools


Passing this proposal indicates that the Exit Fee option should be removed from all new and existing pools in a future software upgrade.

## Details
Exit fees are an option that can be enabled at the point of pool creation. These cause Liquidity Providers to pay a fee when withdrawing from the pool. Users withdraw their tokens, minus a proportion of the LP shares, for the exit fee. These LP shares are burned, resulting in pro-rata distribution to remaining LPs.

As a method of retaining liquidity their usefulness is questionable. A liquidity provider who wishes to leave the pool will likely regard a small 0.1% fee as negligible compared to their reasoning for leaving, such as migration to another pool or confirming their current ratio of assets.

A larger fee may be better at retaining liquidity, however, these begin to prevent users from leaving the pool without sacrificing earned rewards and therefore increase the hurdle for users to overcome the sunk cost fallacy on declining pools.

Currently there is no display of the exit fee on the [Osmosis.zone](http://Osmosis.zone) frontend and so a user may not be aware of this fee when joining a pool, therefore being unable to estimate the time they must provide liquidity for before their returns outweigh the exit fee. If this proposal is rejected then this should be added to make users aware of potential exit fees on pools.

Very few pools have utilised exit fees during the lifetime of Osmosis, the majority of which are abandoned. All pools currently utilising Exit fees are listed below.

This proposal argues that the option to have exit fees is at best, obsolete, with other methods of liquidity stickiness such as the now default 14 day bonding time, and at worst harmful to the Osmosis liquidity provision experience. Accommodating this setting in frontend displays and integrations causes unnecessary complexity and so this setting should be removed during a future software upgrade.

During removal, all pools with Exit Fee settings will have it removed and no future pools will be able to add one.

"Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match

## Signaling Proposal for IST/OSMO External Incentive Match

### Summary
This is a signaling proposal to re-include the IST pool OSMO/IST (#837) into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. After this proposal has passed governance, pool #837 will once again be added to the regular incentives program of Osmosis. 

### Voting
* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/IST (#837) on Osmosis.
* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/IST (#837) on Osmosis.

### Description
Pool 837 - OSMO/IST is currently incentivized with 450,000 BLD over 90 days from January 9, 2023.
Inter Protocol’s IST token launched on 10/27 with the launch of Agoric’s JavaScript platform. After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST. IST liquidity will be incentivized through the Cosmos ecosystem, with Osmosis being a critical early destination.
The authors believe that it would be in the best interests of the community to incentivize an OSMO-IST pool to drive deep eventual liquidity and easy access from any other Osmosis token.

### What is IST?
IST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric’s unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric’s model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.

For its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST. Each PSM accepts another Cosmos stablecoin and mints IST in exchange. There are currently six PSM contracts running, accepting DAI, USDC and USDT over both Axelar and Gravity bridges, each with different minting limits. Rationale for the current minting limits was explained by the elected governance committee here: https://community.agoric.com/t/ist-minting-limits-for-inter-protocol-mvp-launch/87/1 

Additional PSMs may be added by governance to accept new IBC-accessible stablecoins. 
IST’s next iteration will include overcollateralized vaults, which will drive a major unlock for minting capability and allow the token to diversify away from bridge risk and stablecoin centralization risk.

"Signaling Proposal - Define New Stable Asset: IST and incentivize stable swap pool DAI / CMST / IST with OSMO rewards

## Signaling Proposal - Define New Stable Asset: IST and incentivize stable swap pool DAI / CMST / IST with OSMO rewards

## Part 1: Recognize IST as a Stable asset, a Stabletoken
This proposal would recognize IST as a Stabletoken asset on Osmosis.

### Details
Stablecoins backed by fiat assets are under regulatory scrutiny.  There are stable assets that are still pegged to fiat currencies, but are backed by on-chain cryptocurrencies instead of off-chain regulated fiat assets.
Throughout this proposal the distinction between the two are defined as:  

**Stablecoin** - (1) A cryptocurrency designed to maintain parity with another asset, usually an off-chain asset or fiat currency, such as US Dollar.  (2) Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value, unlike most other cryptocurrencies which are known for their volatility. This is achieved by pegging the value of the stablecoin to a stable asset, such as the US dollar. This makes stablecoins useful for transactions and payments, as they provide the benefits of cryptocurrencies (such as fast, secure, and borderless transactions) without the volatility that can make other cryptocurrencies difficult to use as a reliable store of value.

**Stabletoken** - A class of stablecoins that are backed with primarily on-chain cryptocurrency assets rather than off-chain assets.

The use of Stabletoken is encouraged to differentiate between stable currencies that are backed by off-chain regulated  assets vs on-chain assets.

Proposal 233 defined Stablecoins (and therefore the class Stabletokens)  as an asset type to be used in the incentive category structure. Assets defined as Stablecoins/Stabletokens are currently eligible for:

Access to the Osmo/Stable Category for their incentivized pools
Access to the Stable/Stable Category for their incentivized pools
Automatic matching of External incentives within the Stable/Stable Category as per Proposal 377 

Part 1 of this proposal established IST as a Stablecoin/Stabletoken asset on Osmosis.

### Voting
* By voting YES on this proposal, IST will be recognized on Osmosis as a Stabletoken.
* By voting NO on this proposal, IST's status will remain unchanged

**About IST**  
IST is currently the largest native Cosmos circulating Stabletoken with over $1.8M minted.
It is currently mintable via the Inter Protocol parity stability module from USDC, USDT or DAI and will be mintable later this year from volatile assets, such as ATOM.  Exchanges that list IST include Crescent and Osmosis with more coming online every monthly.  As a native Cosmos Stabletoken, it is not a bridged asset and once minted on the Agoric chain, can be used by any and all of the IBC zones.

Website: https://inter.trade/

## Part 2: Enable OSMO incentive for core StableSwap pool DAI / CMST / IST
Part 2 of this proposal recognzes the StableSwap 3 pool of DAI / CMST / IST as a core StableSwap pool and enables OSMO incentives at the next routine incentives proposal.
This is a signaling proposal to include the StableSwap 4 pool DAI / CMST / IST into the set of pools that receive OSMO liquidity incentives by recognising it as a core StableSwap pool.
After this proposal has passed governance, the pool will be added to the regular incentives program of OSMO and receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool. 
The pool incentivised at this time would be Pool 908 with IST & CMST being native Cosmos stable tokens and DAI & USDC provided via the Axelar bridge and as such are the canonical representations of these on Osmosis according to Proposal 206. 
If the canonical status of one of these assets is changed then incentives would move at the next routine proposal to the pool containing the new canonical assets, with the highest volume and matching the criteria stated in Proposal 377.
Stable pools are incentivised by the model defined in Proposal 377. In brief, incentivised pools receive a subsidy of up to 2 times the value of fees generated in the pool in OSMO, with the total of the Stable/Stable category being capped as 4% of current Liquidity Provider emissions.

### Voting
* By voting YES on this proposal, the Stable Swap 3 pool of DAI / CMST / IST will be added to the regular incentives program of OSMO and receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool. 
* By voting NO on this proposal, the pool will not be incentivized.


**About DAI**  
DAI is a Stablecoin cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain generated by MakerDAO. The current version of DAI in use on Osmosis arrives from Ethereum via the Axelar bridge.

**About CMST**  
Composite - $CMST, a fully collateralized, IBC-enabled stablecoin, is built to bring liquidity to Cosmosassets and power DeFi on Cosmos.

"Signalling Proposal for OSMO/FTM incentivised pool

This is a signalling proposal to include the Fantom pool OSMO/(w)FTM (#900) into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives.

After this proposal has passed governance, pool #900 will be added to the regular incentives program of Osmosis.

## About Fantom
Fantom is a high-performance, scalable, EVM-compatible, and secure smart-contract platform. Fantom’s mainnet deployment—Fantom Opera—is built on Fantom’s consensus mechanism, Lachesis. Fantom is a leaderless, asynchronous, and byzantine fault-tolerant Layer 1 blockchain protocol.

Lachesis enables Fantom to deliver fast transaction speeds, low transaction costs, and deterministic finality. This is achieved while remaining permissionless, decentralized, and open-source.

FTM is currently provided on Osmosis via the Axelar bridge.

"Add FTM to the list of Major category assets

This proposal would add FTM to the list of assets that Osmosis recognises as strategically important for growth, increasing the incentives allocated to it.

## Details
FTM is currently the rank 42 cryptocurrency by marketcap with a valuation of around $1.5 Billion, 3 times higher than Osmosis. wFTM is the wrapped version of this able to be used across Fantom DeFi, for the purposes of bridged assets to other chains these are treated the same on Osmosis.

The majority of trade volume happens on alternative decentralised exchanges for wFTM and centralised exchanges for FTM, not on Osmosis.

This proposal asks if Osmosis has a strategic interest in attracting more liquidity of FTM and so will enable it to access a greater proportion of liquidity incentives.

"FTM Bootstrapping liquidity incentives

This proposal would add OSMO incentives directly to the OSMO/(w)FTM pool (#900) consisting of 0.5% of liquidity incentives and maintain this for a period of 4 routine incentive proposals.

## Details
The normal signalling proposal to allocate incentives would go into effect at the next routine incentives proposal providing some incentives on the 26th February 2023. This proposal would provide initial incentives on the 21st February by actioning the following:
* Directly allocating 0.5% of incentives to the OSMO/(w)FTM pool (#900)
* Set Minimum incentives for the OSMO/(w)FTM (#900) pool of 0.5% for 4 routine proposals to retain this level of liquidity incentives while liquidity is built.

Bootstrapping incentives indicate that Osmosis stakers wish to quickly establish functional liquidity of FTM to facilitate trading and liquidity flow between Fantom and Osmosis via the Axelar bridge.

"Whitelist Apollo Vaults for USDC and ATOM

This proposal whitelists the Apollo Vault addresses for OSMO/ATOM and OSMO/USDC for ForceUnlocking, enabling them to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within.

## What are Vaults?
Vaults are a key piece of infrastructure required to enable leveraged yield farming on Osmosis.

Vaults allow users to deposit tokens to be managed by a protocol and enable access to yield strategies offered by that protocol.

The first such strategy is Apollo's [Leveraged Liquidity Provision](https://articles.apollo.farm/the-future-of-apollo/), launching in conjuction with [Mars Protocol](https://marsprotocol.io/).

Leveraged Liquidity Positions require depositing assets into a vault which then provides liquidity on a user's behalf. These assets may then be used as collateral via Mars' Rover Credit Accounts to increase the value of the liquidity provided. The vault also auto-compounds rewards into the pool to maximise yield.

In the event of the pool's value dropping below a declared safety threshold and the position being liquidated, the collateralised assets within the vault are required to be automatically sold. As these assets will be locked in order to receive liquidity incentives this is not possible without allowing the vault addresses to directly bypass this restriction and unlock assets immediately rather than waiting for the bonding period to pass.

Apollo LP Vaults have been audited by Oak Security and the audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/master/Apollo).

## Implementation
This proposal directly whitelists two addresses to be able to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within them.

These addresses are the deposit addresses for the following vaults:
* OSMO/ATOM (#1) (14 Day Bonding) - osmo1g3kmqpp8608szfp0pdag3r6z85npph7wmccat8lgl3mp407kv73qlj7qwp

"Babylon signalling and phase1 Integration 


Proposal Doc:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lx7MkpZh9pZy-XumReohvpGUf6gjSapFnRyG868b49o/edit?usp=sharing

0. Summary

Babylon proposes a 3-phase integration to allow Osmosis to leverage the security  of the Bitcoin network and enjoy benefits such as fast stake unbonding and extra security for high-valued transactions. This signaling proposal serves a dual purpose: it not only signals the Osmosis community's intent to integrate phase 1 shortly after Babylon mainnet, but also provides a clear roadmap for the integration process. Phases 2 and 3 will be specified and voted for by the community in future governance proposals.

CommonWealth forum post: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9967-babylon-integration-proposal-with-osmosis

We have created an FAQ based on the feedback we received from the community which can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1NmMZZTtWPJRWJXwPtAWIykAPDmPaZx4OgyL8fS2ik/edit?usp=sharing

1. Overview

The Babylon project allows PoS chains to leverage Bitcoin security. Babylon uses Bitcoin to timestamp critical PoS consensus data (such as headers with quorum certificate). This secure timestamping resolves a fundamental security threat to PoS chains that allows attackers to fork the chain without being slashed, known as the long-range attack.
But Babylon doesn’t just protect against long-range attacks. The same secure timestamping also improves the security dynamics for Cosmos PoS chains. To name a few: It allows for a shorter unbonding period without impacting the PoS chain’s security. It allows Osmosis clients to enjoy additional security for important high-valued transactions. It also allows for easier state sync and snapshot verification for node operators. It can also help with the IBC client initialization and verification, which is particularly important for Osmosis. 

2. Additional Context

Babylon has conducted several events around Bitcoin security for Cosmos with Osmosis and Juno among others. There has been strong Cosmos community support for these efforts with 150+ people signing up for these events. Sunny from Osmosis has spoken at these events with great community receptivity from both the Babylon and Osmosis communities.
3. Summary of the Three Phases of Integration
Babylon proposes a 3-phase integration to allow Osmosis to leverage the security and availability of the Bitcoin network. At its core, Babylon verifies Osmosis’ critical consensus data (called checkpoints) submitted by IBC relayers and aggregates the checkpoints for secure Bitcoin timestamps.
The table below summarizes the integration phases. In particular, Phase-1 integration is permissionless, since it only involves a standard IBC connection without any code changes to Osmosis. Yet it can already unlock Bitcoin security for Osmosis. All the integrations will be thoroughly reviewed and tested on Osmosis testnet first. Separate governance proposals will be submitted for mainnet integrations.

Three Phase Table
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF2xpu0reAbBHfNz4dult8DrPux-mnTZx3qP9SWQsug/edit?usp=sharing

The Babylon integration will not impact the infrastructure and operations of Osmosis validators and relayers. It will provide extra information and tools that help them secure the network. 


4. More Details about the Integrations 

Phase-1: The Oracle

IBC relayer’s client sync functionality will automatically submit Osmosis’ signed headers to Babylon. These headers will enter the Babylon ledger and be verified, and will receive secure BTC timestamps. Then any Babylon node can serve as an oracle for queries about:
the BTC-finalized Osmosis headers
whether there were long-range attacks to Osmosis
This information provides objective trusted heights and headers that allow Osmosis node operators (such as validators) and IBC relayer operators to bootstrap and verify Osmosis full nodes, light clients, and snapshots. It also allows Osmosis’ counterparty chains to verify their Osmosis IBC client.
Below is an example API call to a Babylon node for the query: 
>> https://<ip>:<port>/babylon/zoneconcierge/v1/finalized_chain_info/{chain_id} 
The Babylon team will also maintain an API server and web service for better visualization and usability. For example, Babylon’s web service can display real-time updates of the partner chain’s latest information.
The Babylon team will also provide additional standalone tools to verify the correctness of any Babylon nodes. 
Phase-2: On-Chain Automation
The Babylon team will work with the community to design and develop an IBC application module that handles BTC timestamps and associated proofs sent by Babylon. Osmosis will import this module to its App struct. The module will work standalone and thus will not require changes to other codes, nor impact existing functionalities.
Compared to Phase-1 where Osmosis users will need to access Babylon oracle nodes for Osmosis’ BTC timestamp information, this phase will enable the following on-chain automation:
automatically decide the latest headers finalized by BTC 
automatically detect and alert any forking attacks on partner chain observed by Babylon
This phase will also be an enabler of Phase-3 integration, which utilizes the on-chain BTC timestamp information.

Osmosis x Babylon Genesis swap

In order to foster a sense of cohesion and shared purpose between our communities, Babylon will be implementing a strategic initiative during Phase 2 of our project. As part of this initiative, we will be requesting token swap. These funds will be added to Babylon's community pool and will be utilized to support the growth and development of the Babylon partnership with Osmosis.

Key components of this initiative will be the delegation and staking of the acquired OSMO and bootstrapping liquidity pools. This will not only help to secure the network and support the underlying blockchain, but will also provide a way for Osmosis to actively participate in the growth and success of Babylon. By ensuring that the genesis swap is being used to support both ecosystems, we believe that we can effectively promote alignment and a sense of shared ownership among our communities.

Overall, this initiative is a crucial step towards building a strong and united partnership, and we are confident that it will play a key role in the long-term success of Babylon and integrations of bitcoin security on Osmosis. Details of the genesis swap will be included in a future prop (phase2).

BABYLON/OSMO liquidity bootstrapping pool on Osmosis
Babylon available on Osmosis
Aligned success for both communities 
Diversify both babylon and Osmosis community pool 

Phase-3: Unbonding Time Reduction 

The Babylon team and Osmosis team will work together to hook Osmosis’ staking module with the IBC application module imported in Phase-2. The stake unbonding/undelegating request approval conditions will be updated to include the associated Osmosis block’s BTC finalization information provided by the IBC application module.
The BTC finalization time will be a configurable parameter. It enables a configurable stake unbonding time that can be as short as 15-30 hours, which is much shorter than the current 14 days.
(The Babylon team is also researching other use cases of BTC security with the community.)
5. Pro's of this Proposal
Better security for Osmosis 
Osmosis will become BTC secured with BTC-assisted node / light client bootstrapping and verification enabled, which is particularly useful for Osmosis validator and relayer operators
Optionally, much shorter unbonding time (as short as 15-30 hours, and is configurable by Osmosis) may increase the number of Osmosis community members (especially OSMO stakers such as validators and delegators) because it gives them higher liquidity and can also significantly reduce the “idle” capital that does not earn yield due to the unbonding period.
Babylon community will engage with Osmosis, increasing usage, community engagement and TVL
More institutional players may engage with Osmosis due to increased security of the chain through the Babylon integration increasing TVL
The integration will increase censorship resistance of Cosmos zones including Osmosis
6. Cons of this Proposal
Having a steady stream of IBC transactions will somewhat increase the size of osmosis blocks. The additional size per Osmosis block will be in the order of the Osmosis header size.
There will be additional development and relaying commitment, but Babylon is partnered with Cosmos’ leading relayers.

"Osmosis Proposal Standards

This proposal intends to supersede [Proposal 199](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/199) by defining a set of standards for putting a proposal into voting period on Osmosis.

Proposals that have not met these criteria should be met with `NoWithVeto`.

# Standards
Governance proposals must be posted as a draft on Commonwealth for at least three days before being submitted to chain to allow feedback.

## CosmWasm Storecode Proposals
*`wasm-store`, `migrate-contract`* 

CosmWasm StoreCode Proposals must contain the following information at minimum:
* Git Commit ID or release
* Version of Compiler used
* A description of the code's purpose for a layman

StoreCode Proposals must be posted with full text and links to the code to be deployed for a minimum of 7 days before being submitted to chain to allow deeper review.

# Exemptions
## Expedited Proposals
*Proposals Utilising the `--expedited` flag implemented in V12* 

Any proposal utilising the Expedited status as defined in [Proposal 278](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/278) is exempt from this requirement.
Use of this mechanism for non-urgent situations should be met with `NoWithVeto`.
Urgent situations must be clearly communicated as such with a corresponding Commonwealth post.

## Software and IBC Updates
*Currently `software-upgrade`, `cancel-software-upgrade`, `ibc-upgrade`, `update-client` commands* 

Software and IBC updates are not required to be posted for review. 
The coordination of Software Upgrade proposals is typically carried out in more direct channels between Developers and Validators and may be subject to sudden changes in scheduling. 
IBC Maintenance proposals are required when an IBC channel has become stale due to lack of use. Osmosis governance recommends that these proposals are discussed in direct channels between relayers to ensure that the settings are correctly configured.

## Routine Incentive Adjustment Proposals
*`update-pool-incentives` proposals are routinely submitted via the incentives process wallet [osmo1ahtwxyl7v5qu347u07lwxxkz4dpxpl48yr4une](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/account/osmo1ahtwxyl7v5qu347u07lwxxkz4dpxpl48yr4une)* 

Routine incentive proposals are not required to be posted for review. 
All other incentive adjustment proposals will be treated as standard proposals and require a 3-day waiting period unless expedited.

## Resubmissions
Resubmissions of proposals previously seen on chain, such as authorisation for continued matching of External Incentives to a pool, confirmation of continuing incentivisation of a pool, or resubmitting a failed proposal after further discussion may reference the original Commonwealth thread with updated values. However, good practice would be to make a new post linked to the previous one.

# Recommendations and Clarifications 

Proposers should actively seek and redirect feedback to Commonwealth by publicising their draft proposal. 

Proposers should respond to commenters to address any concerns and adjust the proposal criteria in line with constructive feedback and Osmosis community sentiment. 

Changes to the proposal should have a comment posted detailing the changes as this notifies participants that a change has occurred. 

A proposal should ideally have reached a negotiated consensus that is likely to pass before progressing to chain. 

Contentious proposals may still be loaded as long as the Commonwealth thread is available for a voter to reference for any counterarguments.

## CosmWasm Storecode Proposals
*`wasm-store`,`migrate-contract`* 

Code walkthrough sessions are recommended to ensure the deployment is secure through exposure to many eyes.

## Community Spend Proposals
*`community-pool-spend`* 

Community Spend Proposals are recommended to be posted for review for at least 7 days.

## Parameter Changes
*'param-change'* 

Parameter change proposals should include a link to a successful proposal on the Osmosis Testnet. This is to ensure that unexpected consequences do not occur from these rarely changed criteria, such as those from [Proposal 337](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/337) that triggered a 5 hour chain halt.

"Phase out incentives for BUSD

This proposal would wind down all OSMO incentives involving the BUSD stablecoin over the following two weeks.

## Details
On the 13th February 2023, Paxos, the issuer of the BUSD stablecoin, released a [statement](https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/) that they will cease further issuance on the 21st February 2023.

This impacts Osmosis as we have recently voted to [recognise BUSD as a stable asset](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/403), [onboard a Core Stableswap pool](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/404) containing BUSD, [incentivise the BUSD/OSMO pool](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/425) and [bootstrap it by allocating initial liquidity incentives](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/426).

While the cessation of issuance is concerning, Paxos have attestations of full backing and intend to support redemption of BUSD until February 2024. Therefore this proposal is not an emergency proposal and will stagger the removal of incentives from BUSD related pools to give users time to unbond.

## Proposed Plan
This signalling proposal lays out the path to removing BUSD incentives and has no direct effect.

At the first routine incentives proposal after passing the following would occur:
* Minimum Incentive allocation to Pool 879 removed (Proposal 426 Reversion), lowering incentives to a standard level for a stable pool.

At the second routine incentives proposal after passing the following would occur:
* Removal of Osmosis Incentives from OSMO/BUSD pool (Proposal 425 Reversion)
* Removal of Osmosis Incentives from USDC/USDT/BUSD pool (Proposal 404 Reversion)
* Removal of BUSD as a Stable asset (Proposal 403 Reversion)

"Upgrade stOSMO, stJUNO, and stSTARS Pools to Stableswap

This proposal is to upgrade the following constant product pools to the new stableswap pool type: stOSMO/OSMO (#833), JUNO/stJUNO (#817), STARS/stSTARS (#810).

The stableswap pool type is more suitable for these liquid staked derivative pools, as the two tokens in each pool are pegged.

The address “osmo1k8c2m5cn322akk5wy8lpt87dd2f4yh9afcd7af,” a multisig controlled by the Stride Foundation, will be used as the scaling factor governor for all three pools. That means that this address will be able to adjust the stToken : token ratio (i.e. peg) where liquidity is concentrated, which is necessary because the peg shifts as the stToken gains value against the token.

The swap fee for all three pools, which is currently 0.3%, will be reduced to 0.05%.

This is a signaling proposal. If approved by Osmosis governance, the pool upgrades will be bundled with the next Osmosis chain upgrade.

This proposal would recognise CMST as a stablecoin asset on Osmosis.
 Details 
 Proposal #233 defined Stablecoins as an asset type to be used in the incentive category structure. Assets defined as Stablecoins are currently eligible for:
 Access to the Osmo/Stable Category for their incentivised pools 
 Access to the Stable/Stable Category for their incentivised pools 
 Automatic matching of External incentives within the Stable/Stable Category as per Proposal #377 
 In the Cosmos ecosystem, CMST is currently the only overcollateralized stablecoin backed by decentralised assets like OSMO, ATOM, and stATOM as well as stablecoins like axlUSDC and axlDAI. CMST is currently part of the DAI/CMST/IST Pool (#908), which is the most liquid stablepool on Osmosis. CMST currently has a circulating supply of ~.3M. 
 **About CMST**:CMST aims to be the liquidity unifying stabletoken in the broader interchain ecosystem. Harbor protocol is a stablecoin protocol on the Comdex chain for minting CMST, which is an overcollateralized stablecoin, soft-pegged to the US Dollar. CMST, (at the time of writing this proposal) is the only open-source decentralised stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem that can be minted using OSMO, ATOM and stATOM as collateral. Being fully governed by HARBOR holders, and backed by a large range of decentralised assets like ATOM and OSMO, CMST is positioned to be the prime stabletoken for the interchain DeFi ecosystem.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/AVAX

On passing, this proposal would enable Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/(w)AVAX (#899) pool on Osmosis. 

## Details**
Superfluid proposals ask whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance. 

This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/(w)AVAX pool (#899). 

If enabled at the current 50% discount rate, an additional ~70 thousand OSMO can be used to secure the network through staking.

This proposal comes after the bootstrapping period for AVAX implemented in [Proposal 410](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/410) has ended.

## About AVAX
AVAX is the native token of the Avalanche platform and is used to secure the network through staking, pay for fees, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple subnetworks created on the Avalanche platform. wAVAX is the wrapped version of AVAX that enables use on the Avalanche network.

"Composability Incentives Category

This proposal would add Osmosis Liquidity Incentives to pools essential for bridging composability on Osmosis. 

## Category Details
The composability category is intended to provide small, fixed incentives to stableswap pools between identical assets with differing sources in order to facilitate trading on Osmosis through the deeper canonical asset pools, regardless of the origin of these assets. 

As a category that operates in the background, pools added to this category will not be expected to be added to the main [Osmosis.zone](http://Osmosis.zone) frontend. 

## Initial Pools
Initial pools included in this category would be: 
* [USDC.axl/USDC.grv](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/872)
* [USDT.axl/USDC.grv](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/873)
* [USDC.axl/polygon.USDC.axl/avalanche.USDC.axl](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/938)

## Establishing Targets
Based on typical trading volumes in the current USDC.grv/OSMO and USDT.grv/OSMO pools [require approximately](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/osmosis/incentives-optimization) $95k and $130k of liquidity respectively to facilitate trading to and from Gravity Bridge. As the intended composability pools are StableSwaps they are far more efficient than Balancer pools at providing the same function and so require approximately 3x less liquidity to facilitate trades at the same slippage. 

Conversely, with the lower levels of swap fees in these pools a much lower slippage should also be targeted. Converting the 0.2% swap fees to 0.04% results in a proportional target of 0.2% slippage. 

We can therefore target specific liquidity for slippage levels. This is calculated in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UcfBmnf8ZKOWBaqOim5yx2kTDWmE5Vy00NwqnbShPzU/edit#gid=0) and results in $45k of liquidity in a pair being required to cater for OSMO/USDC.grv trades and $62k to cater for OSMO/USDT.grv trades if they were StableSwap pools. This may be excessive as the APR from external Gravity incentives provided in [Proposal 347](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/347) makes these pools attractive and there will be activity from people wanting to join for the rewards rather than using them as a way to utilise Gravity Bridge. A baseline of $45k liquidity from incentives alone will therefore be established. 

Now the target Liquidity is established we need to identify an attractive APR for this liquidity level. Comparing alternative stable/stable pools across the Interchain shows that typical yields range from 12% to 28% APR. As additional fees will be generated from swap fees, 12% will be set as a reasonable baseline reward rate. 

## Rent vs Buy
As the total OSMO spend on incentives is relatively small at the intended liquidity targets, acquiring this liquidity through incentives in the more cost-effective option for approximately 5.5 years before purchasing the liquidity outright became a preferable option. As cross-chain bridging routes are still being established and may be subject to change with the release of native USDC on the Interchain, renting through incentivisation is also the more flexible option. 

## Requested Incentives
Bringing these together, to establish $45k liquidity earning 12% APR OSMO rewards requires a target of ~15 OSMO a day, which is a minimum incentive setting of 0.0062% per pool, resulting in around 0.02% of actual emissions going to each pool. 

The USDC 3pool requires 1.5 the liquidity and spend of a pair and so needs an emission setting of 0.0093%, resulting in around 0.03% of actual emissions going to this pool. 

This proposal asks that this be set as a fixed level of incentives for every pool added to the composability category to provide functional liquidity for bridge composability. These incentive levels would be set after this proposal and remain in place unless revised by a future governance proposal.

## About Polkadot
This version of DOT is provided via Axelar and Moonbeam was voted to be the current canonical bridge in Osmosis Proposal 249. 

DOT is the Moonbeam-wrapped version of Polkadot and requires unwrapping on the Moonbeam network from xcDOT after passing through the Axelar bridge to become native DOT.

"Re-evaluation of NGM/OSMO Incentives

This proposal asks if Osmosis should cease providing incentives to the NGM/OSMO pool (#463). Passing this proposal will remove OSMO incentives at the next routine incentive proposal. 

## Details
Osmosis Governance recently removed incentives from EEUR in the light of the winddown of the stablecoin by the E-money team: [https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/397](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/397) 

NGM/OSMO retained incentives from Osmosis as the [original statement from E-money](https://medium.com/e-money-com/eeur-stablecoin-unwind-cf945820fb3f) indicated that the chain would be pursuing other use cases. 

Over the last few weeks, multiple NGM pairings have been created with heavy incentivisation of NGM. 

This is part of a new strategy by the e-Money team to achieve the following goals: 
* Create multiple pools against major tokens to reduce exposure to a single asset (OSMO). 
* Join the pools using Treasury tokens programmatically and in a controlled fashion to not adversely impact prices. 
* Deploy genesis LP allocation of NGM to incentivise participation by 3rd parties. 

This is further detailed in this article: [https://medium.com/e-money-com/unwinding-eeur-issuance-and-boosting-ngm-liquidity-d66489b2a62](https://medium.com/e-money-com/unwinding-eeur-issuance-and-boosting-ngm-liquidity-d66489b2a62) 

The pool has had suitable liquidity for normal trading purposes up to this point and will likely grow further with the addition of these high incentives. The share of OSMO incentives this pool receives will also likely grow as there will be a sustained increase in trading volume from liquidity providers purchasing NGM from the NGM/OSMO pool to join the new pools as well as from the programmatic joining of the pool with single sided NGM to establish the team’s own liquidity. 

As Osmosis governance originally incentivised NGM/OSMO as a governance token of a chain with EEUR as its flagship product the Osmosis incentives should also be re-evaluated in line with this new strategy. 

This proposer believes it is in the best interest of Osmosis to remove incentives from the NGM pool for the moment until these pools settle and a course is confirmed for NGM.

"Whitelist Apollo Vaults for stATOM/ATOM

This proposal whitelists the Apollo Vault address for stATOM/ATOM for ForceUnlocking, enabling liquidation events to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within. 

## What are Vaults?
Vaults are a key piece of infrastructure required to enable leveraged yield farming on Osmosis. 

Vaults allow users to deposit tokens to be managed by a protocol and enable access to yield strategies offered by that protocol. 

Leveraged Liquidity Positions require depositing assets into a vault which then provides liquidity on a user's behalf. These assets may then be used as collateral via Mars' Rover Credit Accounts to increase the value of the liquidity provided. The vault also auto-compounds rewards into the pool to maximise yield. 

In the event of the pool's value dropping below a declared safety threshold and the position being liquidated, the collateralised assets within the vault are required to be automatically sold. As these assets will be locked in order to receive liquidity incentives this is not possible without allowing the vault addresses to directly bypass this restriction and unlock assets immediately rather than waiting for the bonding period to pass. 

Apollo LP Vaults have been audited by Oak Security and the audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/master/Apollo). 

## Implementation
This proposal directly whitelists the address to be able to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within them, enabling the liquidation of over-leveraged deposits.

"Upload Cross-Chain Swap Contract

Passing this proposal will upload the Crosschain Swaps contract to the Osmosis chain. 

## Details 
The Crosschain Swaps contract enables trades on Osmosis to be carried out remotely from another chain connected to Osmosis by IBC. 

The contract receives a token transfer from chain A, interacts with the Swap Router contract to exchange the received token for a different token and then forwards it to a destination address specified in the original transaction. 

On receipt of tokens from Chain A, the contract parses a memo field, enabled by IBC v3.4.0 in [Osmosis v13](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/370). This contains information set by the sender identifying the instance of the Crosschain Swaps contract to interact with and the intention. 

This Crosschain Swaps instance is linked to an instance of the SwapRouter contract uploaded in [Proposal 411](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/411) and carries out the exchange using liquidity on Osmosis. 

The resultant tokens are then forwarded to the address originally specified in the memo, be that a return to the address on Chain A or forwarding to an address on Chain C.

"Establish new Core StableSwap pool (USDC/USDT)

This proposal recognises the StableSwap pool of USDC/USDT as a core StableSwap pool and enables OSMO incentives at the next routine incentives proposal as well as providing initial OSMO incentives to establish functional liquidity. 

## Details
This is a proposal to include the StableSwap pool USDC/USDT (#939) into the set of pools that receive OSMO liquidity incentives by recognising it as a core StableSwap pool. 

This proposal aims to establish a target liquidity of at least .15m by allocating 0.182% of Liquidity incentives directly and maintaining this for 4 routine incentive proposals. 

After this period has expired, the pool will continue to receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool according to the regular incentives program. 

The pool incentivised at this time would be Pool #939 with all assets listed provided via the Axelar bridge and as such are the canonical representations of these on Osmosis according to Proposal 206. If the canonical status of one of these assets is changed then incentives would move at the next routine proposal to the pool containing the new canonical assets, with the highest volume and matching the criteria stated in Proposal 377. 

Stable pools are incentivised by the model defined in Proposal 377. In brief, incentivised pools receive a subsidy of up to 2 times the value of fees generated in the pool in OSMO, with the total of the Stable/Stable category being capped as 4% of current Liquidity Provider emissions.

"Osmosis v15 Sodium Upgrade

This is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v15.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height 8732500, which is estimated to occur on Thursday 16th March 16:00 UTC. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. 

# Upgrade Features
This upgrade adds the following features: 

## [Protorev module](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/protorev/protorev.md)
The ProtoRev module developed by [Skip](https://skip.money/), performs arbitrage transactions at the start of each block by identifying cyclic arbitrage, minting funds to perform it, burning the same amount of funds and returning the resultant profit into a module account controlled by Osmosis governance. 

## [Validator Set preferences module](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/valset-pref)
The Validator Set preference module gives users and contracts a better UX for staking to a set of validators by allowing delegation to multiple validators in a custom ratio in a single transaction. 

## [Pool-manager module](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/poolmanager)
The PoolManager module exists as a swap entry point for any pool model that exists on the chain by ensuring that all types of pools share the same underlying swap logic. 

## IBC Improvements
**[Packet Forward Middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware)**
Adds the ability to route incoming IBC packets from a source chain to a destination chain.

**[Asynchronous Interchain Queries](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/async-icq)**
[Interchain Queries](https://medium.com/@quasar.fi/introducing-interchain-queries-d6243e7b45cf) enable blockchains to query the state of an account on another chain without the need for ICA auth. 

## Implemented Proposals
**[Minimum Gas Price](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/4244)**
Authorised during [Proposal 354](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/354), this adds a minimum gas price for all transactions across the Osmosis chain which is then distributed to delegators and validators. 

**[IBC Rate Limits](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/4340)**
Authorised during [Proposal 427](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/427), initial IBC rate limits for large pools have been added, protecting assets on Osmosis in the event of security issues with Osmosis, a third party chain or IBC. 

**[Stableswap pool conversion](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/4384)**
Authorised during [Proposal 441](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/441), pools 810 (stSTARS/STARS), 817 (stJUNO/JUNO) and 833 (stOSMO/OSMO) have been converted to Stableswap pools. 

## [Full Change Log](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v15.x/CHANGELOG.md)

# Getting Prepared for the Upgrade
To build the binary, be sure to install golang 1.19. 

As always, we recommend validators utilize 64GB of RAM. Since state migration is relatively negligible in this upgrade, it is likely possible to get away with less, but still not recommended. If you are unable to have 64GB of RAM, at a minimum have a total of 64GB of swap set to prevent out of memory errors. 

If using cosmovisor, manually build & copy the osmosisd binary to /cosmovisor/upgrades/v15/bin/. 

If not using cosmovisor, wait for your node to halt at the upgrade height, then install and run the v15.0.0 binary. 

# Details of Upgrade Time
The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be 8732500, anticipated to be on Thursday 16th March 16:00 UTC. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time. See countdown [here](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/8732500). 

The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network. 

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord to come to a quick emergency consensus and mitigate any further issues.",0.00791995174445026

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/FTM

On passing, this proposal would enable Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/FTM (#900) pool on Osmosis. 

## Details
Superfluid proposals ask whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance. 

This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/FTM pool (#900). 

If enabled at the current 50% discount rate, an additional ~70 thousand OSMO can be used to secure the network through staking.

This proposal comes after the bootstrapping period for FTM implemented in [Proposal 435](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/435) has ended.

## About Fantom
Fantom is a high-performance, scalable, EVM-compatible, and secure smart-contract platform. Fantom’s mainnet deployment—Fantom Opera—is built on Fantom’s consensus mechanism, Lachesis. Fantom is a leaderless, asynchronous, and byzantine fault-tolerant Layer 1 blockchain protocol. 

Lachesis enables Fantom to deliver fast transaction speeds, low transaction costs, and deterministic finality. This is achieved while remaining permissionless, decentralized, and open-source. 

FTM is currently provided on Osmosis via the Axelar bridge.

"Allow USDC as transaction fees

This proposal would add USDC via Axelar as a valid fee token for use in paying transaction fees on Osmosis. 

## Background
Transaction fees on Osmosis have been payable in assets other than OSMO since [v5](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/95). This is managed by the [txfee](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees) module which specifies a denom to be accepted and an OSMO pool to use as a spot price for the quantity of that denom to accept. Any transaction fees paid in these denoms are collected in the module address and converted into OSMO for distribution to stakers at epoch. 

This whitelist was initially set as all OSMO paired tokens with usable liquidity on 1st December 2021. Since this point there have been many new tokens listed on Osmosis that fees could be paid in, enabling new users to fund the transaction fee for their first trade on the chain. This becomes more important with the minimum fee requirement from [Proposal 354](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/354) implemented in v15. 

This proposal directly adds USDC.axl as a valid fee token to pay transaction fees in. This is prompted by reports of users bridging from Ethereum and being unable to carry out their first transaction, as well as [data provided by Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Playwo/osmosis-fee-currency-overview-possible-additions-b0CBfx) which shows USDC as the most held assets in wallet with no OSMO. 

Other assets will be proposed as required or in bulk when the capability to add multiple denoms at the same time exists. 

## Test
This proposal has been tested on Testnet here: [https://testnet.mintscan.io/osmosis-testnet/proposals/57089](https://testnet.mintscan.io/osmosis-testnet/proposals/57089), adding testnet USDC as a valid fee source and carrying out a transaction here: [https://testnet.mintscan.io/osmosis-testnet/txs/F7311AC7AF48D4CD6E8640532FAF02207274E5F1A84196F9CB1357C537037104](https://testnet.mintscan.io/osmosis-testnet/txs/F7311AC7AF48D4CD6E8640532FAF02207274E5F1A84196F9CB1357C537037104)

"Allow Kado Router Contracts to be Uploaded

This proposal gives the address osmo19vxp8vq8qm368dr026qxh8v82satwaf79y235lfv6wmgpwxx8dtskedaku the ability to upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis without seeking further governance approval for each upload. This address is a 3/5 multisig consisted of Kado builders. 

Kado's Router contract will be audited by Resonance Security and/or SCV Security in the coming days/weeks. Kado hopes to upload ahead of the audit in order to do more thorough testing for their on/off-ramp, to ensure production-ready contracts ahead of the general availability to the public. 

Ultimately, the goal of this is to enable fiat -> X Token on Osmosis, enabling Kado to use Osmosis as a liquidity layer for on/off-ramp features. During this testing period, uploaded contracts will have whitelists in order to only allow Kado devs to interact with them. Once testing and audit are complete, these whitelists will be removed and the Kado contracts will be available for the public to use. 

Governance approval for contract upload was originally intended to keep the set of dApps running on Osmosis consistent with its objective of being a DeFi hub for the Interchain. While this proposal gives authority for this multisig to permissionlessly upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis, governance only signals approval for contracts relating to the function of Kado's Router contract. 

## About Kado

### About Autonomy Registry:
This proposal deploys the necessary code on-chain to deploy Autonomy Network as a base system to automate any on-chain action with any on-chain condition. Things are generally automated by using the Autonomy Registry in conjunction with a wrapper contract around some system - for example like a wrapper around the Osmosis DEX that allows for limits and stops on Osmosis. A 2nd simultaneous proposal will deploy the wrapper contract to add limits and stops to Osmosis. This was previously proposed in [proposal 342](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/342) and [proposal 343](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/343) but both were rejected because the code in proposal 343 was the wrong code being uploaded by accident. Since then, the code has gone through some improvements and an [audit](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/master/Autonomy/2023-03-06%20Audit%20Report%20-%20Autonomy%20Osmosis%20v1.1.pdf), and has been working well on testnet (osmosis.autoswap.trade).

"Whitelist Apollo Vaults for OSMO/WBTC and OSMO/ETH

This proposal whitelists the Apollo Vault addresses for OSMO/WBTC and OSMO/WETH for ForceUnlocking, enabling liquidation events to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within. 

## What are Vaults?
Vaults are a key piece of infrastructure required to enable leveraged yield farming on Osmosis. 

Vaults allow users to deposit tokens to be managed by a protocol and enable access to yield strategies offered by that protocol. 

Leveraged Liquidity Positions require depositing assets into a vault which then provides liquidity on a user's behalf. These assets may then be used as collateral via Mars' Rover Credit Accounts to increase the value of the liquidity provided. The vault also auto-compounds rewards into the pool to maximise yield. 

In the event of the pool's value dropping below a declared safety threshold and the position being liquidated, the collateralised assets within the vault are required to be automatically sold. As these assets will be locked in order to receive liquidity incentives this is not possible without allowing the vault addresses to directly bypass this restriction and unlock assets immediately rather than waiting for the bonding period to pass. 

Apollo LP Vaults have been audited by Oak Security and the audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/master/Apollo). 

## Implementation
This proposal directly whitelists the address to be able to bypass bonding periods for assets contained within them, enabling the liquidation of over-leveraged deposits.

"Upload Cross-Chain Swap Contract v2

Passing this proposal will upload an updated version of the Crosschain Swaps contract to the Osmosis chain. 

## Details 
The Crosschain Swaps contract enables trades on Osmosis to be carried out remotely from another chain connected to Osmosis by IBC. 

The original upload contained an issue that was only discovered during implementation on mainnet and requires a new version to be uploaded to properly integrate the full Crosschain swaps process. 

The contract receives a token transfer from chain A, interacts with the Swap Router contract to exchange the received token for a different token and then forwards it to a destination address specified in the original transaction. 

On receipt of tokens from Chain A, the contract parses a memo field, enabled by IBC v3.4.0 in [Osmosis v13](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/370). This contains information set by the sender identifying the instance of the Crosschain Swaps contract to interact with and the intention. 

This Crosschain Swaps instance is linked to an instance of the SwapRouter contract uploaded in [Proposal 411](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/411) and carries out the exchange using liquidity on Osmosis. 

The resultant tokens are then forwarded to the address originally specified in the memo, be that a return to the address on Chain A or forwarding to an address on Chain C.

"Upload StreamSwap Contract

# **Description**

This proposal, upon acceptance, will upload the StreamSwap contract to the Osmosis Zone blockchain.

# **Abstract**

StreamSwap is a protocol for time-based token swaps. In simple words, in an AMM pool, token swaps happen instantly. With StreamSwap, tokens are *streamed* and *swapped* over a fixed period of time.

# Mechanism (short overview)

- StreamSwap swaps require users to create Streams and lock a fixed number of tokens (T1) and swap them for an accepted token (T2) over a fixed-period of time (t)
    - T1 is added by the Streamer (stream creator) and can NOT be added or removed at any point in time until the end of the Streaming Phase (t)
    - T2 is the token that subscribers can add or remove at any point in time
- Bootstrapping Phase — The duration from the stream creation until stream start time is the Bootstrapping Phase. This is when subscribers can use T2 to subscribe. During this phase, no swapping happens.
- Streaming Phase — The duration from the stream start time to the stream end time is the stream duration (t) during which streaming starts & tokens are swapped.
    - T1 is streamed to subscribers that subscribed with T2. T2 is streamed to the user the locked T1. Both tokens can be redeemed only at the end of the stream.
    - The swaps do NOT happen instantly and take place linearly over the duration of the entire stream.
    - A constant number of T1 are streamed as they are locked and T2 are streamed based on the total time remaining and total unspent T2 tokens
    - At the end of the Streaming Phase, subscribers can redeem T1 based on their total contribution of T2 and the time at which they subscribed to the stream.
- Price Discovery — The final price of locked T1 is determined by the total T2 received by the end of the stream.

# **Mechanism (in detail)**

The mechanism enables communities/DAOs/builders to swap tokens at any stage of a project’s lifecycle — before, during or after the token launch. Of the many use cases, the first use case being explored and focused on is the StreamSwap Protocol for community-driven token launches.

## **1) About**

StreamSwap is the protocol for time-based token swaps on Osmosis. It is developed using CosmWasm smart contracts and will be going through the governance process similar to other smart contract deployments on Osmosis Zone.

The protocol is built for token swaps and StreamSwap is being utilized initially for **community-driven token launches** as it enables fair price discovery for the token being streamed.

## **2) Stream Creation**

DAOs/Communities/Users can create Streams by:

- locking tokens to stream out (say, FLIX)
- setting a token to stream in (say, OSMO)
- setting the stream start time and stream end time

## **3) Phases of a stream**

Streams have two phases:

- Bootstrapping Phase
- Streaming Phase

## **4) Deposits and Withdrawals**
- Tokens being streamed out (FLIX in this case), are **locked** during the stream and can NOT be added or removed until the end of the stream.
- After the stream ends, subscribers can redeem the token being streamed out (FLIX) based on the shares that they receive for the token streamed in
- Tokens being streamed in (OSMO in this case), can be deposited or withdrawn at any point in time during the stream, giving subscribers the freedom to exit as they see fit.

## **5) Phase 1 — Bootstrapping Phase**
- Bootstrapping Phase is the period from the “stream creation” time to the “stream start” time.
- Subscribers can subscribe to the stream by depositing tokens being streamed in (OSMO) and receive shares proportionately. No swaps occur during this phase as the streaming does not start.

## **6) Phase 2 — Streaming Phase**
In the Streaming phase, tokens start getting swapped and are streamed at each other.
- Tokens being streamed out (FLIX) and tokens being streamed in (OSMO) are swapped over the duration of the stream.
- During the Streaming Phase, tokens being streamed in (OSMO) are spent when they are swapped. Spent tokens can not be withdrawn but unspent tokens can be withdrawn.

## **7) Price Discovery**
- The final price of the tokens being streamed out (FLIX in this case) is determined by the total tokens streamed in (OSMO) during the Streaming Phase; enabling fair and transparent community-driven price discovery.

## **8) Token Distribution**
Once the Streaming Phase ends, subscribers can redeem the tokens streamed out (FLIX) while the tokens that were streamed in (OSMO) are transferred to the stream creator's treasury (as configured during the Stream creation).

## **9) Advantages when compared to the LBPv1**
- Capital Efficiency — No collateral token required
- Participation Protection — No tokens are released/delivered before the Streaming Phase ends and hence, there is no way for folks to dump their tokens while the streaming happens (which is a major difference when compared to LBPs)
- MEV — MEV will not affect participation, as tokens swaps do NOT happen instantly
- Can’t time your participation right? DCA into a stream by subscribing to it right in the Bootstrapping Phase.

"Lengthen OSMO Emission Schedule

This proposal would lengthen the time taken to reach the maximum OSMO supply by: 
* Reducing daily OSMO emissions by 50% at the next software upgrade
* Signalling approval to double the time between Thirdening events, after the next Thirdening has occurred. 
# Details
OSMO is emitted daily at Epoch and the amount will reduce by a third every 365 epochs (The Thirdening) to an [asymptotic supply of 1 billion OSMO.](https://medium.com/osmosis/osmo-token-distribution-ae27ea2bb4db) 

This initial distribution mechanism was intended to seed early participants in the Osmosis ecosystem with voting power while simultaneously bootstrapping liquidity and security for dapps deploying on Osmosis to utilise. 

The tokenomic model has been subject to change since genesis, most obviously so when the Terra collapse caused Osmosis governance to take a more conservative view of liquidity rewards, redirecting a total of 31.5% of emissions more than originally intended to the community pool in order to defer inflation until it became more sustainable. 

While this reduced circulating inflation and total inflation will continue to reduce each year, total inflation remains at ~35% and the community pool has now reached 69 million OSMO. This proposal intends to speed up the reduction in inflation by implementing a single Halvening event at the next software upgrade and signalling approval for an increase of the time between Thirdenings, after the next Thirdening, to two years (730 epochs). 

This would initially reduce the OSMO emitted at each epoch by half, from 547,945 to 273,973 and, after the next thirdening, maintain a lower rate of emissions of 182,649 per epoch for two years. Lowering inflation whilst maintaining a max supply close to the original tokenomic design. 

# Effect on Max Supply
Reducing daily emissions while leaving the existing thirdening model in place results in a much flatter inflation curve over time after this initial drop. 

[Chart of Inflation Curves](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dd66f5ff-d9db-490a-b986-d369900e3877.1678793221110)

Because of the reduced daily emissions this reduces the asymptotic max supply to around 780,000,000 OSMO depending on when the reduction is implemented. 

[Chart of Max Supply over time](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cf590e55-87a1-44f5-bf48-2b201641b589.1674208175780)

In order to maintain the maximum supply of around 1 billion, the thirdening length would need to be increased in a future governance proposal to maintain this more moderate rate of emissions for longer. This governance proposal also signals approval for this change, which would be implemented in a future parameter change governance proposal after the next thirdening event has occurred. 

This would result in a slightly lowered Maximum Supply of around 980,000,000 OSMO, varying slightly depending on when the initial reduction is implemented. 

[Chart of Max Supply over time with Thirdening Length increase](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/9d5e3131-e2ec-4c4e-81c7-cf2251dec4d6.1679669590844)

# Effect on Rewards
By itself, this proposal would proportionately reduce all emissions to Stakers, Liquidity Providers, the Community Pool and Developers by 50% causing a sudden drop in rewards, similar to the smaller drop at each Thirdening event. This may be too large an impact all at once and so this proposal is combined with two other proposals:

## Combined with Adjusting the Ratio of Emissions
When paired with the Proposal to Adjust the Ratio of Emissions, this results in a change in daily emissions of raw OSMO as follows: 

* Staking Rewards remain static at 136,986
* Pool Incentives decrease from 73,973 to 54,795 (-26%)
* Community Pool decrease from 200,000 to 13,699 (-93%)
* Developer Rewards decrease in line with inflation 136,986 to 68,493 (-50%)

This results in no change for staking rewards with varying levels of cuts to all other areas. This also brings an improvement in the Net Yield for Staking and Liquidity rewards, a reversion of the increased growth of the community pool and a cut to the raw OSMO allocated to developer rewards. The latter, being vested, should see a compensatory benefit from the overall reduced inflation. 

In short, the main reduction will be absorbed by the emissions to the community pool to limit the effects on stakers and liquidity providers. 
## Combined with Decreasing the Superfluid Discount
Further combining with the Proposal to Decrease the Superfluid Discount to 25%, results in a small cut to staking rewards due to the increased number of OSMO able to be staked while compensating Liquidity Providers with greater rewards from Superfluid Staking. 

This also puts greater emphasis on the Superfluid Staking feature of Osmosis, increasing the share of rewards obtained from it compared to normal liquidity incentives as well as further increasing the security of the network.

# Linked Passing Disclaimer

"Adjust the Ratio of Emissions

This proposal signals acceptance of two linked changes to the allocation of daily emissions at epoch to be carried out simultaneously at the next software upgrade. 
* Changing the ratio of emissions to pool incentives from 45% to 20% and staking from 25% to 50%. 
* Changing the proportion of the pool incentives currently being redirected to the community pool from 70% to 0%, leaving the standard 5% allocation from the distribution module in place. 
# Details
All OSMO tokens minted as inflation at epoch are divided between four possible routes. This is currently set in the Mint module as: 
* Staking: 25%
* Pool Incentives: 45%
* Community Pool: 5%
* Developer Rewards: 25%

Further to this, pool incentives have been redirected to the community pool over the last 10 months in order to minimise inflation during the bear market. Because of this the effective emission proportions are currently:
* Staking: 25%
* Pool Incentives: 13.5%
* Community Pool: 36.5%
* Developer Rewards: 25%

This proposal aims to solve two common issues raised with Osmosis tokenomics of the net yield from staking rewards and the net yield from larger liquidity pools being negative by adjusting the proportion of emissions received by each. 

The proposed new ratio would be:
* Staking: 50%
* Pool Incentives: 20%
* Community Pool: 5%
* Developer Rewards: 25%

By also removing the share of Pool Incentives being redirected to the community pool these are identical to the effective emission proportions
# Effect on Net Yield
Changing the emissions in this way causes the Staking Rewards and actual emissions to Liquidity Providers to make up a higher proportion of inflation. Combining regular compounding of rewards with diminishing inflation from a fixed emission schedule, results in a net yield increase when compared to existing inflation as follows:
* Staking Rewards net yield increases from -3.9% to 26.5%
* Liquidity Rewards net yield increases from 9.5% to 20.4%

While this is beneficial to both stakers and Liquidity Providers, it does not solve the common complaint of the high inflation of Osmosis. Therefore this proposal is combined with two others. 
## Combined with Reducing Emissions
When combined with the proposal to Reduce Emissions this changes the raw OSMO emissions to each route as follows:
* Staking Rewards remain static at 136,986
* Liquidity Rewards decrease from 73,973 to 54,795 (-26%)
* Community Pool decrease from 200,000 to 13,699 (-93%)
* Developer Rewards decrease from 136,986 to 68,493 (-50%)

This changes the net yield as follows:
* Staking Rewards net yield increases from -3.9% to 8.4%
* Liquidity Rewards net yield decreases from 9.5% to 8.6%
## Combined with Decreasing the Superfluid Risk Factor
Further combining with the Proposal to Decrease the Superfluid Risk Factor to 25%, results in a small cut to staking rewards due to the increased number of OSMO able to be staked while compensating Liquidity Providers with greater rewards from Superfluid Staking, offsetting the reduction in Pool Incentives emissions from this proposals. 

This also puts greater emphasis on the Superfluid Staking feature of Osmosis, increasing the share of rewards obtained from it compared to normal liquidity incentives as well as further increasing the security of the network. 

This proposal in combination with the reduction in Emissions changes the net yield to: 
* Staking Rewards net yield increases from -3.9% to 6.4%
* Liquidity Rewards net yield increases  from 9.5% to 11.3%

"Decrease the Superfluid Risk Factor to 25%

This proposal signals that a reduction of the Superfluid minimum risk factor parameter to 25% should be implemented at the next software upgrade. This will allow 75% of OSMO in Superfluid pools to be staked. 
# Details
Superfluid staking is a unique feature of Osmosis that allows OSMO locked in liquidity positions the ability to participate in securing the network and voting on proposals. 

This is currently available on most large liquidity pools in Osmosis and causes 37 million, or around 16%, of staked OSMO to come from these positions. 

The mechanism through which this is accomplished is a representative amount of synthetic OSMO being staked on behalf of the locked OSMO. The proportion of this is dictated by a `minimum_risk_factor` parameter that minimises the risk of double counting OSMO when a superfluid-enabled position changes size between the reassessment of its representative OSMO. For a full description of the process see the [module readme](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/superfluid/README.md). 

This has two main functions, it keeps the staking reward earned by the position more uniform by dampening the change in the number of OSMO claiming staking rewards each epoch. More importantly, it increases the cost of voting power attack on the network by discounting the amount of OSMO that an attacker could fake possession of through a double-staking attack. 

As the number of locations that Superfluid Staking is enabled in increases, the less influence a double-staking attack would have as it would cost exponentially more amounts to gain an increasingly smaller share of voting power. With Superfluid staking now active in 23 pools, decreasing this risk factor should be feasible without compromising network security even at a lower level than proposed. 

For a model of this potential attack type see here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eQsf7-6HvdHKbEHOv68SYXZ7\_U22r56ihZVWqupa0Pk/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eQsf7-6HvdHKbEHOv68SYXZ7_U22r56ihZVWqupa0Pk/edit#gid=0) 

This proposal would cause approximately an additional 19 million OSMO to be staked. This would increase the APR of Superfluid pools by around 2% while dropping the Staking APR by around 1.5%. 


In the current scenario where staking net yield is negative and typical Liquidity Rewards are still significantly higher than Staking APR this is not particularly useful for the protocol in itself and so is combined with two other proposals. 
## Combined with Adjusting the Ratio of Emissions
This proposal is most effective when combined with the proposed adjustment of the ratio of emissions. This causes a shift in net yield for stakers and liquidity providers, and combined with this proposal, changes the ratio of liquidity rewards that come from Superfluid Staking, placing more emphasis on this core feature. 

Combining just these two proposals results in an increase in the proportion of liquidity rewards provided by Superfluid Staking. 

As the adjustment of ratio proposal changes the net yield to be far greater for stakers, the additional OSMO being superfluid staked is far less detrimental to pure rewards and increases the security of Osmosis at a lowered cost. 
## Combined with Reducing Emissions
Reducing emissions is not as attached to this proposal, however, the combination of reducing emissions and changing the ratio results in a change in emissions of raw OSMO as follows:
* Staking Rewards remain static at 136,986
* Liquidity Rewards decrease from 73,973 to 54,795 (-26%)
* Community Pool decrease from 200,000 to 13,699 (-93%)
* Developer Rewards decrease in line with inflation 136,986 to 68,493 (-50%)

With an additional 25% of OSMO in superfluid pools being staked, the reduction in raw emissions to liquidity rewards is somewhat compensated for as below:


| Liquidity Yields | Current | Proposed | Change |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Swap APR (Weighted Avg) | 3.9% | 3.9% | 0% |
| Incentive APR (Weighted Avg) | 16.4% | 12.1% | -26% |
| Superfluid APR | 5.5% | 7.6% | 39% |
| Total APR | 25.7%| 23.6% | -8% |

"Allow TFM Contracts to be Uploaded

This proposal gives the address osmo1e0x2hnhhwyek7eq3kcxu2x6pt77wdnwz0lutz9fespdr9utq963qr0y5p5 the ability to upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis without seeking further governance approval for each upload. This address is administered by TFM protocol builders. 

TFM’s contracts have been audited by SCV Security, with [audit reports available to view here](https://tfm.com/terra2/resources/audits) and additional checking as [suitable for Osmosis here](https://gist.github.com/scvsecurity/58d1ebc241ef82ba2a7b63c2b693736e). 

These include a Limit Order contract which provides a more advanced trading experience as well as Router contract which enables the splitting of trades between multiple routes to obtain the optimal price for users by minimising slippage in any one pool. 

Governance approval for contract upload was originally intended to keep the set of DApps running on Osmosis consistent with its objective of being a DeFi hub for the Interchain. 

While this proposal gives authority for osmo1e0x2hnhhwyek7eq3kcxu2x6pt77wdnwz0lutz9fespdr9utq963qr0y5p5 to permissionlessly upload CosmWasm contracts to Osmosis, governance only signals approval for contracts relating to the function of TFM’s trading and aggregation products. 
## About TFM
TFM’s mission is to provide an aggregation service in the crypto space across all major blockchains, bringing convenience and efficiency to projects and users, and driving ecosystems growth and mass adoption. Initially deployed on the Terra blockchain, TFM aims to expand into more networks connected by IBC, and ultimately to EVM and other blockchains.

"Set token creation fee to zero; introduce an alternative spam-prevention mechanism

* Authored by: [larry0x](https://twitter.com/larry0x) and ChatGPT
* [Commonwealth discussion](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10595)

## Background

In Cosmos ecosystem there are two prevailing fungible token standards, the native token and the CW20. Osmosis is equipped with a “tokenfactory” module which allows anyone (human users or smart contracts) to mint native tokens. This is a much desired feature, as native token is superior than CW20 for many reasons which I will not cover here.

Given that Osmosis currently has a very low gas price, tokenfactory needs a mechanism to deter spamming. This means an attacker creating a massive amount of new tokens that take up nodes’ storage space. It does this by charging a fee, currently set at 10 OSMO, whenever a new token is created. This is known as the `denom_creation_fee` in the code.

## The problem

It turns out, that this fee approach makes it harder for smart contracts to integrate with tokenfactory, especially ones that need to repeatedly create new tokens. For example,

- A lending protocol that issues tokens representing collateral or debt positions, needs to pay the fee each time a new collateral or debt asset is added.

- A cross-chain transfer protocol that issues voucher tokens, needs to pay the fee the first time a token is transferred.

Such contracts need to allocate a fee pool for these payments and program relevant payment logics, which in many cases is a non-trivial task.

Note that this complexity has nothing to do with how big the fee is. It is there as long as the fee is non-zero.

## An alternatie solution

Ethan Frey proposed an alternative spam-prevention approach in [this Github issue](https://github.com/CosmWasm/token-factory/issues/11). It suggests that, instead of charging a fee, charge a large amount of gas instead.

From the perspective of the user who creates a new token, there is no difference from the current approach – they pay the same fee, the only difference being whether it’s a `denom_creation_fee` or a gas fee. However, it makes it much easier for smart contract developers.

This approach has been [implemented by Juno](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pull/635) and is expected to be included in its v15 upgrade.

## This proposal

I proposed that Osmosis does the following:

- Introduce the same spam-prevention mechanism, in consistency with Juno’s implementation (most importantly, keep the same protobuf message/query API);

- Set `denom_creation_fee` to zero in the UpgradeHandler of the next chain upgrade.",0.02607058241430175

"Signalling Proposal for JKL/OSMO Incentivized Liquidity Pool: 

## Signalling Proposal for JKL/OSMO Incentivized Liquidity Pool: 

### Overview:

In alignment with external incentives delivered by Jackal Protocol, this proposal aims to enhance the JKL/OSMO liquidity pool on Osmosis. The Jackal Protocol will offer 1 million $JKL external incentives over three months. This proposal requests the inclusion of Pool #832 for OSMO incentives for a fixed three-month period relative to the Osmosis incentives allocation process. 

By voting YES, you express your support for enabling matched OSMO incentives on the JKL/OSMO (#832) liquidity pool on Osmosis for a three-month period.

### Advantages for Osmosis:

The JKL/OSMO liquidity pool has consistently ranked among the top pools in terms of 7-day trading volume and total liquidity for six months. This achievement was made possible despite its limited exposure through the Osmosis Frontier front-end. Ranking within the top 10% of pools in total value locked (TVL) suggests that Osmosis and, ultimately, the Cosmos ecosystem are prepared for a more prominent role for Jackal.

The JKL/OSMO pool (#832) has remained highly profitable since genesis, supported by external incentives from the Jackal Protocol alone. As the ecosystem's only data storage application-specific blockchain, JKL brings unique value to Osmosis users and the broader Cosmos network. With the launch of cloud storage, it's crucial to ensure that users have a more accessible platform for purchasing and trading $JKL. Offering incentives for $JKL on Osmosis, in addition to the external incentives provided by Jackal, can create a mutually beneficial relationship for both ecosystems.

The sustained success of the JKL/OSMO liquidity pool reflects the potential for a fruitful, long-term partnership between Osmosis and Jackal Protocol. By matching the incentives provided by Jackal Protocol, Osmosis can further enhance its platform, draw more users, and solidify its position as a reliable and innovative decentralized exchange.

#### What is the Jackal Protocol? 

The Jackal Protocol is a groundbreaking file storage and sharing protocol, leveraging the power of blockchain technology, the Cosmos SDK, and the Tendermint consensus algorithm to ensure utmost security and control for its users. This innovative protocol enables encrypted storage, tied to an on-chain permission management system that grants users ultimate control over their files. A steadfast commitment to digital privacy and cybersecurity.

By providing an unmatched level of data protection, the Jackal Protocol aims to revolutionize how individuals and enterprises store, share, and manage data in the digital age.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on IST/OSMO & BLD/OSMO

On passing, this proposal would enable Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/BLD (#795) pool and OSMO/IST (#837) pool on Osmosis. 

## Details
Superfluid proposals ask whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance. 

This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/BLD (#795) pool and OSMO/IST (#837) pool. 

If enabled at the current 50% discount rate, an additional ~705 thousand OSMO can be used to secure the network through staking.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/MARS

This proposal is to enable Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/MARS (#907) pool on Osmosis. 

##Details
OSMO/MARS is currently the 7th largest pool on Osmosis, with ~2,100,000 OSMO. At the current 50% discount rate, superfluid staking would allow a further ~1,050,000 OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking. 

## About MARS
Mars protocol is a Money Market and Credit protocol initially launched on Terra that has launched a Cosmos chain as the hub of its operations for the IBC network.
Mars' first outpost operates on Osmosis as the home of the deepest liquidity across IBC and enable users to lend, borrow and earn against Mars governance gated credit lines.

"Signalling Proposal for OSMO/FIL incentivised pool

This is a signalling proposal to include the FIL pool OSMO/FIL (#1006) into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives. After this proposal has passed governance, pool #1006 will be added to the regular incentives program of Osmosis. 

## About FIL
Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that allows anyone to store and retrieve data on the internet. Built-in economic incentives ensure that files are stored and retrieved reliably and continuously for however long a user specifies. 

Filecoin is provided through the Axelar bridge from the Filecoin network. The Filecoin network runs the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a runtime environment for smart contracts written in Solidity.

"Enable Superfluid Staking on SOMM/OSMO

This proposal is to enable Superfluid Staking on the SOMM/OSMO (#627) pool on Osmosis. 

## Details
SOMM/OSMO pool has been on Osmosis since Feb 2022 and currently has 322,167 USD TVL, with ~203,800 OSMO. At the current superfluid risk factor at 50%, superfluid staking would allow a further ~101,900 OSMO to be used to secure the network through staking. 
##About Sommelier
Sommelier is built on the Cosmos SDK to maximize interoperability with other blockchains, and the platform is a reimagined gateway into interchain DeFi. With a bridge in place connecting the Cosmos-based platform to Ethereum, Sommelier will be able to execute strategies across multiple blockchains, opening a wide horizon of possibilities. 

Recently, Sommelier recorded +18.8m USD TVL in strategy vaults after the launch of Real-Yield USD & ETH strategies.

"Funding for Confio, developers of CosmWasm

## **Summary**

$18,000 in $STARS for three months of public goods funding to Confio to maintain Cosmwasm, the smart contract engine that powers Stargaze. The request is for 1,080,000 $STARS, any remainder will be returned to the community pool. 

## **Background**

Confio team, led by Simon Warta, Ethan Frey, and Martin Worner, is an essential part of the Cosmos ecosystem for everything they have delivered as core developers and support to all teams building, Stargaze included. Cosmwasm, an essential part of Cosmos infrastructure, is maintained by Confio. Recently, the team announced they couldn’t continue building public goods from now on.

[https://twitter.com/confio_tech/status/1620780203818754048](https://twitter.com/confio_tech/status/1620780203818754048)

[https://medium.com/confio/confios-new-path-fa82482a9f13](https://medium.com/confio/confios-new-path-fa82482a9f13)

Stargaze acknowledges the work Confio has done and will continue to do as stewards of Cosmwasm. The Stargaze Community would like to extend our help to the Confio Team, who currently has 20-30 people.

## **Cost and Rationale**

The proposal is for $18,000 in $STARS for three months of public goods funding to the Confio Team. After those 3 months have passed, a renewal of this proposal may take place. Other Cosmos projects have made similar proposals to their community. The amount requested is equivalent in proportion to other community proposals. This helps Confio continue operations and work on Cosmwasm.

The upside would be getting support from Confio’s invaluable expertise while also helping a project essential to the Cosmos ecosystem. Every mint and trade on Stargaze relies on Cosmwasm to execute.

### As discussed here:
https://commonwealth.im/stargaze/discussion/9924-developer-royalties-update

### Summary
This is to update the Developer Royalties distribution in order to provide a higher incentive for developers to build on Stargaze. This fee is included in the Fairburn mechanism when a developer's custom contract is utilized.

### Currently:
How does Fair Burn work?

All fees received by Stargaze are 100% Fair Burned. That means when no developer royalty is present:
-50% of $STARS are burned
-50% STARS are returned to stakers

Developer royalties are within the first half, which means the current distribution looks like this:
-10% dev royalties
-40% burned
-50% returned to stakers

### Proposed:
When no developer royalty is present (No Change):
-50% of $STARS are burned
-50% of $STARS are returned to stakers

When Developer Royalties are present:
-50% dev royalties
-50% burned


### Vote

Both parties must have bet the same amount (available in increments determined at instantiation). The winner of the wager gains all of the funds deposited, minus a set percentage for service fees and fair burn, both of which are set at instantiation and can be updated by the contract admin.

Party 1 submit their intentions to start a wager to the contract, which matches them immediately if another party's submission matches their specific conditions. If none are available, Party 1 is added to the matchmaking pool, and their wager will be started when a suitable opponent is found. The time in seconds for a matchmaking item to expire can be set at instantiation.

Example:

- _stars1...abc_ has a $STARS Pixel Wizard and wants to bet against $OSMO or $JUNO for 30m.
- _stars1...9fg_ has a $JUNO Pixel Wizard and wants to bet against $STARS, $OSMO or $BTC for 30m.

The contract will match both of these users, and a cosmjs agent will determine the winner of the wager based on data made publicly available by the Pixel Wizards [Knowledge API](https://api.pixelwizards.art/), with prices pulled every two minutes from Coingecko's API.

"Stargaze Tokenomics Update 2.0

This is a multi-step process that addresses tokenomic concerns and proposes a general overhaul of the STARS token with the goal to:

Reduce total inflation by 60%
Achieve a Net Staking Yield of ~+7% to no longer dilute STARS stakers.
Lower the max supply from 4B STARS to 3B.
Reach tail-end token emission (95% of max supply) by the year 2027 vs. 2040 (1 year thridening period vs. 3 year thirdening period)

Process to implement (4 proposals):
Prop 1: Reduce inflation by 60% with a One-OFF Emissions Cut that would reduce daily emission from ~1.8M STARS to ~730K STARS and would drop the inflation rate from ~33% to ~11%
Prop 2 - Use Community Pool Funds to supplement the emissions cut.
Prop 3 - Redirect token emission from the bloated Community Pool towards staking. Adjust the token emission allocation to NFT-DeFi primitives as these features become available.
Prop 4 - Change the FairBurn mechanism for NFT listing fees & Stargaze Name minting fees.

Reasoning:
Greatly reduces inflation and brings it to a healthy level
Benefits Net Staking Yield where staking would outpace inflation
Community Pool funds can’t be used right now for large expenses without heavily negatively impacting token price
Community Pool funding request in Prop 2 does not introduce heavy sell pressure and distributes funds to the community.
Users of $STARS (stakers, NFT traders and holders) will be less impacted by the issuance of new $STARS tokens

"Stargaze v10 upgrade

# Stargaze v10 Upgrade

New Modules:
- x/cron
- x/globalfee


This upgrade includes version updates to CosmWasm, ibc-go and the sdk.
- SDK v0.45.16
- ibc-go 4.4.2
- Wasmd v0.31.0
- Tendermint v0.34.27 (Comet Fork)


### Cron Module
The cron module allows smart contracts to receive begin and end blocker callbacks through sudo messages, enhancing functionality. However, this requires extra permissions from governance and on a case-by-case basis since this a privileged access that should only be given to a small set of smart contracts .


### Global Fee Module
The global fee module has some similarities to Cosmos Hub module, with some additional configurations that allow specific smart contracts to keep utilizing zero gas, these configuratios are mantained by governance and an allowed list of addresses. Why is zero gas still important? Minting and Trading utilize Fair Burn mechanics, where the cost of storage and minting is covered by fees paid through these methods. For example, creating a collection has a fee of 3,000 STARS, listing 0.5 STARS, additionally 5% fee for mints and 2% trading fees.

The upgrade comes with a min-gas-price of 1ustars (micro STARS), and here are some values for reference:
- 1ustars  = 0.000001 STARS
- 1ustars ~= 0.0014uatom = 0.0000000014 ATOM
- 1ustars ~= 0.025uosmo = 0.000000025 OSMO

Why are fees essential for the remaining activity? Stargaze is evolving to support different products and protocols that don't necessarily use Fair Burn or built-in fee mechanics. To prevent attacks on the network is essential to introduce fees to remaining network activity. 


## Important Upgrade Notes
It's important that before running the v10 binary the wasm cache must be cleared. 

# Details of upgrade time
This proposal suggests block #8576398 for the upgrade, which is estimated to be at Thursday 8th June 17:30 UTC, using avg block time of 5.87 secs https://www.mintscan.io/stargaze/blocks/8576398
When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine of the blockchain will be halted. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used for v10.0.0, and then the chain will continue to make progress.
In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we will coordinate via the #verified-validators channel in Discord.

"Accelerating LUNC Burns

The main aim of this proposal is to burn more LUNC. In my opinion, the contribution of each validator in the burning of LUNC should be determined. In front of the name of each validator, it should be specified what percentage of its own interest/commission rates has been allocated to burning LUNC whether with a 1% commission or a 5% or a 10% or whatsoever. As “Voting Power” and “Commission” rows, a new row should be added something like “Commission Burned” or “CBurned” or “CB”.
It will have the following consequences: 
1-Allows delegators to choose better validators for delegating.
2-Encourages LUNC validators to burn more of this coin.
3-Much more of this coin will be burned.
4-Voting power is distributed among validators in a more appropriate way.

no veto I’d like to burn it or have it be heard ❤️




From following everything 
Lunc is great shape and health even with all news circulating
Ustc will continue to work towards $1 on its own and supporting and holding I think is necessary




Would it be possible to implement a system to limit shorts? In general if this was my baby that I built i wouldn’t appreciate it but I total understand it’s necessary 




This is something the lunc token would inherit using burnt coins of some new mechanic, new wallet that would be used on daily case randomly to create some randomness but only once every 24 hour period. So technically when the mechanic hit at 1st 11:59pm  and then again at 2nd 12:01 am then mechanic would hit between 3rd 12:01am-11:59pm - with accumulation technically from the 2d 12:02am -11:59pm adding to the 3rds amount because it’s just waiting for the programming to work but hey big one coming up




The mechanic would use some grid funds or some of tax maybe a combination of both, but I know digging into the tax is unliked but I think it’s worth the idea. not a lot could start of minimal and then experimented with on random days 




At the end of the day all assets will still be burnt, a buying bot but griding first before burning, token sent to this wallet will get put into a grid to stabilize price and each tax would cover a different area(would only burn once the price returns the original entry price or higher, if lower it becomes a holding bot, the lender is the station in house to increase network usage constantly 




Also have NFT album sidelined privatized that if anyone looking to contact for a collaboration 🙌 been waiting for the network I wanted to have them built on

"Expanded & Finalized L1 Task Force [v3] (Q2, 2023)

To fill the senior leadership gap left by the departure of Prof. Ed Kim and the removal of Mr. Tobias Andersen, we propose bringing in Bilbo Baggins (senior software engineer/architect) and Solid Snake (another senior engineer and systems architect), both of whom will serve as team co-leads. In addition to them, we propose adding another 3 senior developers to the team (NotJoshC, MangoChutney, ChopstickSensei) all of whom are seasoned developers with years of experience under their belts, and will have no trouble fitting into the group. Finally, we propose adding Jacob Gadikian (senior developer and CEO of Notional Labs) to this roster as a retainer, for the purpose of external collaboration and high-level overview (code review and Cosmos-specific implementation), as Jacob has already contributed much to the blockchain and his expertise will prove invaluable in helping us reach parity.

We need to scale up our L1 team if we are to prepare LUNC for the coming bull run!

Ergo, here is the proposed budget for Q2:

$7,500/month for Bilbo Baggins x 3 months = $22,500 overall for Q2
$7,500/month for SolidSnake x 3 months = $22,500 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for NotJoshC x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for MangoChutney x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for ChopstickSensei x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2
$5,000/month for Jacob Gadikian x 3 months = $15,000 overall for Q2

Total expenditure for Q2: $105,000, paid out in 2 installments!
(or 853,658,536.585365 LUNC at a conversion rate of 0.000123)

This money is to be paid out in 2 equal installments! If this proposal passes, the first installment would be released immediately upon the proposal’s passing so the work can commence. The second installment would be put up for a vote in its own prop after 8 weeks have passed, to allow the community to judge the work delivered over 2 months. This ensures the community pool is protected from a one-time drain, as well as incentivizes the developers with delayed payouts for completing their roadmap!

Decentralization is a key aspect of blockchain technology and is essential for ensuring the security and reliability of the network. However, as the Kava network continues to grow, we are witnessing a concentration of power in the hands of a few large validators.
Currently, the top 4 validators control more than 44% of the voting power  meaning that any proposal can pass or fail with just their support. In our opinion, this is not a truly decentralized blockchain.
We reached out to Kava community on discord about the immense amount control in the hands of a few. We were informed that the top 4 validators do not vote on any proposal. We really appreciate that from the top 4 validators, but we believe in true decentralization. Trusting someone to be responsible has not worked very well lately.
This is not true **DECENTRALIZATION** if we just **HOPE** that the largest validators do not vote to harm the network.

**Solution**:
Currently, trends suggest that delegators flock to validators offering 0%/unsustainably low commission. This makes it very difficult for validators with a small number of delegators to stay competitive, as validators rely on commissions to cover the expenses of maintaining their nodes.

To address this issue, we propose setting a minimum validator commission rate of 5%. This will create a more level playing field and help to ensure that smaller and newer validators are able to participate in the network, promoting a more diverse and decentralized network.
The top validators continue to accumulate a larger share of Delegations while the bottom 95% of validators are forced to cut costs, reducing the overall security of the network.

Let’s look at a real example of these costs:
The minimum hardware costs for a validator are ~$200 per month, while more advanced and secure configurations (ex; Sentry) can cost anywhere between $600-800/month (including maintenance).
Let’s look at an average validator (Validator at rank #51)
Total Stake = 141,737 Kava
Approximate Staking Reward = 141,737 X 21% = 29,764 Kava
If this validator earns 5% commission = 29,764 x 5% = 1,488 Kava = $1,500 = $125 per month
*Stats as of 2/8/2023**

This makes it challenging for validators to maintain the minimum server requirements, let alone add additional security features like a Sentry node architecture.
A more competitive and diverse group of validators will add to the network’s decentralization, increase its’ security, and make it more resistant to malicious actors. As a community, we have a responsibility to take actions that reinforce the security of the Kava network. Setting a minimum commission (similar to those set for other Cosmos IBC networks) is a simple step towards achieving a truly decentralized Kava Network.

**Reference**: Juno implemented a Minimum Validator Commission feature (originally copied from Stargaze). We can use the same approach. Please see [MinCommissionDecorator](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/blob/main/app/decorators/min_commission.go)

**Vote Yes** – If you want a decentralized and secured Kava Network
**Vote Abstain** - If you do not wish to express an opinion but would like to contribute to the quorum
**Vote No** – If you only want to maximize your rewards, at the cost of reduced security and increased centralization
**Vote No With Veto** – If you are against this proposal and want to penalize the proposer for trying to achieve true decentralization on Kava network",0.17343659497210248
