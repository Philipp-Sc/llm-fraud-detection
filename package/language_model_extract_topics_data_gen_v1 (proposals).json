Stakeholders may be disadvantaged by informational or resource-based asymmetries, while other entities may exploit these same asymmetries to capture value controlled by the Cosmos Hub‚Äôs governance mechanisms.\n\nWe‚Äôre concerned that without establishing community standards, processes, and driving decentralized delegator-based participation, the Cosmos Hub governance mechanism could be co-opted by a centralized power. As governance functionality develops, potential participants will need to understand how to assess proposals by knowing what to pay attention to.\n\n_Solution_\nWe‚Äôre forming a focused, diverse group that‚Äôs capable of assessing and synthesizing the key parts of a proposal so that the voting community can get a fair summary of what they need to know before voting.\n\nOur solution is to initiate a Cosmos governance working group that develops decentralized community governance efforts alongside the Hub‚Äôs development. We will develop and document governance features and practices, and then communicate these to the broader Cosmos community.\n\n_Future_\nAt the end of Q1, we‚Äôll publish recommendations for the future of the Cosmos GWG, and ideally we‚Äôll be prepared to submit a proposal based upon those recommendations for Q2 2020. We plan to continue our work in blockchain governance, regardless of whether the Hub passes our proposals.\n\n-=-=-\n\nCosmos forum: https://forum.cosmos.network/c/governance\nCosmos GWG Telegram channel: https://t.me/hubgov\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CosmosGov",false],["CommunityPoolSpendProposal\n#25  -  üü¢\nCosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades\nVoting Start: Tue, 12 May 2020 21:34:51 UTC\nVoting End: Tue, 26 May 2020 21:34:51 UTC\nüëç 99.99%, üëé 0%, üïäÔ∏è 0%, ‚ùå 0% \\n\nCosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades\n\nCommunity-spend proposal submitted by Ethan Frey (https://github.com/ethanfrey ‚ö†Ô∏è ) of Confio UO (http://confio.tech/ ‚ö†Ô∏è ) and CosmWasm (https://www.cosmwasm.com ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è )\n\n-=-=-\n\nFull proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ö†Ô∏è \nForum Post: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-cosmwasm-on-cosmos-hub/3629 ‚ö†Ô∏è \n\n-=-=-\n\nAmount to spend from the community pool: 25000 ATOMs\n\nTimeline: 2-4 months from approval\n\nDeliverables:\n1.
