A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders’ time having to review the proposal).\n\nIn the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.\n\nWe instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If >33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors.  This proposal does not make any change to the current behavior for proposals that fail to meet quorum; if a proposal fails to meet quorum its deposit will be burned.",false],["Activate the Community Pool\n\nEnable governance to spend funds from the community pool.

We deem the issue to be of high severity, as if exploited it can potentially degrade the security model of the chain's Proof of Stake system.  This vulnerability CANNOT lead to the theft of Atoms or creation of Atoms out of thin air. \n\n All in Bits has released a source code patch, Gaia v0.34.6, that closes the exploitable code path starting at block 482100. \n\n The proposed upgrade code Git hash is:  80234baf91a15dd9a7df8dca38677b66b8d148c1 \n\n As a proof of stake, we are putting some collateral behind this legitimacy of this bug and patch and encourage others familiar with the report to do so as well.  If the disclosed bug turns out to be fabricated or malicious in some way, we urge the Cosmos Hub governance to slash these Atoms by voting NoWithVeto on this proposal. \n\n We encourage validators and all users to upgrade their nodes to Gaia v0.34.6 before block 482100.  In the absence of another public bulletin board, we request validators to please vote Yes on this proposal AFTER they have upgraded their nodes to v0.34.6, as a method of signalling the readiness of the network for the upgrade.",false],["Increase Max Validator Set Size to 125\n\nRead here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRhQycV19QiTQGLuPzPHfJwCioj1wDeHHtZvxiHegTFDd \n\nThis proposal supercedes proposal number 9, which contains conflicting numbers in the title and body. \n\nIn the Cosmos Hub, the total number of active validators is currently capped at 100, ordered by total delegated Atoms. This number was originally proposed in the Cosmos whitepaper section titled [Limitations on the Number of Validators](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#limitations-on-the-number-of-validators 4). This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet.  \n\nHowever, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of <7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set.  \n\nIn the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases. Future increases to the validator set size will be originated through governance.",false],["Are Validators Charging 0% Commission Harmful to the Success of the Cosmos Hub?\n\nThis governance proposal is intended to act purely as a signalling proposal.  Throughout this history of the Cosmos Hub, there has been much debate about the impact that validators charging 0% commission has on the Cosmos Hub, particularly with respect to the decentralization of the Cosmos Hub and the sustainability for validator operations. \n\n Discussion around this topic has taken place in many places including numerous threads on the Cosmos Forum, public Telegram channels, and in-person meetups.  Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. \n\n There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission.  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 \n\n This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum.  It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. \n\n We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here:  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 \n\n Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. \n\n The question on this proposal is “Are validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?”.

For example, a single address could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No. Clients may opt into supporting this feature, as the existing UX of voting for a single option is preserved.\n\nThis is beneficial because oftentimes the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company or organization that owns an address might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power.\n\nAnother example use case is exchanges and custodians. Many custodians and exchanges custody multiple customers’ ATOMs in the same address and use this address to stake on behalf of them. However, because of this, it makes it infeasible to do 'passthrough voting' and give their customers voting rights over their tokens, if different customers have different voting preferences. With this new proposal, custodians can use split votes to accurately reflect the preferences of their customers in on-chain governance.\n\nThe technical architecture for this feature can be seen in ADR 037 to the Cosmos SDK: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-037-gov-split-vote.md \n\nAcceptance of this governance proposal is signalling approval to adopt this feature in a future upgrade of the Cosmos Hub.",false],["Funding for Development of Governance Split Votes\n\nSikka is requesting 1776 ATOMs from the community pool to architect and implement the Governance Split Votes feature proposed in Cosmos Hub Proposal #31.

In the battle to build and ship IBC this central vision has remained unchanged, but with so much focus on the need to build out other zones with real economies to support this network (the CosmosSDK is the result of this effort), the idea of the hub as an Interchain Router hasn't been discussed in a serious context for quite a while.\n\nThis is understandable: Cosmos needed so many other pieces to come together before the Hub had a chance to even start performing this function. Those other zones have been created, they each have products and economies. The bootstrapping era of IBC is well underway.\n\nThese new zones joining are noticing a problem: they need to maintain a large amount of infrastructure (archive nodes and relayers for each counterparty chain) to connect with all the chains in the ecosystem, a number that is continuing to increase quickly.\n\nLuckly this problem has been anticipated and IBC architected to accomodate multi-hop transactions. However, a packet forwarding/routing feature was not in the initial IBC release. This proposal aims to fix this for the Hub.\n\nThis is a proposal to include a new feature to IBC on the Hub that allows for multi-hop packet routing for ICS20 transfers. By appending an intermediate address, and the port/channel identifiers for the final destination, clients will be able to outline more than one transfer at a time.\n\nStrangelove Ventures has delivered an [IBC Middleware module](https: //github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/373) that will allow the hub to play the role of IBC Router that was always envisioned for it. Passing of this propsal will begin the era of the Hub offering interchain services to other chains and profiting from those relationships.\n\nTo pay the hub validators and stakers, this proposal implements a governance configurable fee (which we propose should be initially set to 0.0 to encourage adoption) that will be taken out of each packet and given to the community pool. The community pool will then periodically trade these fees for ATOM and distribute them to staked holders. The exact distribution method of these fees is left TBD in this proposal as it is not initially required and can be implemented in a future governance proposal. One way to do this would be using the [Groups module](https: //docs.cosmos.network/master/architecture/adr-042-group-module.html), Community spend proposals and the Gravity DEX.\n\nA vote YES on this proposal indicates that this feature should be included in the next hub upgrade.

The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor) to swap the binaries automatically.

It means there is no record of discussion that voters can confidently point to for context, potentially leading to governance decisions becoming delegitimized by stakeholders.\n\nThe requested amount will be sent to a multisig comprising individuals (members listed below) who can ensure that the tokens are spent judiciously. We believe stewardship of the forum requires:\n\n* **Moderation**: Format, edit, and categorize posts; Standardize titles and tags; Monitor and approve new posts; Archive posts.\n* **Facilitation**: Ask clarifying questions in post threads; Summarize discussions; Provide historical precedence to discussions.\n* **Engagement**: Circulate important posts on other social channels to increase community participation; Solicit input from key stakeholders.\n* **Guidance**: Orient and assist newcomers; Guide proposers through governance process; Answer questions regarding the forum or Cosmos ecosystem.\nThe work to steward the forum will be carried out by members of [Hypha Worker Co-op](https://hypha.coop/) and individuals selected from the community to carry out scoped tasks in exchange for ATOM from this budget.\n## Multisig Members\n* Hypha: Mai Ishikawa Sutton (Hypha Co-op)\n* Validator: Daniel Hwang (Stakefish)\n* Cosmos Hub developer: Lauren Gallinaro (Interchain Berlin)\n\nWe feel the membership of the multisig should be rotated following the six-month pilot period to preserve insight from the distinct specializations (i.e., Cosmos Hub validators and developers).\n## Timeline and Deliverables\nWe estimate the total work to take 250-300 hours over six months where we hope to produce:\n* **Moving summaries:** Provide succinct summaries of the proposals and include all publicly stated reasons why various entities are choosing to vote for/against a given proposal. These summaries will be written objectively, not siding with any one entity.\n* **Validator platforms:** Create a section of the Forum where we collate all validators' visions for Cosmos Hub governance to allow them to state their positions publicly. We will work with the smaller validators to ensure they are equally represented.\n* **Regular check-ins with the Cosmonaut DAO:** Collaborate with the future Cosmonaut DAO to ensure maximal accessibility and engagement. Community management is a critical, complementary aspect of increasing participation in governance.\n* **Announcement channel:** Create a read-only announcement channel in the Cosmos Community Discord, so that new proposals and major discussions can be easily followed.\n* **Tooling friendly posts:** Tag and categorize posts so that they can be easily ingested into existing tooling that validators have setup.\n* **Neutral moderation framework:** Document and follow transparent standards for how the forum is moderated.\n\nAt the end of the period, we will produce a report reflecting on our successes and failures, and recommendations for how the work of maintaining a governance venue can be continuously sustained (e.g., through a DAO). We see this initiative as a process of discovery, where we are learning by doing.\n\nFor more context, you can read through the discussions on this [proposal on the Discourse forum](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-activate-governance-discussions-on-the-discourse-forum-using-community-pool-funds/5833).\n\n## Governance Votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n**YES** - You approve this community spend proposal to deposit 1000 ATOM to a multisig that will spend them to improve governance discussions in the Discourse forum.\n**NO** - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form (please indicate why in the Cosmos Forum).\n**NO WITH VETO** - You are strongly opposed to this change and will exit the network if passed.\n**ABSTAIN** - You are impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\n## Recipient\ncosmos1xf2qwf6g6xvuttpf37xwrgp08qq984244952ze\n## Amount\n1000 ATOM\n\n***Disclosure**: Hypha has an existing contract with the Interchain Foundation focused on the testnet program and improving documentation.

We examine the technical context and existing discussion on ‘NoWithVeto’, and the range of ways the community understands NoWithVeto. We bridge these ideas into a coherent and thorough definition proposed below.\n\nIf passed, changes will be made to the Cosmos Hub documentation and Cosmos Hub Forum templates to reflect the newly accepted definition.\n\n# Proposed Definition for NoWithVeto\n\n***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***\n\nNote: In this definition we use the term “rules of engagement” to refer to practices adopted by the Cosmos Hub community through governance. These may include decision-making processes and social protocols that have passed governance and thus been accepted as rules.\n\nThe following is factually correct about how ‘NoWithVeto’ currently operates and will continue to operate regardless of this proposal’s outcome: If quorum is met and greater than 1/3 of participating voting power have voted ‘NoWithVeto’, the proposal fails and is considered to be vetoed. In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.\n\n# Discussion\n## Summary of existing definitions\nThis list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.\n\n1. **As a stronger No:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.\n2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.\n3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple >1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.\n4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).\n5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.\n6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.\n\n## Censorship\nIt may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3% of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2% of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.\n\n## Financial and social cost\n‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2% of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.\n\nConsequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. \n\nWhile there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.\n\n# Conclusion\nWe are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.\n\nCosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.\n\n# Voting options\nWe propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:\n\n***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***\n\nYour vote on this proposal indicates the following:\n* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.\n* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.

This has been reflected in the engineering efforts by various core entities including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems as well as initial users Quicksilver and Neutron. ICS allows for a provider chain, such as the Cosmos Hub, to share security and have its validators produce blocks for a consumer chain.\nICS is a complex technology that needs to be rigorously tested. To ensure successful rollout, we are launching an incentivized public testnet where Cosmos Hub validators can participate and build confidence around this technology. Game of Chains will build on the Cosmos Hub’s legacy of running successful adversarial testnet programs in the past including [Game of Zones](https://github.com/cosmosdevs/GameOfZones) and [Game of Stakes](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/).\nWe believe the community will see ICS as a valuable addition to Cosmos Hub for three core reasons. First, it allows for “hub minimalism.” By deploying features on a consumer chain instead of Cosmos Hub, we keep the hub lightweight and reduce the surface area for attacks and vulnerabilities. Second, Interchain Security lowers the barrier for ATOM aligned app chains to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. Instead of arranging their own validator set, new app chains can utilize the Cosmos Hub’s existing validator for security. And lastly, Interchain Security accrues value to ATOM and enhances its utility. As new Interchain Secured zones launch, gas fees on these new chains flow back to ATOM stakers through the Hub’s validators.\n## Incentivized Testnet\nFor a successful launch, validators will need to prepare and train for expanding their node operations and governance efforts for every new Interchain Secured chain starting up. We are proposing an incentivized public testnet program that will serve the dual purposes of (1) testing Interchain Security in mainnet-like conditions and (2) providing Cosmos Hub validators the opportunity to build confidence around running the Interchain Security protocol.\nIn order to prevent delays and adequately prepare for launch, we believe it is critical for all Cosmos Hub validators to participate in this public testnet.

Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.\n\nFinally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.\n\n### Governance\n\nMembers define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.\n\nSee our website for more information about Adan's governance and [Board of Directors 3](https://adan.eu/en/association/governance).\n\nAdan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).\n\n### Works & Publications\n\nAdan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.\n\nAdan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.\n\nIn just two short years, Adan has produced an astounding amount of writing and [publications](https://adan.eu/en/publications) to support its mission:\n\n- [A crypto-euro issued by an American giant, or how Europe is delegating its monetary sovereignty](https://adan.eu/en/tribune-les-echos-crypto-euro-en)\n- [EU framework for crypto-asset markets: the French Presidency ends with political deals on MiCA and TFR](https://adan.eu/en/press-release-policy-agreements-mica)\n- [Adan's Response to IOSCO's Retail Market Conduct Report](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/en/response-report-iosco-retail-market)\n- [Adoption of TFR in the European Parliament: the fight against financial crime should not be a fight against crypto-assets](https://adan.eu/en/press/tfr-travel-rule-vote-european-parliament-europeen-econ-libe)\n- [MiCA vote in the European Parliament: A step forward or backward for the crypto sector?](https://adan.eu/en/press-release/european-parliament-mica-compromise-crypto)\n- [Adan responds to the EBA consultation on its draft guidelines for remote onboarding customer solutions 1](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/response-guidelines-eba-onboarding-solutions)\n- [Ban of Proof-of-Work protocols: wrong answer to real global environmental challenges](https://adan.eu/en/position/pow-bitcoin-ban-eu-inappropriate-answer)\n- [Adan's position on FATF's updated guidance for a risk-based approach 1](https://adan.eu/en/position/fatf-updated-guidance-vasp)\n\n## Proposal details\n\nThe crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.\n\nTo this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:\n\n- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.\n- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.\n- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.\n- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).\n\nTo overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:\n\n- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda\n- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups\n- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)\n- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests\n\nGiven the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWe believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.\n\nThis report will be delivered to you via this forum. It will consist of different sections, such as :\n\n- actions carried out in the last months;\n- missions to be carried out in the coming months;\n- distribution of the remaining allocation.\n\n## Funding Amount\n\nTotal amount requested: 8,000 ATOM\n\nThis corresponds to roughly 100,000 EUR and covers gross salary, recruitment costs, and travel expenses for half a year.\n\n## Receipient\n\ncosmos1kdff80vxuj0zmmjauymzjs40hsfkuya79s8tm0\n\n## IPFS\n\nQmR1q2i48EJqaZSXxgggE8VaPKsZFtozVBPHKejMpJAYXx\n\n## Governance Discussion\n\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-adan-non-profit-fighting-for-sound-crypto-regulation/7416\n\n## Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n- YES - You agree that persuading regulators to adopt sound and proportional regulation is important and thus wish to fund Adan's work\n- NO - You don't agree that persuading regulators is important and thus do not agree to fund Adan's work\n- NO WITH VETO - A 'NoWithVeto' vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

The proposed solution was to have a direct mint of tokens to a treasury pool.\n\nHowever, the Hub already has a Community Pool that has been used in the past for various community spend proposals. This pool is funded through taxation on a per-block basis. The current tax rate is 2%. By increasing this we can achieve a similar outcome of expanding the pool of funds available for public good funding, without the immediate creation of a new entity or the bulk minting of ATOM.\n\nThis proposal aims to increase inflows to the Community Pool to make it more in line with what we see around the ecosystem and to ensure that funding for future endeavours are secured. This is merely just a first step and more improvements will come later.\n\n## Community Pools comparison\n\nAs a chain, the Cosmos Hub has a fairly small community pool compared to its market capitalisation:\n\nCosmos Hub - 1.24M ATOMs ~ $13M / Market Cap $3.1BN\n\nOsmosis - 52.13M OSMO ~ $60.4M / Market Cap $560M\n\nJuno - 15.73M JUNO ~ $37.3M / Market Cap $150M\n\nStargaze - 445M STARS ~ $20.5M / Market Cap $60M\n\nLooking at other projects across the Cosmos Ecosystem, the Hub has a small community pool compared to its market cap at just 0.41%.\n\nLooking at other ecosystems similar to that of Cosmos, we can find Polkadot (DOT). Polkadot has a market cap of $6.7BN dollars with a treasury pool of roughly 38M DOT which equates to $230M. This figure equates to 3.4% of its total market cap. This large pool of funds is used to fund the growth of the ecosystem through grants, development funding and also community building.\n\nOn the Cosmos Hub these sorts of proposals are hard to come by due to the limited amount of funds of its community pool, and also social cost required to engage with the community. The ATOM 2.0 proposal suggested that a Treasury be created and be bootstrapped with 4M tokens at with every approved vote up to a maximum of 10 tranches. Ultimately the idea of initially minting 4M to the community pool came into the limelight. However, various community members were still uneasy about minting such an amount due to dilution effects.\n\nThe system as it is currently has its flaws but also works. Until consensus on that solution is found regarding the future of inflation and if / when ATOM becomes deflationary, we, **Simply Staking**, are proposing increasing the community pool tax from the current 2% to 10% as that will help bootstrap the community pool organically without too much compromise to inflationary yield.\n\n## Community Pool Tax\n\nCurrent rate of Issuance: 9.6ATOM per block according to x/mint\n\nCurrent amount of blocks per year: 4,360,000\n\nInstead of the current 0.192ATOM being transferred per block to the pool with the 2% tax, with a tax rate set at 10% we would see around 11,460 ATOM per day (0.96 ATOM per block) get moved to the community pool. Over a year this would allocate around ~4.2M ATOM to the community pool.\n\n## How will this increase affect staking rewards?\n\nWith every block, staking rewards are minted. A percentage of those rewards are diverted to the community pool and then the rest to the stakers. Increasing the tax rate from 2% to 10% will decrease the rewards that stakers will receive by around 8% (from roughly 21% right now to 19.4%)\n\nThe premise here is that the value generated by a strong community pool, public good funding and ecosystem development will vastly exceed the yearly single digit % loss in rewards by stakers.\n\n**Link to the Forum discussion** - [Increasing Hub Community Tax](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2022-12-05-increasing-hub-community-tax/8267/90)\n\n**Voting:**\n\n* By voting **YES**, you agree that the community pool tax rate should be changed to 10%.\n* By voting **NO**, you disagree that the community pool tax rate should be changed to 10%.\n* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you express no opinion on the matter.\n* A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance",false],["Cosmos Ecosystem News Videos\n\n## **Cosmos Ecosystem News Videos**\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- Cosmic Validator is a long-term Cosmos ecosystem focused validator that started validating the Cosmos Hub in 2019 itself, during the first year of mainnet launch\n- We seek 300 ATOM in a monthly funding, for a period of 6 months to continue producing high quality Cosmos Hub & ecosystem news videos\n\n## **Cosmic Validator**\n\nWe have been really involved within the Cosmos ecosystem and its community for several years already before the Cosmos Hub launch or the Game of Stakes.

This event is expected to happen in Q1 2023.\n\nThis is a community pool spend proposal seeking approval to fund **20000 ATOMs** worth of incentives for the Game of NFTs **Phase 1 - Interchain NFTs incentivized testnets** - to reward participants.\n\n# Background - Interchain NFTs \n\nThe Interchain NFTs technology can facilitate interoperability and expands the capabilities of IBC by allowing cross-chain NFT interoperability between IBC-enabled chains, which is the work of multi-team efforts supported by the Interchain Foundation. \n\nWith collaborative efforts from ICF, IRISnet, Gravity Bridge, Stargaze, Ark Protocol and many community teams, it has Cosmos SDK and CosmWasm implementations that can be easily adopted by Cosmos SDK Chains including Cosmos Hub or CosmWasm Chains to expand their interconnections across the ecosystem. \n\nIn November 2022, the first IBC NFT transfer between two test chains using different implementations of ICS721 was successfully executed on testnets. This marked a significant step forward for the IBC NFT ecosystem demonstrating the NFT interoperability between Cosmos SDK (Go) and CosmWasm (Rust) chains. \n\nNFTs have now captured the attention of various industries as well as Cosmos stakeholders. Similar to fungible tokens, if NFTs are just tied to one blockchain, the number of transactions and size of the NFT market would be restricted. To remedy this and unleash the next level of Cosmos NFT, high connectivity and interoperability are required. This is where Interchain NFTs enter the picture. We believe that Interchain NFTs and the community collaboration around them are expanding the mindshare and market share for Cosmos. \n\nMore details about Interchain NFTs: [Interchain NFTs are Coming to Cosmos | by Interchain | The Interchain Foundation | Medium 4](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/interchain-nfts-are-coming-to-cosmos-e01e3abe3d37) \n\n# Game of NFTs \n\nThe Interchain NFTs technology requires rigorous testing with the community involved. To boost the IBC NFT ecosystem, we’re proposing to launch a Game of NFTs event, which will build on the success of previous programs including [Game of Stakes 6](https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes) and [Game of Zones 1](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/), as well as the ongoing [Game of Chains 1](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022). The event is expected to have two phases: \n* Phase 1: Public Incentivized Testnets, for chains and service providers to test around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around February 2023. \n* Phase 2: A Hackathon, for developers to create tools, dApps and use cases around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around March 2023. \n\n## Public Incentivized Testnets - Phase 1 \n\nMany talented teams are contributing to the IBC NFT ecosystem, and have plans to deploy this Interchain NFTs technology. To facilitate wide adoption and successful deployment to capture more value to the Interchain, Phase 1 of the Game of NFTs event is designed to provide mainnet-like environments for purposes on a) testing the performance and capability of Interchain NFTs feature, and b) building trust in Interchain NFTs and preparing for its deployment in the mainnet environments. \n\nThe Interchain NFTs technology is crucial to facilitate interoperability and use cases of IBC, and will capture more value and use cases for both Cosmos-SDK and Wasm chains in Cosmos. By bringing this proposal up, we believe in the Interchain, Cosmos Hub is always a pioneer that takes the lead to pays attention to innovative technologies and public goods that can enhance IBC, Cosmos SDK and more underlying technologies, which is crucial to Cosmos Hub, Cosmos chains and also the Interchain.

By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.\n\nThis upgrade does not include the Replicated Security feature; that will be part of the v9-Lambda upgrade.\n\nThe forum post discussing this upgrade can be found [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/upcoming-interchain-accounts-bugfix-release/8911/8).\n\n#### Background\nSince the last v7-Theta upgrade at height 9283650 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to Gaia.\n\n**Updates**\n- Bump [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to `v3.4.0` from `v3.0.0` which includes a fix for the interchain accounts vulnerability. See the full [Changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v3.4.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n- Bump [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to `v0.45.12` from `v0.45.9`. See the full [Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.12) and [Commit History](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/compare/v0.45.9...v0.45.12) for details and updates between the last version of the SDK used in Theta. \n- Bump [Tendermint](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to `v0.34.24` and replace with the [Informal Systems fork](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to ensure software continuity.\n- Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity) to `v1.5.3` which notably includes updating Go to `1.18` and the Cosmos-SDK to `v45.11` to ensure compatiblity with the Cosmos Hub.\n- Bump [Packet Forward Middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) to `v3.1.1`  from `v2.1.1`. Users should note that PFM was not configure properly in the previous version of Gaia. This module update includes necessary bug fixes to make it functional on the Cosmos Hub in v8.\n\n**Features**\n- Add the [Global Fee](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/main/x/globalfee) module to the Cosmos Hub, which enables setting transaction fees at the network level via `param-change` governance proposal. For more information, see the [module documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/modules/globalfee.md).\n- Add the `debug bech32-convert` [command](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/1845), enabling users to convert any bech32 string to the cosmos prefix. \n\n**Fixes**\n- Fix Bank Denom Metadata [issue](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/1892). In a previous upgrade, the `x/bank` metadata was incorrectly migrated, resulting in an incorrect bank metadata. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L19) for more information. \n- Fix Quicksilver ICA exploit detailed in the [forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/upcoming-interchain-accounts-bugfix-release/8911) on the incident. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L58) for more information.\n\n**Tests**\n- Add a [suite of E2E tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/release/v8.0.x/tests/e2e) to ensure core features of the Cosmos Hub work as expected.\n\n\n#### Testnet\nV8 Rho went live on the persistent testnet after the successful simulated upgrade. For more information, see the testnet [upgrade proposal](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/proposals/112) or [block explorer](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/), and visit the [persistent testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public).\n\n#### On-Chain Upgrade Process\n\nThis upgrade can be performed in multiple ways. When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically *before* swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\n\n#### Potential Risk Factors\n\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v7.1.0).",false],["Censure allnodes for insecure VaaS practices\n\n## Description\n\nFor context, please reference this report, produced by the Notional labs team with assistance from numerous community members:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1AIOOrHiNAFQKwzaeDNyJJJx8SwXNlaSUcZbasnezXS4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTo discuss, and to see a screenshot from today, of allnodes offering insecure VaaS services, please use this tweet:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gadikian/status/1622566060942819328?s=20\n\nTo discuss in the cosmos hub forum, please use this discussion:\n\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/censure-allnodes-for-insecure-vaas-practices/9519\n\n## Summary\nAllnodes is a validator on the cosmos hub, and offers insecure custodial VaaS on the Cosmos Hub, which is harmful to the economic and security interests of the cosmos community at large.

In return for this payment, Notional will monitor the Cosmos Hub for potential vulnerabilities on a 365/24/7 basis. When we become aware of an ongoing vulnerability, we will coordinate with relevant teams (SDK, IBC, Comet/Tendermint, Cosmos Hub), and work to produce a patch. We will then assist in rolling these patches out to validators to resolve the incident as soon as possible.\n\nWe will also advise core teams if we notice issues in upcoming releases which could cause safety or liveness problems, and assist them to resolve the issues.\n\nWe will write a monthly report on our activities so that the community has insight into them and can keep us accountable.

The feature being discussed here is in this family, but more accurately termed “Replicated Security”. In the past it has been referred to as Interchain Security v1, or ICS, but going forward we refer to it as Replicated Security.*\n\n## Summary\nThis on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt . By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.  \n\nThe Cosmos Hub is upgrading its security system with a new feature called Replicated Security. This will allow the Cosmos Hub to provide its strong security to other blockchains, which are called 'consumer chains'. The cost to censor or control a consumer chain with an economic attack is the same as the cost to censor or control the Cosmos Hub itself. This means that consumer chains can benefit from the Cosmos Hub's security without having to maintain their own validator sets.  \n\nReplicated Security works through the IBC protocol. Consumer chains receive periodic IBC packets containing the up-to-date validator set of the Cosmos Hub and use this to update their own validator sets, effectively replicating the Hub's validator set. This means that the Cosmos Hub's validators can validate multiple chains at once with the same stake.  \n\nIn exchange for this service, consumer chains are expected to send a portion of their fees and inflation to the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators. These tokens will then be included as part of the Cosmos Hub's staking rewards.\n\n## Software details\n### Updates\n* (feat) Add [Interchain-Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v1.0.0) provider module. See the [ICS Spec](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation/README.md) for more details.\n* (gaia) Bump [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.13-ics](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics) for details.\n* (gaia) Bump [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) to [v4.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/release/v4.2.x/CHANGELOG.md). See [v4.2 Release Notes](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for details.\n* (gaia) Bump [tendermint](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint) to [0.34.26](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/tree/v0.34.26). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/blob/v0.34.26/CHANGELOG.md#v03426) for details.\n* (gaia) Bump [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) to [v4.0.4](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v4.0.4).\n* (tests) Add [E2E ccv tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/tests/e2e/e2e_gov_test.go#L138). Tests covering new functionality introduced by the provider module to add and remove a consumer chain via governance proposal.\n* (tests) Add [integration ccv tests](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/tests/ics/interchain_security_test.go). Imports Interchain-Security's  and implements Gaia as the provider chain.\n\n### On-Chain Upgrade Process\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary.  \n\nAlternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local).\n\n### Potential Risk Factors\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.  \n\nCosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the #validators-verified channel of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v8.0.1).\n\n## Governance votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n* YES - You approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.\n* NO - You don’t approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub. Please indicate why on the Cosmos Hub forum.\n* NO WITH VETO - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n* ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\n## Appendix: Replicated Security\n### Changes to this proposal\nThis proposal went onto the governance forum in mid-December. Since that time, we have made one change to the protocol. In response to the only high-severity finding in the Informal audit report (see 'Testing and audits below'), and feedback from the community, we have made it so that the slashing and tombstoning of validators for offenses on consumer chains must be approved by a governance vote. This will have a [very minimal impact](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing) on the operation and security of consumer chains while protecting the Cosmos Hub from possibility of an attack by a rogue consumer chain.  \n\nThis governance gating is temporary until the Cosmos Hub is able to cryptographically verify proof of double signing in an upcoming release of Replicated Security. This does not give governance the ability to slash validators arbitrarily, but rather to approve slash packets that have already been transmitted from a consumer chain.\n\n### The ATOM economic zone\nIt is anticipated that consumer chains using Replicated Security will collaborate closely in an 'ATOM economic zone'. This is expected to have a snowball effect, with the Cosmos Hub securing a growing group of high-value decentralized protocols. Already, some prominent projects such as a smart-contracting platform, an AMM, several liquid staking providers and others have expressed interest in using Replicated Security from the Cosmos Hub.  \n\nReplicated Security can also be used to further the cause of “Hub minimalism”. Any new features to the Hub, even if they are core to the Hub's functionality, can be launched as consumer chains. This allows the Hub to scale better and separate release cycles, enabling faster deployment of new features.\n\n### Onboarding a consumer chain\nThis governance proposal will not launch any consumer chains on its own. Instead, it will only add the necessary code to the Cosmos Hub to enable Replicated Security. In order to launch, each consumer chain must submit their own governance proposal to be voted on separately.  \n\nIt is expected that before launch, a consumer chain will have participated in a Cosmos Hub Replicated Security testnet, conducted their own testnets, and undergone an audit by reputable auditors.  \n\nOnce a consumer chain proposal passes, Cosmos Hub validators can begin running the consumer chain and receiving rewards. The chain will only start if more than two-thirds (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators decide to run the consumer chain.\n\n### Offboarding a consumer chain\nOnce the consumer chain is running, validators can be slashed and jailed for consensus faults such as downtime and double signing on the consumer chain.  \n\nAt any point in time, one-third (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators will be able to stop running the consumer chain at once: the chain will halt, and none of them will be slashed for downtime.  \n\nThe offboardings of consumer chains will have strong social norms to protect both sides, and any kind of forceful exit will only be coordinated in extreme cases such as protocol failures or attacks.  \n\nFor normal cases, a separate governance proposal will be made to remove a consumer chain, which will allow Cosmos Hub validators to stop running it.\n\n### Further resources and information:\n#### Archival links\n* [IPFS pin of unabridged proposal text](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmY7h5BV725yifQavezbLVPM7nhG5UGpwk7pALEw8GNcU9)\n* [Forum discussion](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-v9-lambda-upgrade-with-replicated-security/8766)\n\n#### Essays and detailed feature explanations\n* [Preparing for Replicated Security](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/preparing-for-replicated-security/8925)\n* [Governance-Gated Slashing vs Automatic Equivocation Slashing](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing)\n\n#### Testing and audits\n* [Informal Systems Audit team results](https://informal.systems/replicated-security-audit.pdf)\n* [Findings from Game of Chains and Beyond](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/findings-from-game-of-chains-and-beyond/9720)\n* [ICS software tests](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/tree/main/tests)",false],["Interchain Info Funding\n\n# Overview\n\n[Original Cosmos Forum Post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-21-interchain-info-hub-funding/9822)\n[IPFS Version](https://sparkibc.s3.filebase.com/InterchainInfo/Hub%20Funding%20Prop%20for%20ICI.pdf)\n\nBuilt by Spark IBC, Interchain Info (ICI) is a truly multi-chain & chain-agnostic hub for information and tooling to make navigating the rapidly growing Interchain easier for both new and old users alike. At Spark IBC, we believe that, currently, “Cosmos” and the greater Interchain are extremely fragmented, as communities, educational resources, NFT collections, Dapps and tools each reside in their own remote corners of the ecosystem.\n\nICI aims to change this by taking the first step toward building the unified, multi-chain future that the community has been waiting for, and that we believe is paramount to Cosmos gaining mass adoption in the next market cycle. We are currently running an ICI funding campaign on the Spark IBC platform, found here, [https://sparkibc.zone](https://sparkibc.zone) 4 along with more details about ICI itself.\n\nWe are avoiding VCs and private investors in this endeavor, because ICI is only a valuable resource if it remains unbiased and beholden to no one but the community that uses it. Therefore, all ICI costs so far have come out of our own pockets, and going forwards, we're raising funds entirely through grants and donations from users and community pools.\n\n## Request\n\nWe request 1% of community pool funds, capped at $20,000 from a number of chains, including The Cosmos Hub, to contribute to The ICI Campaign on Spark IBC. For The Hub, this makes our total ask ~$20k or 1,438 ATOM at the time of writing.\n\nIf passed,\n\n- 50% of issued funds will be donated directly to ICI for general development, hosting and maintenance, to be used alongside other funding sources like private contributions done through the Spark platform.\n- The remaining 50% will be used as incentives for community members to create and submit content about general cosmos tech. For other chains, this 50% is reserved for content about stuff built in that chains ecosystem, but since the Hub is positioned a bit differently, we think it's match made in heaven to direct these funds towards content on things like IBC, CosmWasm, the Cosmos SDK, etc.\n- For The Hub, this amounts to ~20k USD in Atom total, which is about 1,438 ATOM, which will then be split 50/50 as outlined above.\n\nEach network that approves funding will be rewarded with Spark Points based on their full donation amount and a customized entry on our leaderboard labeled “[chain name] Community.” Spark Points are used within the Spark IBC system to recognize users for their contributions to the Interchain. In this case, there would be an entry made for “The Cosmos Hub Community” with 20k Spark Points.\n\nOne Spark Point is representative of one dollar (or USDC, or, in this case, token equivalent) donated, and is tracked through the soulbound $SPARK token on Juno Network. For these donations, Spark IBC will set up a wallet on Juno, or use the Bech32 converted version of the community pools address on Juno, label it accordingly on our leaderboard, and mint $SPARK equivalent to the USD value of the donated amount into it, measured by the price at the time of distribution. Slippage and fees for conversion will not be taken into account, as that's beyond the communities control.\n\nOne significant benefit of multi-chain projects is the unique ability to distribute our funding requests across different sources to minimize sell pressure and the burden on any single community pool/token. This sort of effort is something that Spark IBC plans to pioneer and offer as a potential service to any who use the Spark IBC platform for fundraising in future.\n\n\nSimilar funding requests will also be submitted to the following Cosmos chains:\n\n- Agoric\n- Akash\n- Band\n- Carbon\n- Cheqd\n- Chihuahua\n- Comdex\n- Cosmos Hub\n- Evmos\n- Fetch AI\n- Injective\n- Juno\n- Kava\n- Kujira\n- Osmosis\n- Persistence\n- Secret\n- Sommelier\n- Stargaze\n- Teritori\n- LUNC\n- Terra\n\n[Funding Ask Amounts Spreadsheet](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/e/edd7c2b885e321d82eefd114a7be03f232534462_2_629x500.png)\n\n## Spending Details\n\n### Base Contribution\n\nIn addition to the ICI info on SparkIBC.zone, we also have a rough breakdown of how funds will be spent given hitting certain funding tiers, found here 2\nLink: [ICI Budget Outline for Initial Raise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GYFnJYozptojj3ytE_OYbo03inoQ1dEJxnHnmparWQ/edit#gid=0)\n\n### Incentives Program\n\nAs stated, 50% of the requested $20k will be used exclusively to incentivize content related to general Cosmos tech & terminology on the Index and Resource hub. This allows community members and content creators the ability to earn a little income while contributing something beneficial to the entire interchain. It also ensures that a portion of the allotted funding amount returns to the community in a very direct way.\n\nNote: the Spark & ICI Team reserve the right to deny payment, both pre/post-production, to anyone on the basis of content quality or attempts to manipulate this proposed system (i.e. needlessly long articles, videos, copy others existing work as a full new submission etc.); this is not a “trustless” incentive program. At this time, we will only accept English submissions meeting basic literary standards; however, we may expand this program to include other languages in the future and/or add a translation tier to the list of incentives below (we are open to feedback on these details):\n\n[Submission outline](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/9/92c9a4e08b05afbc1cf46e0da69df8b0c827f1ee_2_450x500.png)\n\n*$0.05/word (written content) and $5.00/min. (video content) are below industry standards, but the crux of this project is to further incentivize creators who are already producing original content, while refining and updating existing material that needs to constantly be updated. In its entirety, this project will both promote new material and provide house-keeping for fresh, up-to-date information in order to attract new ecosystem investors and users.\n\n## Misc. Details\n\nHow will payment be distributed and handled?\n\n- We will be asking for the requested amount as a single lump sum payment. The amount granted will then be split into two chunks, each comprising 50% of the total.\n\t- 50% will be DCA'd out into stables over the following 15 days. Meaning a maximum daily sell pressure of no more than ~$666 per day for chains granting the full 20k, such as the Hub, and far less for others. This will be the base contribution.\n\t- The other 50% will be set aside for the content incentives program outlined above, and we will be gauging community sentiment on doing one of the three following options\n\t\t- Keep in the native currency\n\t\t- DCA out to stables along with the rest. Sell pressure will be kept to the above figure or less.\n\t\t- DCA out half (of the 50%, or 25% of the total) along with the base contribution.\n\nWill the incentives program be transparent?\n\t- Of course! We will keep records of payouts and the work done to receive them for the community to review. This also serves to provide a metric for results, and should help communities gauge whether a continuation of this program later down the road would be something of interest to them or not.\n\nHow long do you intend the incentive programs to last?\n\t- Due to the drastically different ask amounts amongst various chains, as well as the amount of content relevant to them, some chains' incentives may dry up much quicker than others. We believe that with the program we've outlined above, regardless of the duration, the general amount of work achieved per dollar spent should be similar.\n\nWhat happens if a chain does not pass the proposal, are they to be treated any differently?\n\t- Absolutely not. All chains and projects in the Cosmos are equal in our eyes, and no community will be penalized for failing to support our effort, except by missing out on the incentives program and, of course, contributing to something crucially important for the entire Interchain.\n\n\n\n## Voting Options\n\nYES: Agree to proceed with the funding for interchain info.\nNO: Disagree with the funding for interchain info.\nNO WITH VETO: Disagree with the funding for interchain info and want depositors penalized.\nABSTAIN: Decline to give an opinion on the funding.\n\n",false],["Proposal for issuance of fungible tokens directly on the Cosmos Hub\n\nThis proposal is a first step towards enabling fungible token issuance on the Cosmos Hub, with listing of new tokens requiring governance approval.

These corps lock the information, produced by the users, from search, social and commercial knowledge graphs in private databases, and then sell this knowledge back as advertisement. They stand as an insurmountable wall between content creators and consumers extracting an overwhelming majority of the created value.\n\nWe propose ATOM holders to invest 10,000 ATOM from the community pool into the Takeoff of Cyber. In exchange, at the end of its donation round (https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff), and when an IBC connection will become possible, cyber Congress will transfer CYB tokens back to the community pool.

It does so by opening up access to evergrowing semantics core taught to it by the users.\n\nEconomics of the protocol are built around the idea that feedback loops between the number of links and the value of the knowledge graph exist. The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.\n\nYou already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.\n\nWith the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.\n\nCosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.\n\nA good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn’t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn’t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (с) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).\n\nThe solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.\n\nThis means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer. So let us move the idea forward.\n\nIf this proposal is successful and stands for more demand from the public, we will open another proposal using the community pool. However, anyone can participate in Game of Links (https://cyber.page/gol/) or Takeoff https://cyber.page/gol/takeoff independently. If you have question you can ask them either on Cyber topic on Cosmos forum (https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cyber-a-decentralized-google-for-provable-and-relevant-answers) or Cyber forum (https://ai.cybercongress.ai).\n\nProposal results: https://www.mintscan.io/proposals/26",false],["ATOM 🤝 Osmosis:  Allocate Community Pool to ATOM Liquidity Incentives\n\nATOMs should be the base money of Cosmos, just like ETH is the base money of the entire Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. ATOM is currently well positioned to play this role among Cosmos assets because it has the highest market cap, most liquidity, largest brand, and many integrations with fiat onramps. ATOM is the gateway to Cosmos.\n\nIn the Cosmos Hub Port City vision, ATOMs are pitched as equity in the Cosmos Hub.  However, this alone is insufficient to establish ATOM as the base currency of the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Instead, the ATOM community must work to actively promote the use of ATOMs throughout the Cosmos ecosystem, rather than passively relying on the Hub's reputation to create ATOM's value.\n\nIn order to cement the role of ATOMs in Cosmos DeFi, the Cosmos Hub should leverage its community pool to help align incentives with other protocols within the Cosmos ecosystem. We propose beginning this initiative by using the community pool ATOMs to incentivize deep ATOM base pair liquidity pools on the Osmosis Network.\n\nOsmosis is the first IBC-enabled DeFi application. Within its 3 weeks of existence, it has already 100x’d the number of IBC transactions ever created, demonstrating the power of IBC and the ability of the Cosmos SDK to bootstrap DeFi protocols with $100M+ TVL in a short period of time. Since its announcement Osmosis has helped bring renewed attention and interest to Cosmos from the crypto community at large and kickstarted the era of Cosmos DeFi.\n\nOsmosis has already helped in establishing ATOM as the Schelling Point of the Cosmos ecosystem.  The genesis distribution of OSMO was primarily based on an airdrop to ATOM holders specifically, acknowledging the importance of ATOM to all future projects within the Cosmos. Furthermore, the Osmosis LP rewards currently incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs of the platform.\n\nOsmosis has the ability to incentivize AMM liquidity, a feature not available on any other IBC-enabled DEX. Osmosis already uses its own native OSMO liquidity rewards to incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs, leading to ~2.2 million ATOMs already providing liquidity on the platform.\n\nIn addition to these native OSMO LP Rewards, the platform also includes a feature called “external incentives” that allows anyone to permissionlessly add additional incentives in any token to the LPs of any AMM pools they wish. You can read more about this mechanism here: https://medium.com/osmosis/osmosis-liquidity-mining-101-2fa58d0e9d4d#f413 . Pools containing Cosmos assets such as AKT and XPRT are already planned to receive incentives from their respective community pools and/or foundations.\n\nWe propose the Cosmos Hub dedicate 100,000 ATOMs from its Community Pool to be allocated towards liquidity incentives on Osmosis over the next 3 months. This community fund proposal will transfer 100,000 ATOMs to a multisig group who will then allocate the ATOMs to bonded liquidity gauges on Osmosis on a biweekly basis, according to direction given by Cosmos Hub governance.  For simplicity, we propose setting the liquidity incentives to initially point to Osmosis Pool #1, the ATOM/OSMO pool, which is the pool with by far the highest TVL and Volume. Cosmos Hub governance can then use Text Proposals to further direct the multisig members to reallocate incentives to new pools.\n\nThe multisig will consist of a 2/3 key holder set consisting of the following individuals whom have all agreed to participate in this process shall this proposal pass:\n\n- Zaki Manian\n- Federico Kunze\n- Marko Baricevic\n\nThis is one small step for the Hub, but one giant leap for ATOM-aligned.\n",false],["Lowering Liquidity Pool Creation Fee\n\nAlthough the Gravity DEX launch on Cosmos Hub is technically successful, there exists several necessary ingredient to achieve significant user-base growth.\n\nIt includes of course, “farming incentives” for liquidity providers, but also the high pool creation fee disturbs quick adoption of pools with new tokens.

It was suggested when the Atom price is under $10, but now we have more reasons to make it significantly lower so that we can promote quicker new token introduction to the Gravity DEX.\n\nTherefore we suggest 5 Atoms for pool creation fee, which is equivalent to about $200.

The Cosmos Hub team at Interchain GmbH has done technical feasibility research by speaking with CosmWasm core contributors and validators to understand the burden of integration and believe it is technically feasible with resources in Interchain GmbH and Lido as well as regular advice meetings from Confio.\n\nThe instance of CosmWasm included on the Cosmos Hub will be governance gated and use Cosmos SDK v0.46.x. The governance feature set created by Confio, funded by [Prop 25](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/25), works so that all of the wasmd Message types can be executed by the chain’s governance module.

One alternative possibility that needs further review is whether to allow “one account” and designate it as the new governance module account to take advantage of the new features in the governance module coming in v8-Rho.\n\nCosmWasm on the hub comes with benefits and drawbacks that deserve serious attention.

With the creation of the Cosmos Stack (Tendermint, IBC, and SDK) and the development of key technologies for secure economic scaling (Interchain Security and Liquid Staking), the original vision of the Hub has been fulfilled. This document marks the transition to the next phase of the Cosmos Hub as an infrastructure service platform, and a renewed role for ATOM as preferred collateral within the Cosmos Network. It describes two pieces of app-specific functionality, the Interchain Scheduler and Interchain Allocator, which together form a flywheel for accelerating interchain growth. The Interchain Scheduler is a cross-chain block space marketplace, which generates revenues from cross-chain MEV. These revenues are used by the Interchain Allocator to capitalize new Cosmos chains, foster interchain collaboration, and thereby expand the total addressable market of the Scheduler. This paper also describes a new issuance regime optimized for Liquid Staking, where after a 36 month transition period, exponential issuance is reduced to a constant amount of ATOM issued per month. To administer the proposed plan, the paper describes the formation of Cosmos Councils, domain-specialized entities that carry out development and operations. Cosmos Councils together form the Cosmos Assembly, a body that is accountable to ATOM holders, responsible for setting yearly goals, resourcing, and administering work undertaken on behalf of Cosmos Hub.\\n\\nWe have included the paper below in its entirety for the community’s consideration.\\n\\n[The Cosmos Hub v1.2](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdC3YuZBUq5b9mEr3bKTDRq4XLcxafe3LHqDNFUgUoa61)\\n\\n\\n## Authors\\n- Sam Hart, Interchain GmbH\\n- Zaki Manian, Iqlusion\\n- Ethan Buchman, Informal Systems\\n- Max Einhorn, Iqlusion\\n- Jehan Tremback, Informal Systems\\n- Youssef Amrani, Cosmos Contributor\\n- David Feiock, Galileo\\n- Jack Zampolin, Strangelove\\n- Udit Vira, Hypha Worker Co-op\\n- Sacha Saint-Leger, Hypha Worker Co-op\\n- Kristi Poldsam, Iqlusion\\n- Jelena Djuric, Informal Systems\\n\\n\\n## Governance Votes\\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\\n- YES - You approve of and wish to ratify the contents of the proposed paper\\n- NO - You don’t approve of the contents of paper.

And a range of more specific, actionable insights on how to improve community health. We cant say what the specific insights are before doing the research, though.\n## About RnDAO\nWe're an R&D DAO with a mission to empower humane collaboration. Having already delivered research projects on sub-DAOs, DAO Conceptual Foundations, Decentralised Leadership, DAO Compensation and more: http:// rndao.mirror.xyz\n## Abstract\nLike many others, Cosmos depends on the health of its community and its vibez—yet understanding and measuring these factors (what we call Community Health) is challenging.\nToday, Web3 communities are left to rely on infrequent transactions data (on-chain records), while data from the significantly more frequent social interactions is limited to basic indicators of Discord or Discourse, Web2-oriented bots like Statsbot that give simplistic measurements, or a patchwork of “homemade” surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are ill-suited for DAO communities, surveys are time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results of these approaches, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.\nPerhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders and members without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market crashes, protocol migrations, etc.).\n## Specification\nFor the conceptual framework, we have assembled a team including two PhDs in network science and an organisation designer with significant DAO and community building experience to bridge both theory and practice. We've reviewed over 50 papers on the topics of Community, Social Network Analysis, Resilience, Trust, Engagement, and more. And are synthesising all of these findings to define the key indicators that have high validity and high predictive capacity for community health, while also taking a holistic perspective that accounts for member's wellbeing and planning to collect data across communities to offer an ecosystem health scrore too.\nFor the data collection tool, we're going beyond traditional surveys.\nThis research proposal focuses on the use of two critical techniques as a starting point:\nOrganizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how communications, information, and value creation occur through an organization based on interaction graphs. ONA has been shown to provide a wide range of insights to improve contributor retention, avoid member burnout, predict team performance and community resilience, identify key contributors, enable decentralization, and improve coordination. Although relatively new, ONA is gaining in popularity over traditional survey tools.\nPulse Surveys are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide qualitative and quantitative insights. In traditional organizations, they have been shown to increase employee response rate and employee engagement with related initiatives. They're also used as a tool for culture design and implementing culture change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys significantly reduce admin work for community managers and related roles. Importantly, these surveys offer an opt-out option from future prompts and are also framed to leverage coaching techniques to offer a prompt for reflection, thus offering value to participants as a recentering exercise on the value of community.\nThe data is anonymised and collected in a central repository for this first phase (we're exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a team having received ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should it be misused.\n## Rationale\nThe techniques used (ONA based on communication and Pulse Surveys) provide maximum insights on Community Health compared with exclusively on-chain data analysis. And provide minimum disruption for community members and minimal admin compared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially, the techniques selected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation by those less likely to respond to long surveys e.g. those less engaged and thus likely with the most valuable feedback to give.\nAlthough our initial focus is Community Health metrics, the proposed approach sets the foundation for further applications. Some of the potential applications and insights for Cosmos Hub and Cosmos-Chains-based DAOs are:\n* Generate baseline metrics for Community Health / vibez to quantify and better understand the impact that a specific event is having on a community and/or sub-groups within the community\n* Predict which contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive action (without breaching privacy\n* Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for improvement\n* Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or Insights metrics\n* Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment, community experience, etc. in near real-time\n* Attract talent and investment with objective Community Health metrics instead of proxy metrics like member count or proposal count, or financial metrics such as TVL\nIn addition to the initial research on Community Health, the potential applications mentioned above can enable more effective and targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities.\n## Why our Team\nTeam Leads\nKaterinabc\nPh.D. in Team Dynamics using Social Network Analysis, Teaching Collaboration, and Organizational Performance at Northwestern University (since 2016).\nCo-organized Learning in Networks sessions at the International Conference of Social Network Analysis (2018 - 2020), and previously advised a people analytics company on social network metrics.\nThegadget.eth\nSoftware Engineer.

This large pool of capital is used for ecosystem growth through grants, development, and community building.\n\nThis new tax signals that the community is not content with the growth of the Hub, specifically for maintenance, development, grants, and funding.\n\nWith the signaling proposal of the V9 Lambda launch, Interchain Security (ICS), consumer chains, and Replicated Security are quickly becoming reality. A new narrative is emerging for the Cosmos Hub, a sustainable stream of real yield to $ATOM stakers. The Cosmos Hub has seen the emergence of 54 appchains. \n\nThe consumer chain narrative is new, untested, and relatively unknown to teams outside the Cosmos ecosystem. We will take on this challenge and change this.\n\nOur 3 objectives:\n\n1) Make over 1,000 developer teams Cosmos-aware. Create a developer and project awareness campaign around Replicated Security, IBC, and the consumer chain narrative.\n\n2) Support Replicated Security. AlphaGrowth will find, educate, recruit, and deploy grants to 20 or more DeFi projects that will launch on consumer chains. We will help find, educate, and recruit 1–2 consumer chain candidates.\n\n3) Map infrastructure and utility for consumer chains and map, foster, and communicate increases in ATOM utility.\n\n## Details\n\nFor more than 18 months, AlphaGrowth has helped acquire developers and dApps on behalf of ecosystems. In 2022, we helped source thousands of conversations and 40+ dApps deployed on Aurora EVM. In late 2022, we began working with Kava EVM to drive adoption of the DeFi narrative. Within two months, we helped drive 14 new dApps to Kava and continue to drive 10–15 dApps each month.

Though the full implications are unclear, there is likely irreversible damage to Terra's user and developer base.\n\nThe Juno Network consists of a strong community of passionate users and developers, and like Terra shares the mindset that the true value of a network lies in the protocols and applications built upon it. This proposal is an endeavor to enable Terra developers to continue building and innovating. Furthermore, this aims to be a lifeline for their existing users to continue to benefit from these developers’ platforms.\n\nSeveral Terra projects have reached out and expressed interest in migrating to and developing on Juno Network. It is expected that many more innovative projects and teams will follow with the passing of this proposal. \n\n## Background\n\nOn May 9th, 2022 the Terra chain appears to have suffered a financial attack that resulted in the insolvency of the network, and a crash in both UST and LUNA. \n\nThe combined market cap of LUNA/UST prior to the attack was in excess of 39.1 billion dollars. There are many hugely successful CosmWasm applications on Terra. These applications and protocols will need a home going forward. \n\nJuno, as a firmly established CosmWasm chain, can provide a platform and considerable community support for these developers to continue building their projects - a new home. \n\nThis will also benefit Juno by bringing in a wave of new users, developers and applications.\n\n## Proposed Use of Funds\n\nThe Community Fund contains roughly 16,248,583 JUNO, or approximately $75,880,883 in USD equivalent / €72,845,647 in EUR equivalent at the time of writing.\n\nThis proposal would allocate a total of 1,000,000 JUNO (700,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool & 300,000 JUNO from the Juno Development Fund) to a Terra Developer Fund Multi-sig for project migration and continued development in the Juno ecosystem. It is worth approximately $4,670,000 in USD equivalent / €4,483,647 EUR equivalent at the time of writing.\n\nVia governance, the funding could be further expanded with additional disbursements, if development accelerates, or returned back to the respective community and developer fund pools from the Multi-sig, if development wanes.

Currently the floor to become an active validator is quite high, at nearly 47,700 JUNO or approximately $168,000 USD.\n\nAs of right now, there is currently a number of validators sitting just outside the active set who have also been active historically, with many more waiting for a set expansion to join in consensus. A more diverse set of validators brings new ideas into the space, new viewpoints in governance and often leads to new innovation and development for the chain.\n\nAs with all set expansions, it is possible that expanding the set could have a small effect on the overall block times taking longer, as more validators will be required to achieve consensus. After reviewing analysis of previous set expansions, these effects appear negligible upon block times during that period, but it is important to communicate clearly both the pros and cons of any parameter change to the network.\n\n## Decentralization of Stake\n\nSet expansions are not a perfect science, and in reviewing that same analysis provided by some other talented validators, we have seen that historically these expansions don't always lead to further decentralization of stake on their own. \n\nWe hope that delegators will take the opportunity of this set expansion to **rebalance their stake** from the top of the active set to competent validators lower on the list.\n\nBalancing your stake **outside the top 10 to 20 validators** on the network is the best way to assist in this initiative, as we work together as a community to improve the voting power balance on Juno even further.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWe also strongly encourage new validators entering the set to avoid behavior such as **NFT giveaways**, **validator specific snapshots** or **commission refunds/rebates** which circumvent the 5 percent minimum commissions as established by [Juno Network Prop 3](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/3).\n\nEqually we recommend that delegators and investors avoid participating in these activities if they see them, and instead find strong validators which respect and follow the parameters of the network as they were established through the governance, by the community.

Since the passing of the Terra Developer Fund Proposal, 18 projects have pulled themselves from the wreckage of the Terra collapse and found a new home on Juno. In this process of delivering aid to Terra projects, we noticed that Terra developers aren't the only ones who could use a little help. There are many new projects building on Juno, or who wish to build on Juno, that could benefit from community support.\\n\\nThe rapid ascent of projects on Juno has been fantastic, but in an increasingly competitive landscape, we must maintain this momentum and drive growth sustainably for the long term. We can now do this with the Growth Fund, one led by community members, operated transparently, and owned by Juno governance. We now have the time and opportunity to build up the ideal form of this DAO. We must have more human resources, diverse views, and representatives from the community - as well as a means to collaborate with outside capital partners to participate alongside the Juno Community in funding these protocols. The projects built in this bear market will define Juno's future as a leader in the Cosmos, a home for projects and protocols, and a community-driven incubator for the CosmWasm interchain.\\n\\nThis proposal would transition the Terra Developer Fund into an official Grow Juno SubDAO. This proposal aims to expand the membership to include members from the community with professional investing experience, analyst skill sets and valuable business acumen. As a community initiative, we are purposefully aiming to have less representation from Core-1, and stronger representation from experts within the community.\\n\\nThis proposal will expand upon Proposal 23 by extending the scope beyond Terra migrations to include all new projects and investments conducive to the growth and development of Juno, to bring more value to Juno holders as a whole, as well as new investment opportunities which expand the Juno's Community Pool and make it a sustainable resource for continued growth and community endeavors. \\n\\nThe [Terra Developer Fund Treasury](https://legacy.daodao.zone/multisig/juno1lgnstas4ruflg0eta394y8epq67s4rzhg5anssz3rc5zwvjmmvcql6qps2) will be transferred to the Grow Juno SubDAO and will seed the initial SubDAO treasury.\\n\\n## Creation of SubDAO\\n\\nIf passed, an official SubDAO will be created so that the Juno community maintains control of the SubDAO itself, and its associated treasury.\\n\\nAt the time of Prop 23 passing, the DAODAO SubDAO system was not available. Now that it is available, it is a much better setup than a normal multisig and with DAODAO V2 on the way, this will only make SubDAOs more effective.\\n\\n**Some key benefits are:**\\n\\n- Community control of SubDAO membership.\\n- Community control of SubDAO treasury.\\n- Formalization of the purpose of this SubDAO: To grow the overall ecosystem and bring in new capital.\\n- Control from the community to return funds to the Community Pool, if it deems necessary.\\n- Control from the community to add or remove members and the entire SubDAO, if it deems necessary.\\n\\n**Specific mandates:**\\n\\n1) The Grow Juno SubDAO will seek community approval (through on-chain signaling proposal) for any grants above k to any single entity.\\n\\n2) The Grow Juno SubDAO will actively seek out projects and investments which can contribute strong token swaps and/or obvious profits to the Community Pool, and will always aim to take actions which maintain the sustainability of the fund for the Juno community. In some cases, public goods may be funded, subject to the same limitations as above, insofar as they unlock key functionality for promising new protocols, (i.e. oracles, infrastructure partners, indexing, protocol code audits, etc)\\n\\n3) The Grow Juno SubDAO Treasury is subject to the control of the entire community. The community has the ability to cancel any outstanding funding and/or return funds to the community pool, at any time through governance, for any reason.\\n\\n4) The Grow Juno SubDAO membership will be established by governance, and will be maintained and changed using DAO voting, as necessary to accommodate and adjust its membership to the needs of the Juno Community. At any time, on-chain governance can override membership, as with all SubDAOs.\\n\\n5) As the membership is expanding, it's important to mandate that, where notable conflicts of interest may occur, members are expected to vote to abstain and recuse themselves. Simply being an investor in a project shall not be deemed to be a conflict of interest.\\n\\n6) The Grow Juno SubDAO will encourage and assist protocols in seeking additional supplementary funding with outside capital and funding partners to lower the risk of funding issuance by the Juno community, and will help to bring in new capital to the ecosystem through venture partners.\\n\\n7) Being an investor in projects is encouraged, and many of the venture investors working alongside the DAO can and should take on the risk of investing in protocols coming into the ecosystem. This must be encouraged to spread risk/benefit amongst numerous entities, and not place the burden of protocol funding solely upon the Juno community. Investments shall be disclosed by members publicly.\\n\\n8) Members of the DAO should be paid modestly while proving their own continued effectiveness and the viability of the subDAO, but well enough to put in the hours required to achieve the goals of the subDAO. This will be implemented sustainably by staking a portion of the treasury so that funding is not depleted over time.\\n\\n9) These mandates can be changed only through SubDAO membership voting on DAODAO, in a manner fully visible to the Juno community.\\n\\n**The membership of this SubDAO is proposed to be as such:**\\n\\n6 of 11 required for funding approval\\n\\n- Kevin Garrison (Oni Validator + Juno Biz Dev)\\n- Maxjuno (Community Outreach + DAO Coordination)\\n- Pupmos (Technical Expertise, Validator)\\n- GoldenRatioStaking (Contracts Negotiations, Real Estate Investor)\\n- Rarma (Project Manager, Quality Assurance, Vetting)\\n- Jonathan DeLine (Venture Experience, M&A, Advisor)\\n- Wtrsld (NetaDAO + Venture Experience)\\n- Avicenna - Kleomedes (Validator, Fund Experience, Yield Expert, Analytics)\\n- BoringDAO Members (Cosmos Investment DAO: Rahul P., Jonathan K., Connor K., RJ Patel)\\n- Jonathan Caras, (VC, Protocol Outreach, Project Specialist, Comms)\\n- Matthew Cantieri (VC, Microsoft VC, Protocol Incubation)\\n\\n**Advisory Board to the subDAO:**\\nThese are advisors to the subDAO, who have valuable insights and skills and will also serve as a pool of potential DAO members who can step in to take up a voting seat, when needed.\\n\\n- _BitN8 (Project Specialist, Vetting)_\\n- _JaparJam (Web3 Builders Alliance, Developer Resources)_\\n- _CamelJuno (Full Stack Dev, UI/UX/DX, C2 Contributor)_\\n- _Soi2studios (Community + Investor)_\\n- _Reece, Validator & Technical Expert - NotionalDAO_\\n- _TendermintTimmy, (SparkIBC, Community Validator)_\\n- _Joe Abbey (Community Validator, Technical Expert)_\\n- _Highlander Nodes (Validator, C2 Contributor)_\\n- _Gjermund Garaba (EmpowerChain, Dev, Validator)_\\n- _CommunityStaking (Community Validator)_\\n- _DelRey - Stakin (Community Validator)_\\n\\n### Verifying the SubDAO Instantiation Message\\nInformation on verifying and understanding the SubDAO Instantiation message and how it works can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/JakeHartnell/95492da2508074e44b8e5cef01aebc5f).\\n\\n## Vote:\\n\\nBy voting **YES**, you agree the Grow Juno SubDAO should be created as per the above proposal.\\n\\nBy Voting **NO**, it means you do not believe the Grow Juno SubDAO should be created as per the above proposal.\\n\\nBy voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\\n\\nVoting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.\\n",false],["Launch Delegations SubDAO\n\nJuno **Delegation SubDAO** will be in charge of delegations for the Core Developer Fund, including all required collation of information, scoring of validator contributions, delegating tokens to validators on behalf of the Developer Fund wallet, and maintaining and updating the delegation criteria.\\n\\nThe SubDAO will be granted delegation rights through the AuthZ module and will execute delegations through a DAODAO multisig.\\n\\nThe SubDAO will collate all available information and score contributions every quarter.\\n\\nMembers:\\n\\n-   [Rarma_ (Community Member)](https://twitter.com/Rarma_)\\n-   [MaxJuno (Wombat / Juno Core Contributer)](https://twitter.com/max_maxsolo)\\n-   [Thyborg (Community Member)](https://twitter.com/Thyborg_)\\n-   [Joshua Tan (Metagov)](https://twitter.com/joshuaztan)\\n-   [Nullmames (Kingnodes / Juno Core Contributor)](https://twitter.com/nullMames)\\n-   [Dimi (Core Root)](https://twitter.com/dimiandre)\\n-   [Jake (Core Root / DAODAO)](https://twitter.com/JakeHartnell)\\n-   [Daniel Hwang (Community Member / Governance Specialist)](https://twitter.com/danhwang88)\\n-   [Community Staking (CommunityStaking Validator)](https://twitter.com/CommunityStakin)\\n\\nMembers of the community can apply to be part of the SubDao anytime in our forum.

Such methods included offering grants, Hack Juno rewards, or community-pool based funding approved via governance.\\nBut what if the chain offered built-in incentives for development on Junø? Will it attract further development and contributors to begin landing on Junø?\\n## Contributor Fee-Based Incentives\\nThe proposed solution is constructed around rewarding developers based on the overall user interest in what has been developed, which is potentially a longterm continuous reward.\\nFor each smart contract, there will be a fee recipient address which is defaulted to the creator address.\\nThe fee split parameter would be configurable via governance. As of now, we propose a 50/50% split.\\nFor each transaction which executes the smart contract, 50% of the transaction fee is distributed to the fee recipient address. The remaining 50% is distributed to stakers.\\nThis mechanism allows developers to be fairly rewarded as long as their development is raising activity and users are transacting with their smart contract. Fee distribution will not require voting or permission, and acts as longterm potential revenue, which can attract more developers to build on Junø.\\n## How Contributor Incentives can commend DAOs\\nOne of the optimistic outcomes will be the integration between DAO treasuries and on-chain smart contracts, where the treasury address can be the contract’s fee recipient address to receive fee-based incentives.\\nFor example, JunoSwap can set the RAW DAO treasury as the contributor address, where 50% of the fees collected by JunoSwap transactions will be automatically received by the RAW DAO.\\n## Postscript\\nThis is a signaling proposal to evaluate the community’s interest in the proposed “Contributor Fee-Based Incentives” mechanism.

Many major DeFi protocols depend upon decentralized price feeds to function correctly. This is a rapid solution to provide that functionality.\\n- Currently, projects on Juno wanting to access price feeds have to pay excessive fees to access these feeds, which can be prohibitive for a start-up.\\n- Implementing a Price Oracle on Juno natively would give Juno (and the community) control over this public good.\\n- Even if better solutions come along, this is a rapidly implementable stop-gap solution that can be deployed. Future oracles and providers may improve upon this service.\\n- Juno would be the first *permissionless* CosmWasm chain with an on-chain Price Oracle, which is a valid differentiator for builders seeking to deploy DeFi protocols in a permissionless environment.\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n- Validators will have to run additional software to ensure the price oracle is decentralized. Failure to do so will result in soft-slashing, so Juno stakers and validators face a non-zero risk of soft-slashing. Soft-slashing is set at 0.01% on Juno. *(The slashing window is an adjustable parameter and will be set conservatively at first to allow validators to gain software familiarity.)*\\n- Some blockchains have already added price oracles, though none are permissionless. This is a solution that exists on chains such as Kujira and Umee.\\n- Oracle TX fees have to be paid from a common pool, and ultimately there is a cost to the community for those tokens.\\n\\n## Voting\\n\\n- Vote **YES** if you\\'d like Juno to implement this Price Oracle solution as per the above.\\n- Vote **NO** if you don\\'t want Juno to implement this Price Oracle solution as per above.\\n- By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote for or against the proposal.\\n- Voting **NOWITHVETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",false],["Fund only open source software\n\nJuno Core One SubDAO, community pool, treasury, and every funding body affiliated with Juno funds, must not disburse any funds to any close source projects.\n\nFunded projects should open source every component of their application, if they wish to continue to receive funding.\n\nThis is the only way to verify security of the network to protect interests of investors.

Memes are a form of online communication that can be a fun and effective way to share ideas and culture. They often use humor and creativity to make complex ideas more accessible, and can help bring people together around a common interest or topic. Additionally, memes can be a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing people to express their opinions and engage in political and cultural discussions in a way that is relatable and engaging. Overall, memes can be a positive force in culture by promoting communication and collaboration, as well as providing a platform for artistic expression and social commentary.\\n\\n### Members\\n\\nRekt Zerker: Professional memer and shitposter\\nRektVee: Professional memer and FUDmaster\\nGiannisMartakos: Professional memer, community manager and GIF artist\\nKingJulianIam: DeFi content creator and analyst\\nrekt_news: Who knows who they are\\nBbands: Twitter Spaces extraordinaire\\nCosmos Junky: He has Cosmos in his name, must be legit\\nHodl Juno: He hodls Juno, definitely qualified\\nTenderMint Timmy: Leader of Joes\\nRobo Racoon: Can you imagine the smell?\\nEmir: Good vibes person\\nFarmer Stars: Makes gud memes\\n\\n### Why\\n\\nThe special sauce that brings Juno together.

We have three main topics that we will consider as Hackathon content; DeFi, GameFi, and SocialFi.\n\nGoal:\n\nAs the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem, our primary purpose in wanting to realize the \"HackJuno Turkey Hackathon\" event is to introduce the Cosmos network, especially the Juno Ecosystem, to the Turkish Blockchain ecosystem and market because many projects that we can develop with the Cosmos and Juno ecosystem will bring us to the forefront in the international and national sense, especially the Blockchain and Web3 communities in Turkey.\n\nSocial Responsibility:\n\nOur aim on this path, which we set out with the motto of awareness, is to create and shape the motivation of potential web3 developers while organizing a hackathon. The \"Turkey Inter-University E-sports Tournament,\" which is among the events we will collect in parallel with the \"HackJuno Turkey\" hackathon, also carries a social responsibility purpose with the training we will give to the tournament participants at the workshops. Bringing potential talent and creators from Blockchain, Web3, and GameFi into the ecosystem is one of our main objectives at this event.\n\nWhy are we different from other Hackathons?\n\nThe main thing that will make HackJuno Turkey different from other Hackathons is education and awareness.

The Juno Community pool and the WYND DAO will each own 50% of provided liquidity. This is not a spend, but rather a reallocation of unutilized $JUNO into a defi protocol.\n1. The liquidity may be removed at a future date, and the value of the liquidity at the time of removal will be returned to the Juno Community pool and the WYND DAO at 50/50 distribution. Specifically, at the time of removal from the liquidity pool, all available $JUNO will be sent to the Juno Community Pool and all available $WYND will be sent to the WYND DAO.\n1. None of the liquidity will be bondend so it will not impact incentives for regular liquidity providers. If community want to bond these tokens they should open a new governance proposal specific for this.\n1. In case the community decides to bond tokens in the future, the incentives earned will be split 50% to Juno Community pool and 50% to WYND DAO.\n1. $WYND incentives earned by Juno Community pool will be sent to the Juno Community pool. The Juno Community pool has the full right to determine how these assets are used, including but not limited to selling/swapping, staking for governance rights, providing liquidity, or to use in other defi applications. \n1. Participation in Protocol Owned Liquidity can be withdrawn at any time for any reason by either party.\n1. Modification of existing parameters, such as adding, partially removing liquidity, or adding / modifying the bondend amount or duration will also require an on-chain governance vote by both parties.\n\n\n## Plan of action\n\nCommunity pool tokens from Juno and WYND DAO will be  sent to a Juno/WYND PoL multi-sig address that will then allocate token to the liquidity pools. This subDAO will also maintain custody of the LP position unless a governance proposal from either Juno or WYND dictates otherwise.\n\nAny excess $WYND goes to the WYND DAO community pool. This means in effect that each side contributes a maximum number of tokens as given in the proposal, but the swap is performed at market price at time of LPing, so the token with better price action will receive some of the tokens back\n\n\nMultisig members are\n- Esse (Made in Block Validator)\n- Jakub (WYND Developer)\n- Rarma (Community Member)\n- CryptoCakir (Stake & Relax Validator)\n- Mike Purvis (CronCat co-founder)\n\n\nMultisig can be viewed here: https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1nmua4tj8kxvfmzexx8vuggv2zzq24hf8t7grvjjvc2xjll3vjwyqf4eshn\n\n## Note\n\n_Protocol Owned Liquidity_ is a novel concept that has yet to be successfully implemented in the Cosmos Ecosystem.

This makes it possible to transfer ETH or any ERC20 token from Peggy to JunoSwap, enabling such pairs as JUNO:ETH and JUNO:RNDR. \n\nIn the very near future, Sifchain will soon upgrade peggy to Omni-EVM, which will enable quick deployment of EVM bridges, and enable token pairs on JunoSwap such as JUNO:NEAR and JUNO:SOL.\n\nBenefits:\nEnabling assets from different, secure bridges, ensures that users of JunoSwap will not be limited by the token-selection of only one bridge. This is relevant because many innovative bridge solutions will launch in Cosmos, and being limited to only one bridge will reduce the amount of assets that can be swapped on JunoSwap – thus sending users elsewhere to make swaps.  \n\nWhile it has been argued by other DEXes that this makes UX unpleasant, there are many work arounds to this. For example, truly permissionless listings for all assets have not stopped UniSwap from achieving over $10B in TVL. Improvements to UX are as simple as implementing a manage-tokens toggle (appended below).    \n\nIf this Proposal Passes:\nThe community supports the permissionless listing of assets that come from Sifchain’s Peggy bridge. \n\nAdditional Information  :\nIn order to ensure that conflicts-of-interest do not play a role in the outcomes of this proposal, we would encourage any validators that have a vested interest in the success of another bridge and choose to vote to:  \n\na) state their biases\n b) abstain\n\nAppendix:\nSifchain Audits:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1kkjdpNuRmTjaiIKA6CQISavCvj4Awpbc\n\nUniswap UX Flow: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JrjhvAVZwa5jxNeBvOKIfSIY2i1sJyf1yaN-s5yUJ64/edit?usp=sharing",false],["Harmony Proposal to end FUD\n\nThis is a signaling proposal offering a compromise to the problems presented in [Prop 4](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/4) and [Prop 16](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/16).\n\nCCN clients have agreed in advance by majority to support this compromise.\n\nBy voting YES, the Juno stakers voice their support\n\n- To split All JUNO including staking rewards in [the address](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1aeh8gqu9wr4u8ev6edlgfq03rcy6v5twfn0ja8) equally between the \"Community\" (50%) and \"CCN Clients\" (50%)\n\nThe funds will be allocated as follows:\n- The \"Community Portion\" of JUNO allocated to a smart contract governed by the community.

By utilizing the speed, security, and decentralization of the Juno blockchain, AmigoSound could demonstrate the potential of the platform in the music industry and potentially attract more artists and fans to the Juno ecosystem. \n \n AmigoSound’s decision to build its platform on the JUNO network will benefit the broader Juno community in a number of ways. \n \n Additionally, the use of JUNO on the AmigoSound platform will increase the overall adoption and use of the network, which can help to increase the value of the JUNO token. \n \n The allocation of 10% of the total $AMIGO token supply to JUNO stakers through an airdrop is also going to benefit the Juno community by providing additional value to its members and incentivizing them to hold and use JUNO. \n \n ### Grant Details and Timeline \n \n  [Grant amount link](https://amigosound.gitbook.io/proposal-for-amigosound-project/funding-proposal/grant-amount) \n \n AmigoSound is asking for a total of 50.000 JUNO (at the last month's price of 2$) from the Juno community to support development costs for our music ecosystem project. \n \n The requested amount we are asking represents 0.3% of the total Juno Community Pool. \n \n This is to be released gradually, based on project development and milestone progress. \n \n The milestone system enables a social contract between us and the Juno community.

Proposal #2 for initiation of liquidity mining incentives for bonded liquidity providers passed on 2021-06-23 16:52 UTC. Prior to Proposal #2 passing, the Osmosis Team issued the following message: \"Note that users can begin bonding their LP tokens even though liquidity incentives haven’t been enabled yet, and their first LP reward will be distributed at 2021-06-23 17:00 UTC.\"\nDiscord link: https://discord.com/channels/798583171548840026/842477665860583434/856777198442774569\nSkylink: https://skygallery.hns.skyportal.xyz/#/a/AABDv3g-2RYw1FbuF8BDn2yKyjS_5jMOrSVkS-KdWTQfoQ\n\nBased upon that and other messages, the community (including the Osmosis Team) believed that ELPs would receive their portion of the newly initiated liquidity mining rewards at the close of that epoch. ELPs assumed significant risk by providing liquidity and bonding their tokens at a time when overall liquidity on Osmosis was a small fraction of what it is today. Unfortunately, ELPs received no rewards for their service. The Osmosis Team acknowledges this miscommunication and recommended that the community submit a governance proposal to distribute the rewards from the community pool to ELPs. ELPs experienced substantial impermanent loss, price slippage, and lost opportunity cost of capital. ELPs rightfully expected liquidity rewards for these risks by providing the earliest and most important liquidity on the platform, especially considering the miscommunication from the Osmosis Team. Instead, ELPs performed worse than those who retained liquid capital and bonded later when there was less risk, less slippage and more volume (at the expense of ELPs). This result is inequitable and contrary to the ethos of Osmosis.\n\nShould this proposal pass, the liquidity rewards will be distributed to applicable recipients from the community pool after a future software upgrade performed by the Osmosis Team. We thank you for your consideration.\n\nNote:\nThis proposal is a revision of proposal #11, which proposed to distribute 20% of the rewards to current LPs. Following discussions with community members (particularly on Discord), a strong opinion was that a 20% concession would set a bad precedent. The issue is that, regardless of what the intention is, rewarding other LPs in this context is essentially vote buying.

The exact percentage depends on details of how many validators were counted as online at the epoch block. This is an unfair system for a number of reasons, and introduces a force to centralize stake amongst the validators who already have the most stake. This is because:\\n\\n1. (In theory) The chance of a validator being the proposer is proportional to their stake, which means you have the same expected return, but lower variance with larger validators. This gives an incentive to delegate to the largest validators. (There is a similar effect in POW mining systems like Bitcoin, which leads to pools)\\n2. In practice, the chance of a validator being the epoch proposer is 0 if they are not in the top 66% (by stake) of fastest validators. Only the validators who finish computing the block first will be potential proposers for it. This also contributes to centralization, as the largest validators can most afford to maximize their speed.\\n3. The proposer selection algorithm is not based on secure randomness, it isn’t even random at all. It is in fact highly manipulable. There are known strategies validator operators could use to attempt to propose a specific block. Actual usage of these strategies could be considered byzantine behavior, and could lead to further network instability around the epoch time.\\n\\nThis centralization effect is harmful to the long term success of the network – we want the stake distribution to become much less top heavy. Stake distribution has been decentralizing nicely as time has gone in the network, but it would be ideal to further accelerate this decentralization. And whats critical to that, is at minimum, lowering the incentive for the stake to centralize at the top. We are nowhere near the end state yet for stake distribution!\\n\\n--Short Term Suggestion--\\n\\nCreate a parameter change proposal to set the proposer bonus to 0%. This would then go into affect immediately after the proposal passes.\\n\\n--Long Term Suggestion--\\n\\nThis is definitely a conversation that needs to be designed together over time!\\nTalking with @UnityChaos & @dogemos, we thought it’d be cool to re-introduce this proposer bonus lottery, but have it only be applicable to the bottom {say} 50 validators. Also have the total pot of the reward not be 5%, but instead be around {say} 1% of the reward. This would help incentivize decentralization of the network, and also retain the (accidentally introduced) lottery effect that so many folks like! (Since delegating to smaller validators would be higher EV!)\\n\\nIt is possible that higher stake validators sybil themselves into multiple lower stake validators. The hope is that the pot here is sufficiently low, that this won’t be worth the reputational hit that the sybilling validator would take. (And would also cause community uproar, justifying a governance proposal to slash them) There is still a fear that the big validator makes multiple sybils anonymously, this is quite plausible if its all their own funds. Noticeability only really comes in when its from validators gathering delegations from users, or are trying to build a common brand.\\n\\nThe blocker for re-introducing this epoch reward lottery this is we need a secure on-chain randomness source. (In addition to design work to ensure sybilling incentivizes are sufficiently low) This can be added as a follow-on to the threshold decryption work that is being worked on. The threshold decryption work eliminates most of the known forms of MEV learned about from Ethereum, such as front-running, sandwitching, stealing arbs, etc. – making them unable to applied on Osmosis once its done. It turns out that the technical primitive underlying this is very well suited for making a secure on-chain randomness source.",false],["Clawback ALL unclaimed ION & OSMO to Community Pool after airdrop decay period?\n\nThe passing of Prop #29 generated plenty of further community discussion on how to go about enacting a clawback and how to utilize it.

Reclaiming the idle stagnating OSMO's to support the future betterment of the Osmosis Zone seems a logical extension of the consensus to clawback unclaimed Ions.

Due to unprecedented demand, we are going to expand the conference for an additional day, turning it into a two-day conference from November 5-6.\n\nObjective\nCosmoverse is held to raise awareness of Cosmos and its vibrant ecosystem. Hundreds of Cosmonauts from all over the world will unite to learn and network at Cosmoverse.\nThe team:\n\nCosmoverse is organized by Cosmonauts, for Cosmonauts.\n\nDuring late October and early November, Lisbon is going to be full with Crypto-specific events and conferences.\n\nCosmoverse takes place in between ETH Lisbon and Solana, which means that attendees from these events will have the opportunity to join us, too.\n\nLivestream\nFor those that are unable to attend, there will be a livestream broadcasting of the event, in collaboration with OmniFlix. A professional camera setup and videographers are already arranged. We will create specific in-stream content in advance to provide a seamless experience for online-viewers.\nEvent Highlights\nCosmoverse is organized by the community, for the community. We managed to onboard reputable speakers from the Cosmos ecosystem, such as Sunny Aggarwal, Billy Rennekamp, Alessio Treglia, Federico Kunze-Küllmer, Brent Xu, Gregory Landua or Felix Lutsch, but also high-profile speakers from the broader Cryptoverse such as Meltem Demirors, Tegan Kline, Marc Zeller and more.\n\nAs we get closer to the event, we will try to embed more exciting things that will make Cosmoverse a great success.

Given that Cosmoverse was just an idea ~5 weeks ago and things are moving incredibly fast, the cost and budget planning is one of the hardest tasks for us at the moment.\n\nIn addition, given that we are just a team of 6-enthusiastic Cosmonauts without a company that could bail us out, we need to be incredibly cautious with our finances and avoid illiquidity.\n\nThe main cost-factors for this event (for 320 people) are:\nVenue incl. catering: ~ $36,500 per day\nAV + branding: ~ $34,200 total\nAfterparty: ~ $20,000\nAdditional expenses: tbd\nTeam expenses: tbd\nTeam compensation: tbd\n\nThe cost for the venue would increase by ~$19,000 per day if we could host 500 guests instead of 320.\n\nIn case there is going to be a profit left, we plan to use this as starting liquidity for the next Cosmoverse conference.\n\nCurrent sponsors are:\nCosmos Hub community pool ($34,000)\nCitizen Cosmos ($5,000)\nStargaze ($5,000)\nSentinel ($5,000)\nRegen Network ($5,000)\nUmee ($5,000)\ne-Money ($5,000)\nCommercio ($5,000)\n\nCosmoverse is a community-effort that is financed in a hybrid manner by companies and DAOs. The first one ever? In the future, we envision Cosmoverse to become a fully DAO-funded endeavor that will take place annually.\n\n\nTickets\nThe goal is also to keep the ticket prices extremely affordable (from 39€) which is very competitive to other crypto-conferences happening in Lisbon around the same time (tickets cost up to €1,000). The ticket also includes F&B throughout both days at the conference as well as access and F&B at the afterparty venue. Our goal is to provide as much value as possible for attending Cosmonauts, while also investing funds into media coverage to provide high-quality, free broadcasting of the event.

For an approved pool with external incentives, the model would set a minimum incentive share with Osmo to match the USD value of the external incentives.\\n\\nThese incentive matches would be decided by governance on a case by case basis, and should be limited to some overall % of Osmo Incentives. I propose that we start with a soft limit of 20% of incentives, so matching no more than ~400,000 USD per day of external incentives.\\n\\nI also propose that we begin by matching the external incentives currently being paid by E-Money to pools 461, and 482.

The timing of this upgrade is crucial to properly execute the [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) airdrop clawback. This clawback should happen right at the Airdrop end date of December 15th 5PM UTC, thus this upgrade must execute before it. \\n\\nThe upgrade block height `2383300` is estimated to be at December 14th, UTC 2:30PM. Block times have high variance, so please be monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \\n\\n## Upgrade features\\n\\nThis upgrade adds features such as:\\n\\n- Upgrade Cosmos-SDK to [SDK v0.44](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) from SDK v0.42 For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see its [changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21). Noteable highlights include:\\n    - [Authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) - Allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). \\n- New modules:\\n    - [Bech32IBC](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/bech32-ibc) - Allows auto-routing of send msgs to addresses on other chains, once configured by governance. Allows you to do a bank send on Osmosis to a cosmos1... address, and it is automatically sent to the corresponding Cosmos Hub address over IBC. This is a big step in enabling more seemless IBC UX.\\n    - [TxFees](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/x/txfees) - Enables validators to easily accept txfees in multiple assets, whitelisted by governance, by declaring minimum fees in OSMO.  Alternative fee assets are converted to their OSMO value, using the spot price on their primary OSMO base pair pool.  This upgrade pre-whitelists all the assets currently supported on the Osmosis frontend with an OSMO basepair pool.\\n- Implements [Proposal 32](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/32) - Clawback of unclaimed Osmo and Ion on airdrop end date. (December 15th, 5PM UTC)\\n- Upgrade IBC from a standalone module in the SDK to [IBC v2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). This improves the utility of Ethereum Bridges and Cosmwasm bridges.\\n- Blocking [OFAC banned ETH addresses](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sanctions/1.0/sdn_advanced.xml) \\n- Numerous minor bug fixes, gas fixes, and significant speedups.\\n\\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\\n\\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\\n\\nAll nodes will require 32GB of memory. Swap can be used to achieve this, but getting nodes with 32GB RAM is _significantly_ preferred. Furthermore, NVMe SSDs significantly improve the speed of execution.\\n\\nPlease follow the setup instructions here for how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v5.x/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v5/guide.md).\\n\\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you have to install cosmovisor from the SDK v0.42.9 branch) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v5.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v5.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin/`.\\n\\nIf you do not want to use cosmovisor due to cosmovisor reliability issues, please be prepared to upgrade at around 2:30PM UTC, December 14th if this proposal passes.\\n\\n## Details of upgrade time\\n\\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the Osmosis blockchain will be halted.

By voting Yes on this proposal will signify approval for both a loan of OSMO to Stargaze, and Stargaze will then launch and LBP with the following parameters with that funding. \nThe request for a loan of 135,000 OSMO (~$724K) from the Osmosis community treasury to a multi-sig controlled by community members. Stargaze will use this OSMO to launch a 95/5 Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) on Osmosis. \n\nThe members of this multi-sig will include: \n- James Parillo, Figment\n- Shane Vitarana, Stargaze\n- Cosmostation\n\nBased on the LBP mechanics and OSMO volumes, the starting price of STARS will be $0.28.\nStargaze will pay back the value of the original loan in STARS once the LBP has ended.\nThere will be a 0.3% swap fee - Osmosis and Stargaze community pools will split the rewards of this fee 50/50.\n\nOsmosis multi-sig public address: osmo1s3unu92e8zv8mfw7n5d4vrgkj9chn7yv0sh8rw \n\nStargaze multi-sig public address: stars1s3unu92e8zv8mfw7n5d4vrgkj9chn7yvnhn27d\n\n\nBackground:\nLBPs are a way to ensure a fair distribution of tokens at launch and to discover a fair market price of the token with low capital requirements. A 95/5 pool will have 95% of STARS to 5% of OSMO value. Over a period of 3 days, the goal is for the pool to reach 50/50 value.\nLBPs allow teams to build liquidity without a large amount of upfront capital. It also separates the mechanisms for distributing tokens from the token price. This will be the first community pool loan for Osmosis and Stargaze.\nLiquidity pools work within the crypto space with automated market makers, providing token holders and networks with liquidity through decentralized mechanisms. Liquidity pools usually only have a 50/50 ratio, where the value of Asset A equals the value of Asset B.\n\nPotential Risks:\nIf there are no purchases for STARS, the price would fall to zero as the weighting decreases and the fluctuation in weighting creates constant downward pressure on the price.\n\nDetails about the LBP:\nStart Time: December 16th, 2021 19:00 UTC\nEnd Time: December 19th, 2021\n\nStarting Liquidity: 50,000,000 STARS and 135,000 OSMO\n\nStart Ratio: 95/5\nEnd Ratio: 50/50\n\nStarting Price:\nSTARS Price: $0.28 USD\nOSMO\nPrice: $5.50 USD",false],["Regen token transfer\n\nThis is a signalling proposal for the transfer of 1.399mm $REGEN to the Osmosis community.\n\nThis transfer will be to the community pool address, giving osmo holders ownership and ability to utilize these tokens through the existing osmosis governance process.\n\nWe expect this allocation to be used strategically for protocol-owned liquidity provision, use-cases exploring eco-credits, modest provision of yield farming provisions, matching grants to public goods, and open-source development funding.\n\nWe propose the main criteria for judging use-cases should be the long term strategic benefit to leveraging the Osmosis DEX in partnership with Regen Network as an originator for ecological assets that create a new Regenerative Finance asset class native to our growing IBC ecosystem.\n\nVoting YES on this proposal signals the Osmosis community’s willingness to receive this grant, and govern it for LONG TERM strategic benefit as outlined broadly above.\nVoting NO would bump the conversation back to the forum posts and postpone a token transfer.\n\nHere is the Commonwealth discussion.\nhttps://commonwealth.im/osmosis/proposal/discussion/2343-regen-dao-to-dao-token-grant\n\nHere is the Regen Network governance forum discussion.\nhttps://forum.regen.network/t/cosmos-ecosystem-allocation/259",false],["Signaling Proposal: Incentivize JUNO/UST Pool #580\n\n**Proposal Details**\\n\\nThis is a signaling proposal to include JUNO/UST Pool #580 into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives.\\n\\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to this JUNO/UST liquidity pool on Osmosis.\\n\\nBy voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to this JUNO/UST liquidity pool on Osmosis.",false],["[Action Required] IBC patch upgrade at 2464000\n\n# [Action Required] IBC patch upgrade at 2464000\\\\n\\\\nThe v5 upgrade had a subtle bug that prevents creation of new IBC channels.\\\\n\\\\nNo current user funds are at risk, and the bug does not affect trading, LP, bonding.\\\\n\\\\nAll existing IBC channels function just as before, IBC deposits and withdrawals for existing assets are not affected.\\\\n\\\\nThe bug solely prevents new channels from being created, preventing new chains from connecting to Osmosis. Bug details at the end.\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal suggests doing an emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v6 binary. This upgrade will not require any synchronous state migrations. The [v6.0.0 software version](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v6.0.0) is fully state-compatible with `v5.0.0` until the upgrade block `2464000`, at which point they diverge. This is the same upgrade mechanism as the Osmosis v3 upgrade (prop 17), used when the governance deposit mechanism was broken.\\\\n\\\\nThe proposed upgrade block height of 2464000 is estimated to be at December 20, 2021, 16:00 UTC (Monday).\\\\n\\\\nAll validators, and full node operators should update their software to version `v6.0.0` prior to block height 2464000. After doing so, validators should deposit on this proposal.\\\\n\\\\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash -- requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\\\\n\\\\n## Actionable(s)\\\\n\\\\n* Every node should upgrade their software version from `v5.0.0` to `v6.0.0` before the upgrade block height 2464000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at `upgrades/v5/bin` to be `v6.0.0`, and restart the node. Do check that `cosmovisor version` says 6.0.0.\\\\n* Upon upgrading their setup, every validator should place a deposit on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade. (1uosmo suffices)\\\\n* Every node should check in between December 20th 4AM UTC and 4PM UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have put a non-zero deposit on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didnt upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of validators have not signalled readiness by this time, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should downgrade their binary back to v5.0.0 for further coordination.\\\\n\\\\n## Failure case and risks involved\\\\n\\\\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start. In this situation we propose coordination by social consensus on the Osmosis Discord - \"validators\" channel. (https://discord.gg/osmosis)\\\\n\\\\nNote: While not required, it is highly recommended for each validator to use the Tendermint KMS system to reduce the risk of potential double-signing if they fail to upgrade on time, and the upgrade proceeds.\\\\n\\\\n## Governance procedure\\\\n\\\\n A Yes vote on this proposal signals a desire to follow this plan to expediently recover the ability to create new IBC channels.\\\\n A No vote on this proposal signals that another plan should be formed.\\\\n\\\\nDeposits are intended to be used by validators here.\\\\n\\\\n- Each validator signals their readiness and approval of this rocedure by depositing 1uosmo to this proposal from their validator operator key. Please do this, even if your validator operator key is behind a multisig. This is a good time to take advantage of authz, to allow easier depositing & voting.\\\\n- Once over 66% of voting power has signalled readiness, this upgrade proposal is considered valid.\\\\n- Should this proposal fail to gather readiness signalling from two-thirds of voting power by December 20th 4AM UTC, the upgrade proposal should be considered failed and validators should revert to the old binary prior to block 2464000.\\\\n\\\\n## Testing methodology\\\\n\\\\nThis upgrade has been tested to be compatible with v5.0.0 until the upgrade height on a testnet. This was done by having a v6.0.0 validator and a v5.0.0 full node peered to each other. Prior to upgrade height, both would reject channel open txs. Past upgrade height, the validator would accept channel opens, and the v5.0.0 full node would crash with a conflicting state hash (as expected). The v6.0.0 node could then receive IBC transfers.\\\\n\\\\n## Bug Details\\\\n\\\\nRelevant issue: [osmosis-labs/osmosis #665](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/665)\\\\n\\\\nTL;DR - There was a subtle misconfiguration in the Osmosis app.go.

In defense of proposal 127, this was done, due to the 20% cap for external incentive matching being made without a clear guideline for how it'll be enforced being agreed upon.

Namely, make external incentive matching follow the same bias factor present in Osmosis. This concretely means that the Osmo-side bonus APY for external incentive ATOM pools will halve.

However, the recent external incentives for STARS, HUAHUA and CMDX, as well as the proposed external ROWAN incentives in #132, have been substantially higher than previous ones. Matching these has resulted in a large amount of the daily Osmosis incentive distribution being used for matching purposes and has had proportionately reduced the APR across other pools without matching incentives.\\n A bias to external incentives has been confirmed in Proposal 128. This is not a simple weighting to provide non-Osmosis incentives 50% of the rewards that Osmosis pools do. Instead the weight of non-OSMO pools is decreased by 50% as well as the weight of OSMO pools being raised by 50%.\\n As a result of this, on the next semi-automatic incentives proposal, each  of external incentives on non-OSMO pools will not only be matched by bash.50 in OSMO rewards, but would also result in OSMO pools being matched by .50. (In both instances up to the 30% overall cap coming into effect). \\n\\n This proposal requests that the maximum match for  in external incentives is  in OSMO. \\n\\n These external incentives have also generated a lot of hype around high APRs, partially funded by Osmosis matching these high external incentives on new pools. This may have caused price increases of these tokens as liquidity providers seek to buy in to pools with higher APRs. In turn causing the price to further increase and therefore requiring even more OSMO to match the, now higher, dollar value of external incentives.\\n In order to ensure that the OSMO spent on matching these external incentives is useful for the ecosystem, this proposal requests that a cap on the dollar value of OSMO used for matching be added based on the fees generated by the pool. Fees generated give an indicator of how actively a pool is used and the value that the additional liquidity attracted by this external matching will bring to Osmosis. This cap would be based on the Subsidy Bias model that is in use for normal incentives, promoting the addition of external incentives on OSMO pools and reducing Osmosis' spend on other pools. I.E.  of fees generated in OSMO pools would allow, currently, 3x the dollar amount of OSMO to be available to meet external matching up to the other caps compared to  of fees in a non-OSMO pool.\\n\\n In short this limits the bonus OSMO APR provided by the incentive matching program to the non-matched APR. \\n\\n  Whichever of these caps is hit first would be the maximum dollar amount of OSMO that Osmosis uses to match incentives. \\n\\n Model based on figures from the Semi-Automatic Incentives Proposal #131: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUST7SUkdr3__HgMqfFxItkmTaXhd1Nmsk-Ji0EASNs \\n\\n Commonwealth Thread on fee based cap: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3578-proposal-external-incentive-matching-caps-on-asset-pairs \\n\\n Commonwealth Thread on 1:1 matching: https://gov.osmosis.zone/proposal/discussion/3577-proposal-osmo-bias-on-external-incentives-should-not-overmatch-dollar-value/",false],["Italian Educational Content\n\nWe are requesting a community pool spend to create high-quality educational content about Osmosis for the Italian Proof of Stake community, and help us support the network long term.

UST adoption has to a large extent been driven by shady activities and circumvention of regulation. This includes enticing the wider public to trade regulated products without any consumer protection (Mirror Protocol) and luring savers with high returns without explaining the risk of losing the principal (Anchor Protocol) when/if UST collapses.\n2. Like Stripper Dollars, UST provides no clear benefits compared to \"the real deal\", i.e. a USD backed stablecoin. Only Luna holders benefit from the minting of UST.\n3. Stripper Dollars have a tendency to become worthless overnight. Algorithmic stablecoins have a similar track record.\n\nIs UST really the best USD stablecoin for Osmosis? It seems like we could easily do better by adopting an existing USD backed stablecoin such as USDC.\n\nWhen evaluating the commentary and voting on this proposal, keep in mind that key figures from in the Cosmos ecosystem are heavily invested in Luna and thus have strong economic incentive to see UST and Luna integrated in Osmosis, regardless of risk and long term consequences to the ecosystem.\n\nVoting *YES* on this proposal signal that we, as the broader community,\n\n1.

In a short span of time, they have established partnerships with some of the largest SSI software vendors in the world. They want to bring identity to the IBC stack in a way that preserves user privacy and bring Cosmos to the SSI community. Currently, there are CHEQ external incentives on CHEQ:OSMO (pool #602) which are matched with OSMO incentives; as well as CHEQ external incentives on ATOM:CHEQ (pool #617). \n\n*Proposal Discussion on Commonwealth: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3671-incentivize-atomcheq-pool-617 \n\n *Learn more about cheqd*: \n - Telegram: https://t.me/cheqd \n - Twitter: https://twitter.com/cheqd_io \n - Website: https://cheqd.io \n Medium blog: https://blog.cheqd.io \n Product Roadmap for 2022: https://cheqd.link/product-vision-2022",false],["Allocate 125k Osmo from the OCP to give Support/Marketing access to guidance on business matters related to Defi, DAOs, and structuring.\n\nThis proposal is to allocate 125k OSMO to a multi-sig wallet controlled by members of the Osmosis Support Lab and Osmosis Ministry of Marketing.  The wallet will then delegate all funding to Redline validation in exchange for consulting services related to Defi, DAOs,and structuring.  This delegation will hold for a minimum of 6 months.  At the end of 6 months the two working groups will assess if we need to increase, decrease or undelegate funding.  Any funds not used for delegations to Redline will be sent directly back to the community pool.  When services are no longer needed or wanted, this funding will return directly back to the community pool.  This is a no loss scenario for the community pool, as the requested funds will never be spent or leave the multi-sig wallet except to be returned to the community pool. \n\n The members of the OSL and OMM have vetted Redline and its services and their current engagements with many reputable teams and projects. At a high level Redline will be providing key services and recommendations to reduce major bottlenecks related to structuring recommendations, support, and logistical help. In fact they have already completed bodies of work. Given our previous unsuccessful efforts to solicit these services from various other vendors, Redline has already delivered better than expected results in a timely manner \n\n This approach will be the first example of community funded consultation for community funded initiatives.  The delegation will ensure the two groups can confidently engage with adequate consulting teams necessary for them to have maximum impact with the funding allocated to them.  This service can be used by other working groups in Osmosis and is not exclusive to Support and Marketing.  We advise all teams and users to engage with Redline before committing any delegations as they will be a 100% validator \n\n About Redline: \n “Redline specializes in consulting services and helps crypto teams, foundations, and DAOs navigate through the unique hurdles presented to crypto and DeFi.  Our unique model provides access to top-tier talent without any out-of-pocket costs or traditional bottlenecks.   We are quick to execute an engagement, are fully transparent, and are tailored for the dynamic crypto environment.” \n\n Discussion can be found here: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3790-legaldaos-and-a-decentralized-path-forward \n You can read about and engage with Redline here: https://www.redlinevalidation.com/ \n Connect with working groups  \n OSL Twitter https://twitter.com/OsmoSupportDao \n OMM Twitter https://twitter.com/OsmoMinistryMkt \n\n Vote Yes: If you support sending this delegation to Redline to support our two community funded groups. \n\n Vote No: If you do not approve of delegating this funding to Redline in an effort to support our two community funded groups. \n\n Multi sig wallet address: osmo1nmkn238s58lmnkv0nvc5m6tajg9y8g8zujwjh3 \n Redline validator address: osmovaloper1qylzyxxz8x358670tpuqnf2kjezacahcztgg8f",false],["Remove incentives from all xki pools\n\nxki has some kind of system or user that trades once per minute or so, at fixed intervals, using the same amount of dollar denominated value.

My name is Anthony Rosa, and I am the project lead at Moultrie Audits. Centralized entities like Tether are holding firm to protect censorship resistance (https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1562468486886346753?s=20&t=R3Gc5J6rUnSfOzeYxNZyuw). There are many aspects to this conversation, and it is encouraged to read through the associated commonwealth threads (linked below) prior to voting. The blocked.go file prevents users from withdrawing to the contained blocked addresses, and the file comments state “we block all OFAC-blocked ETH addresses from receiving tokens.” If we accept as a community that we should censor addresses the government deems illegitimate, our entire purpose becomes questionable.\\n\\n # Reasons To Delete blocked.go\\n\\nWhy have a blockchain if the service retains the censorship restrictions of Web2? How can we claim to be decentralized while preventing users from accessing a service through a central repository subject to revision by the government? Why wouldn’t this set a censorship precedent? Are we here to make money or change the world? \\n\\nIt is my opinion that it’s better if we fail trying to democratize finance with a truly decentralized DEX than succeed as a TradFi proxy, touting disingenuous values. In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated, “If we do nothing about it now, you will see a slow but steady erosion of your right to trade freely...We need to come together and support our freedom to trade crypto in the spirit with which most of it has been developed – permissionlessly.”\\n\\n# Counterarguments\\n\\nThere are severe possible consequences for not complying with OFAC or any other government requirement to block specific addresses. Removing the functionality to block addresses at a protocol level opens up financial and legal risk to infrastructure providers, developers, users, investors, and the entire Osmosis community. Validator level censorship is still a possibility, but an additional burden.\\n\\n In the commonwealth discussion (linked below), one member stated “I don't think this is morally the right direction, by the US government, or by implementing these policies. However, I do think logically it is the best step forward to preserve and protect our validators.” \\n\\n# Vote Explanation\\n\\nYes: Developers should move to remove the blocked.go file from the Osmosis repo. We’ll start by deleting the addresses in the file.\\n No: We should keep the blocked.go file and associated functionality.\\nNo With Veto: You believe this proposal is spam or malicious to Osmosis and we should keep the blocked.go file and associated functionality.

Rekt Lunatic, started vigorously supporting Kujira since May 2022 just because I once again found confirmation of my experience of what distinguishes bad projects and teams from good ones. Representative from the Russian-speaking community (https://t.me/kujira_ru). I act as a channel admin and a consultant for the community members. Also, whenever possible, I voluntarily help the Kujira team in finding bugs in the products. As a private investor, I am in the list of the top 100 KUJI stakers, invested most of my capital in KUJI. Project success == my success. My life principle is that if you take on something, do it well or don't take it at all.\n\n## Related Experience\n\nI had been working in IT for over 15 years. A computer science engineer by education, had the opportunity to try himself in different professions: Dev (C++), SRE (including as a team leader), DBA (including as a team leader), IT Infrastructure (middle manager), project manager. All this is in the different areas: healthcare, sports facilities, banking (the longest in time), and raw materials mining. In the distant past, I even tried to live off the income from trading (of course, it didn't work out). I really hope to apply my experience for the common good. Eventually, I fulfilled the dream of many spending nearly 80% of my time in Crypto right now.\n\n## Personal Statement\n\nMost of my time I am doing Kujira as an independent columnist, assistant, and consultant for the community, a modest generator of ideas and meanings. I am incredibly proud to be a part of the Kujira community because it has no equal anywhere in the Crypto world. I've seen a lot of teams around outside of Cosmos and there's not one even standing close to Kujira. I will continue to do what I am doing regardless of whether I am elected or not.

For the last two years she has led products in Web3 digital identity and DeFi for a number of Web3 startups. She is also an advisor to three Web3 projects: Kavarii, a decentralized video streaming service built on MultiversX; Valorize DAO, a suite of tools for DAOs on the Ethereum network; and a stealth NFT project launching on Ethereum in early 2023.\n\n## Related Experience\n\nVanessa has broad DeFi experience across a number of crypto ecosystems including Cosmos, Luna, Cardano, MultiversX, Polygon, Ethereum and of course Kujira. She brings a familiarity with algorithmic stablecoins, automated market makers, crypto onramps and offramps, decentralized lending and borrowing, and token launchpads. Much of her experience has been shared through her Youtube Channel, Just Crypto, as well as on Twitter. She is also proficient in the crucial crypto skill of meme making.  \n\n## Personal Statement\n\nCrypto is important because it allows for true ownership, transactions without a trusted intermediary, anonymity, transparent verification, equal access, freedom from government control and sound, predictable money. We're on the cusp of creating a new financial system that is more fair, more accessible. Yet we are beset on every side with centralized ponzi schemes, cash grabs disguised as businesses and DeFi reliant on inflationary tokenomics to survive. A decentralized economy needs decentralized money. It also needs to grow up. Kujira brings grown up DeFi and grown up governance to the Web3 economy. The Kujira team has shown resilience through the greatest of storms and is building at a rapid pace with a best in class user experience. Most importantly they displayed strength of character in offering KUJI holders one for one redemption on the new Kujira blockchain after Luna collapsed.

So in a way, my experience goes back as far as possible… Pre-crypto I worked as an actor, comedian, and filmmaker, and during this time I was involved in securing finance for a television pilot. I also worked for a conference company for 5+ years and would converse with companies to bring them to events at varying rates on various packages depending on their needs (group attendance, sponsorship etc). I would also assist startups in arranging meetings with Private Investors and Family Offices. I have also been a part of Kujira since pre-IDO. I have consistently been a believer and supporter and this led to the creation of Kuji Kast early this year. As part of making the show, I follow all the happenings of Kujira on a daily basis as well as speaking closely with each protocol that either has or is planning to launch.    \n\n## Personal Statement\n\nI believe very strongly in what Kujira is doing and have the strongest desire to see it grow. Having spoken directly with each protocol and forged strong relationships with them I have gained strong insight into who they are, what they require, and what they intend to achieve. I plan to continue to do this with each emerging project. I believe I will add a different element to the Senate; I see protocols and the people within them as essentially assets. For Kujira to be special we need to attract the best; I feel sometimes we as a community can be critical of newcomers (as we need to be) but also I see a need to balance this and ensure we create a welcoming environment where the best people want to be.

I've been working full-time in crypto since early 2021. I believe that crypto can change the world for the better and aim to help in that vision. Member of Kuji DAO.\n\n## Related Experience\n\nI've been in crypto since 2017, since then I've done everything from trading to NFTs, DeFi designing, and getting rugged. Currently I work as an analyst, most publicly with The Birb Nest as their Lead Fundamental Analyst. Also do research work with Apex Digital and other private advising for protocols and projects. I am the Treasury lead for Pozzle Planet, a protocol on Polygon, where we have not only applied for funding across different funds and VCs but also designed tokenomics and how the protocol captures revenue. Also am a DeFi Clan lead with Rekt Gang (NFT). I am also a Co-founder of Kuji DAO, however, I would not let this influence any of my decisions. Also, the DAO has 9 other members so I am only 1 vote there. In the past I've worked with startups, and also largely been an athlete so a bit of a diverse background.\n\n## Personal Statement\n\nI wish to push the growth and improvement of Kujira, this position is a way that I can contribute to the positive growth of the Kujira ecosystem. I believe many projects and protocols have struggled with their use of funds and often this comes back to bite them.

Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. \\n\\n## Upgrade features\\n\\nThis upgrade adds the following features:\\n* Superfluid Staking\\n* Permissioned CosmWasm\\n* IAVL improvements (improved epoch times)\\n* UX improvements around LP bonding\\n\\nSee more in the [changelog](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/v7.0.0/CHANGELOG.md)\\n\\n## Getting prepared for the upgrade\\n\\nAll nodes will require 64GB of memory. This must consist of a **minimum** of 32GB of RAM, while the remaining 32GB can be swap. For best results, use 64GB of physical memory. Note that this is **double the recommendation for the Boron upgrade**. Also note that the inclusion of wasm means that nodes must use amd64 to run.\\n\\nPlease refer to the following setup instructions on how to add swap (if needed), and how to configure cosmovisor to automatically switch binaries for this upgrade: [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md).\\n\\nNamely, configure cosmovisor to auto-restart. (Please note, you should install the v1.0.0 release of cosmovisor) Then either auto-download binaries or manually build & copy the `osmosisd` [`v7.0.0`](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0) binary to `.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin/`.\\n\\nIf you do not wish to use cosmovisor, be prepared to upgrade at around 8:00PM UTC, February 28th if this proposal passes.\\n\\nThe Osmosis blockchain will halt when network reaches the halt height. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used to `v7.0.0`, and the chain will proceed post upgrade.\\n\\n## Details of upgrade time\\n\\nThe proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be `3401000`, anticipated to be at `Monday February 28th 8:00PM UTC`. This uses a 1 day average block time of 6.46 seconds per block, derived from the Mintscan block explorer. Note that block times have high variance, so keep monitoring the time.\\n\\nThe upgrade is anticipated to take approx 120 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.\\n\\nIn the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the validators channel in discord.\\n\\n### Testing your upgrade setup\\n\\nThere is a testnet which full nodes can sync to, to test that they have setup cosmovisor correctly on a new node. See `#testnet-announcements` and `#testnet-discussion` channels in the Osmosis Discord.\\n\\n\\n### Superfluid delegation \\n\\nIn this upgrade\"s superfluid module, you can stake LP shares for specific governance-approved pools. A \"superfluid discount factor\" parameter exists for the superfluid module to ensure stability in the early rollout of superfluid staking, the superfluid discount factor parameter is set to 50% in this upgrade. This parameter can be adjusted by Osmosis governance.\\n\\nThe user can designate one superfluid validator to delegate to for each superfluid enabled liquidity pool.\\n\\nHere is an example for how it would work with ATOM-OSMO pool:\\n\\n#### On Delegation Voting Power and Slashing\\n*Condition*\\n- Suppose the spot price in the pool is 1 ATOM = 2 OSMO.\\n- Suppose you have provided 100 OSMO and 50 ATOM worth of liquidity to Pool #1.\\n- Suppose you have designated validator \"Dogemosis\" as your superfluid validator.\\n- Superfluid discount factor is set to 10%\\n\\n*Result*\\n- Your delegation to \"Dogemosis\" will increase by `100 OSMO * (1-DISCOUNT_FACTOR) = 90 OSMO`.\\n- You would then get staking rewards for an equavalent amount of 90 OSMO delegated to Dogemosis. However, you also then take on slashing risk from Dogemosis.\\n- If Dogemosis gets a `5%` slash due to double signing, then `5%` of your **LP shares `(5 OSMO, 2.5 ATOM)`** get sent to the community pool. Note that slashing amount **does not** take into account the risk factor parameter, and slashes the entire amount of superfluided LP shares.

carbon, negatively affecting our climate. Regen Network, in partnership with Toucan and Moss.Earth, have already launched a version of NCT on Polygon at a price of $10 per credit.\nThis proposal asks for a spend of 6,600 $OSMO from the Community Pool to purchase 5,100 NCT from Regen Network to cover Osmosis’ historical carbon emissions, confirming Osmosis' carbon neutrality blockchain up to June 2022.\n\nMethod\n These funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of \nCory Levinson (Regen Network)\nJohnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)\nNosNode (Osmosis Validator)\n\nThe $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase NCT. This will then be retired to offset Osmosis’ carbon emissions.\nAny $OSMO remaining due to price fluctuations below the intentional 20% buffer to mitigate any price volatility, and a potentially lower NCT cost, will be returned to the Osmosis Community Pool.\n\nDiscussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3936-proposal-osmosis-carbon-market-with-regen-network",false],["Match External Incentives for SWTH/OSMO\n\n\n**Proposal Details**\n\nMatch external incentives provided by Carbon for [SWTH/OSMO (#651)](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/651).

As a custom-built sidechain, Carbon is designed specifically for trading sophisticated financial instruments such as options, bonds and futures at scale.

Marble is building a platform with several helpful tools for the Cosmos ecosystem such as:\n• Dashboards with relevant information about the DAO, $MARBLE, $BLOCK and other tokens (for example price charts, on-chain data)\n• DEX with $BLOCK as incentives\n• NFTs Marketplace where community can trade the \"Marblenauts\" and the \"Marble NFTs\"\n• Marble aims to create value in the Treasury and spread it among its members.

Due to Osmosis paying for liquidity based on fees, any fees generated by trading in this pool would result in Osmosis paying to incentivize liquidity that is not needed due to the unbonded protocol liquidity. This instead can act as a source of both tokens to seed other, incentivized pools, to increase liquidity and so stability of both NCT and REGEN across Osmosis as a whole through arbitrage.\nAs an added benefit, based on average swap fees, around 5,400 NCT would be acquired by this community pool held liquidity per year. A portion of this can be routinely retired and cause Osmosis’ carbon neutrality to be self-sustaining.\nThe remaining REGEN will be used to incentivize the NCT/OSMO pool to attract deeper liquidity, an arbitrage option for NCT/REGEN and a route to the Osmosis base pair for ease of trading. Around 165,000 REGEN should remain in the community pool after the previous two proposals, providing incentives of approximately $1,500 per day for 90 days.\nIncluding a 20% buffer for price volatility, this proposal asks for a community pool spend of 140,000 $OSMO and 1,399,507 $REGEN to establish the Osmosis’ community pool share of this liquidity.\nIn order to ensure that supply and demand do not place an artificial premium on NCT, the pools will only become available on Osmosis once the ability to tokenise existing offchain carbon credits, non-custodially bridge NCT from Polygon across to the IBC and retire NCT on Regen is fully available to the average user through frontend tooling. This spend is being requested early as the cost of a Carbon Credit has recently been lower than usual and so Osmosis will be able to purchase this liquidity at a reduced rate in preparation for a coordinated launch.\n\nBenefits to Osmosis\n The spend would be retained in the community pool as protocol owned liquidity and so no value should be lost from this proposal.\nSwap fees in this pool, at Osmosis average, would generate around $54,000 in revenue each year for the protocol.\n Retiring a portion of this revenue each year will ensure that Osmosis remains carbon neutral permanently.\n Through encouraging use of the Regen Network, the value of Osmosis protocol owned liquidity will increase to cater for projects yet to be connected via IBC. \n\nMethod\nThese funds will be sent to a multisig address consisting of \n   Cory Levinson (Regen Network)\n   Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Support Lab)\n    Nos Node (Osmosis Validator)\n\nThe $OSMO will be transferred to a corresponding multisig wallet on the Regen Network over IBC and used to purchase the NCT.\nThe NCT and any remaining $OSMO will then be returned to the multisig address on Osmosis.\n200 $OSMO will then be used to establish NCT/REGEN and a OSMO/NCT pool on Osmosis. These costs are paid into the community pool.\nAll of the $NCT will then be paired with $REGEN in a ratio to maintain the purchase price of $NCT.\nThe GAMM tokens for NCT/REGEN will then be returned, unbonded, to the Osmosis Community Pool, along with any remaining $OSMO tokens.\nAny remaining REGEN will be loaded as external incentives on the OSMO/NCT pool over a 90 day period, start time to be determined when NCT on Regen is fully live.\n\nDiscussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/3936-proposal-osmosis-carbon-market-with-regen-network",false],["Increase Voting Period to 5 days\n\nVoting Yes to this proposal raises the governance parameter Voting_Period to five days./n/nVoting No to this proposal causes the governance parameter Voting_Period to remain at three days./n/nBackground/nThree day voting periods have enabled rapid change, something integral to the experimental spirit of Osmosis. The short voting period allows patches to be deployed rapidly, rapid iteration of proposals to find an acceptable choice as well as the incentives allocated to pools to be adjusted in response to recent volume changes.\nHowever, the submission of a proposal to chain sparks debate from those who may not have had the opportunity to feedback on the proposal's wording and intent due to other commitments. The three day voting period gives a sense of urgency to debate with voters potentially unable to impartially weigh both sides. This is further exacerbated by proposals which are put to chain on the weekend which minimises the work days that validators and delegators have to research and discuss whilst on chain. Proposals posted on commonwealth often have issues that appear when exposed to this wider audience that need to be resolved./nThere is a github issue that would allow the best of both worlds, but this takes time to develop from an already busy development schedule. https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/567/nRaising the voting time from a three day period to a five day period will allow more thorough discussion to occur on proposals put on chain in exchange for lowering the speed of governance changes on Osmosis./n/nCommonwealth Post: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3929-proposal-increase-param-voting_period-to-5-days",false],["Semi-Automatic Incentive Adjustments for 03/28/2022\n\nAdjustment Proposal in accordance with model of Prop 54 \\n\\n Static copy of spreadsheet with data used to generate proposal: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aYyFC_BMPI2oOXMvoWYALCAsHsXwvjHKzlDeiaCe528/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\nMain auto updating sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1el4vImD9KqerdiUBbjG2tz_84Sx7XIxy2Lpg6HC5qrU/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\nOnboarding for pool 649 (prop 180)\\nMatching incentives for pool 651 (prop 178)\\nThis adjustment also implicitly grants regular incentive onboarding to pool 651, as otherwise the caps of prop 133 would result in nullifying the effects of prop 178\\n\\n\\nCurrent Osmo per day:\\n\\n1, 98586.60333\\n2, 983.9673014\\n3, 1087.047711\\n4, 399.6158417\\n5, 967.196178\\n6, 259.6744834\\n7, 225.4086345\\n8, 128.0775729\\n9, 2595.889668\\n10, 645.6504254\\n13, 698.9338533\\n15, 1321.823703\\n22, 115.7960717\\n42, 182.9595036\\n183, 10.09753849\\n197, 53.19791126\\n461, 49.67857374\\n463, 522.0690528\\n464, 10.47907415\\n481, 1501.181642\\n482, 390.2057252\\n497, 35547.74946\\n498, 11056.29813\\n548, 39.39026742\\n549, 1.437336912\\n553, 140.8096809\\n555, 24.95111629\\n557, 11.64341572\\n558, 7.860950161\\n560, 99540.9753\\n561, 40315.04407\\n562, 22709.08778\\n565, 1148.389435\\n567, 252.8331544\\n571, 678.0349088\\n572, 102.7646556\\n573, 221.0736001\\n574, 63.68356361\\n577, 1284.788432\\n578, 389.903128\\n579, 0\\n580, 33.93693881\\n584, 5390.671241\\n585, 1135.782312\\n586, 236.4008083\\n587, 196.161953\\n592, 57.27639586\\n596, 17.41249797\\n597, 35.84132799\\n600, 1186.378545\\n601, 3167.555067\\n602, 103.8434805\\n604, 10961.01618\\n605, 2970.376782\\n606, 1025.995427\\n608, 366.3860595\\n610, 60.60496555\\n611, 1621.908075\\n612, 696.6380611\\n613, 70.56436182\\n615, 12.8735393\\n616, 6.591357374\\n617, 8.804922001\\n618, 165.1194226\\n619, 1151.241085\\n621, 160.9718669\\n625, 1897.021596\\n626, 76.5110555\\n627, 813.3320573\\n629, 3880.500488\\n631, 2863.477727\\n637, 407.7399199\\n638, 69.0250628\\n641, 837.2536851\\n642, 101.5246647\\n643, 57.92105956\\n644, 40.66643841\\n645, 4.374503646\\n648, 411.9401013\\n649, 0\\n651, 0\\n\\n\\nProposed Osmo per day:\\n\\n\\n1, 99657.48523\\n2, 1079.002554\\n3, 1192.033933\\n4, 438.2123644\\n5, 1060.605266\\n6, 284.7523775\\n7, 247.1790807\\n8, 140.4488538\\n9, 2749.703417\\n10, 469.8836036\\n13, 766.4368517\\n15, 1449.482399\\n22, 126.9834668\\n42, 200.6310222\\n183, 11.07730876\\n197, 53.06335896\\n461, 52.29112712\\n463, 572.4898529\\n464, 11.49262672\\n481, 1421.549022\\n482, 347.6925168\\n497, 34865.22257\\n498, 10172.37635\\n548, 28.61151396\\n549, 1.576910386\\n553, 154.407431\\n555, 30.09757354\\n557, 12.77102732\\n558, 8.621092378\\n560, 100333.7007\\n561, 40678.33723\\n562, 18142.98995\\n565, 1259.302464\\n567, 236.9129398\\n571, 743.5197363\\n572, 112.6906885\\n573, 209.4889756\\n574, 41.90168873\\n577, 1408.87209\\n578, 427.5633523\\n579, 0\\n580, 22.71270103\\n584, 5416.083667\\n585, 1137.127601\\n586, 225.2321221\\n587, 147.8921304\\n592, 37.68361569\\n596, 19.0981369\\n597, 39.30595147\\n600, 1179.074715\\n601, 3398.426828\\n602, 113.8749936\\n604, 12019.61979\\n605, 3257.251168\\n606, 1127.25082\\n608, 401.7747026\\n610, 66.45736322\\n611, 1778.553746\\n612, 1024.777603\\n613, 46.43125025\\n615, 9.357632826\\n616, 4.338125897\\n617, 9.656142611\\n618, 181.0656526\\n619, 1262.427083\\n621, 105.9125696\\n625, 2104.675686\\n626, 88.03118453\\n627, 535.1307044\\n629, 4255.276453\\n631, 2602.424529\\n637, 447.1189879\\n638, 75.69169853\\n641, 918.1155139\\n642, 111.3311711\\n643, 63.51769077\\n644, 53.10229501\\n645, 5.86636621\\n648, 459.9192172\\n649, 47.32677961\\n651, 617.9671697\\n",false],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS, OSMO/SCRT and OSMO/CRO\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS (#604), OSMO/SCRT (#584) and OSMO/CRO (#9) pools on Osmosis. \\n\\n By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on OSMO/STARS (#604), OSMO/SCRT (#584) and OSMO/CRO (#9) pools on Osmosis. \\n\\n Details \\n This proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in three additional OSMO pools.

After this proposal has passed governance, this SWTH pool will be added to the regular incentive program of OSMO and will begin the onboarding process.\n\n**About Carbon (SWTH)**\n\nCarbon is a protocol that powers cross-chain financial markets and ecosystems. As a custom-purposed blockchain, Carbon is designed specifically to allow trading of sophisticated financial instruments such as options, bonds and futures at scale. Developers can also build any kind of DeFi application on top of Carbon, while enjoying multi-chain interoperability. Carbon is currently integrated across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Zilliqa, Neo, as well as any IBC-compatible chain such as Osmosis, Terra, and Cosmos Hub. Carbon currently powers decentralized, cross-chain order-book trading of spot and futures markets on Demex.\n\nSince the addition of the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis last month, the pool has already garnered over USD 1.72m in liquidity, with a 7D average trading volume of USD 137k.\n\nVia Carbon governance, additional SWTH rewards have been allocated to the OSMO/BUSD spot liquidity pool on Carbon, as well as the SWTH/OSMO pool on Osmosis.\n\nWebsite: [https://carbon.network](https://carbon.network)\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/0xcarbon](https://twitter.com/0xcarbon)\nTelegram: [https://t.me/switcheo](https://t.me/switcheo)\nDiscord: [https://discord.com/invite/SPh62Hf](https://discord.com/invite/SPh62Hf)",false],["Match External Incentives to extended STARS/OSMO and ATOM/STARS pairs\n\nSTARS incentives to Osmosis pools have been proposed in [Stargaze Prop 23](https://www.mintscan.io/stargaze/proposals/23).

VETO and ABSTAIN have their normal functions.\\n\\nLIMITATION OF SCOPE: A YES vote assents to these procedures ONLY for the series of five Osmosis governance proposals outlined below. To guard against malicious or confusing proposals, only proposals made by osmo19mywfjzj324w5ukf7ss6jak0dg9hnljfp0rfx4 will be considered under these rules. Future use of these (or similar) procedures must be separately approved by governance.\\n\\nAPPROVAL VOTING PROCEDURES: Five Osmosis Governance Proposals will be proposed under these rules, one each for the four bridge service providers being voted upon: 1) Axelar, 2) Gravity Bridge, 3) Nomad, and 4) Wormhole, as well as 5) a “do nothing” proposal.\\n\\nWINNER: The Bridge Service Provider (BSP) proposal (or “do nothing”) from this set that receives the highest total amount of YES voting power at the end of the collective voting period will win, provided that QUORUM is reached and a RUN-OFF is not activated. That BSP will enter into a relationship with Osmosis DAO whose initial parameters are outlined below.\\n\\nNO, NO WITH VETO, and ABSTAIN votes will have NO EFFECT on the tally of yes voting power for the approval voting results. In other words, a bridge could win the approval vote even if it has more NO/VETO vote power than YES, as long as it has the most YES voting power among the BSP proposals.\\n\\nQUORUM: As long as the total YES voting power received across the 5 approval voting proposals is equivalent to regular Osmosis quorum (20% of total Osmosis voting power), quorum will be considered to have been reached.\\n\\nRUN-OFF: At the end of the collective voting period, any BSP or “do nothing” proposal that has received within 15% of the leading proposal’s total will be entered into a run-off governed by these same rules and expectations, except that the run-off result will be final, with no further run-offs. This 15% will be measured as a percentage of the total voting power available on Osmosis for this set of proposals (NOT 15% of the top vote-getter’s YES voting power).\\nFor example, assuming 122M total staked OSMO available to vote, the 15% run-off spread is 18.3M. Therefore, if Bridge X gets 53M YES voting power, Bridge Y gets 35M, and Bridge Z gets 25M, Bridges X and Y will be entered into a run-off.\\n\\nBRIDGE SERVICE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP EXPECTATIONS:\\nThe Osmosis DAO is asking Osmosis Labs to integrate the BSP into app.osmosis.zone to provide canonical, unprefixed bridged assets from Ethereum. The implementation details will be left to Osmosis Labs and the chosen BSP, but the general shape of the initial expectations is as follows. These expectations are subject to change as circumstance, future governance, and social consensus dictate.\\n\\nFrom Osmosis, the BSP can expect:\\nDefault Asset List – the Ethereum assets bridged by the selected provider will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone default asset list – i.e. their bridged ETH and ERC-20 assets will be ETH, USDC, etc., all other bridges' assets would be bridge1ETH, bridge2USDC, and the like. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions. In the near future, we expect custom token lists to become the norm in Cosmos, as they are on Ethereum, so that users can search for and import tokens that they want to interact with.\\nOsmosis Incentives – the DAO commits to prioritizing the assets of the canonical bridge, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools–under the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching.\\nIntegration – Osmosis expects to work closely with the BSP. At the discretion of the Osmosis developers (subject to the advice and consent of the DAO) Osmosis will use the selected BSP for bridges beyond Ethereum (EVM or otherwise), unless another or better bridge is already available that the service provider cannot match (within whatever timeframe the Osmosis developers or DAO finds reasonable).\\n\\nFrom the BSP, Osmosis can expect:\\nIntegration / Availability – the BSP will help optimize integrations in a timely manner in accordance with Osmosis’ stated goals of achieving deposits and withdrawals from the app.osmosis.zone UI and Keplr Wallet (without pass-through to the bridge UI).\\nLiquidity Mining Incentives – if a project’s proposal included the promise of incentives (e.g. Axelar, at least 1% of Axelar tokens to be used for incentives on Osmosis).\\n\\nRevocability / At-will / Permissionless: As noted, these expectations are preliminary and subject to change as the DAO, developers, and the bridge team see fit. Osmosis DAO and the BSP will be working with each other for their mutual benefit, without contractual promise or obligation. It will be up to the BSP team to maintain a good relationship with Osmosis Labs regarding the front-end implementation details. Osmosis DAO empowers Osmosis Labs to change BSPs if in their estimation, the relationship has become unworkable, or the technical landscape suggests a superior solution, subject to ratification by the DAO.\\nShould the arrangement become unworkable for either party for whatever reason, the arrangement can be changed or terminated without notice. Any damages for bad behavior (broken promises, bridge failures) will be to reputation alone. Specific promises between the BSP and an individual user (e.g. bridge insurance) are not covered by this disclaimer, nor are potential future agreements between the DAO and various developers, teams, or individuals.\\n\\nFurther details and discussion: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4482-osmosis-canonical-ethereum-bridge-proposals",false],["Adopt Axelar as the Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider\n\nVoting YES to this proposal means that you want Axelar to be adopted as the Canonical Ethereum Bridge Service Provider. \\n\\nThis vote follows the rules set in Proposal 205 for this special approval voting process. \\nThat vote also set the preliminary expectations for the working relationship between the canonical bridge service provider and Osmosis. \\nFor further context see: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4482-osmosis-canonical-ethereum-bridge-proposals\\n\\nApproval voting procedures summary: \\nOnly YES votes will be counted.

As trades via OSMO pools usually benefit from their higher liquidity and so have lower slippage costs in comparison to non-OSMO pools they may still be the more optimal route for larger trades. The use of OSMO pools as the optimal trade route for user purchases is beneficial for Osmosis.\\n Ideally this would be voted on purely by Pool 1 Liquidity Providers, however pool sub-governance is not functional yet and so this will be asked of all Osmosis governance and implemented during the next software upgrade if passed. \\n Pool 1 Liquidity Providers specifically should see compensatory swap fees generated from the new routes passing through the pool as well as increased frequency of volatility harvesting as mentioned in the multihop proposal.\\n\\n Affected routes:\\n From Identical swap fees to Multihop being having lower swap fees: ATOM/JUNO, ATOM/STARS, ATOM/CMDX, ATOM/LUM, ATOM/NGM, ATOM/IOV\\n From higher swap fees in Multihop to Identical swap fees: ATOM/IXO, ATOM/DEC, ATOM/CHEQ\\n\\n For a full comparison of the swap fees by route before and after the change proposed see here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFI4S5wqDoC-WiUbWoLJ0dRbylqbvQ1ZTjpiN71lkGA\\n\\nFurther details and discussion: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/4340-reduce-osmoatom-pool-swap-fee-to-02",false],["Signalling Proposal for AssetMantle Incentivised pool\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/MNTL (#690) pool on Osmosis.\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in adding OSMO incentives to the OSMO/MNTL (#690) pool on Osmosis.\n\nDetails\nThis is a signalling proposal to include the OSMO/MNTL (#690) pool into the set of assets that receive OSMO liquidity incentives.

The community will be able to ask questions, listen to keynote speeches, and talk to Cosmos core developers face to face. This also gives Cosmos projects the opportunity to strengthen their relationship with the community.\n\nWhy should the funds from prop #110 be used for sponsorship?\n\nProp #110 was submitted by NosNodes (https://twitter.com/NosNodes) with the purpose to incentivize more community building by the Cosmoverse team. Thank you, NosNodes! <3\n\nAfter Prop #110 passed, the Cosmoverse team received 20,000 OSMO in funding. We are extremely grateful for that. \nWe were able to use the funds to organize meetups (like the Denver Meetup: https://twitter.com/CosmoverseHQ/status/1495248152865042434?s=20&t=MZgUGjZuO6tkZBDB5Jmnqw), pay the initial deposit for the Medellin conference and cover travel expenses. \nWithout Osmosis, Cosmoverse would never have become what it is today.\n\nHow does it benefit the Osmosis community?\n\nThe funds from Osmosis prop #110 will make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022. This comes with several benefits at the conference and marketing initiatives as we gain momentum.\n\n- Keynote speech: We offer two keynote slots to the Osmosis core team. Speakers TBA on our official Twitter account.\n- Booth in networking area: We offer Osmosis a prominent booth stand in the main networking area.\n- Logo placement: The Osmosis logo will be shown as “co-lead sponsor at the conference.\n- General Admission Tickets: We will give 10 general admission tickets to the Osmosis core team or the Osmosis community. Distribution TBD.\n- Logo Placement on Attendees batch: The logo will be displayed on the attendees' batches, which is a feature exclusive to the lead and co-lead sponsors.\n- Content distribution on the Cosmoverse Twitter account and Website\n\nYou decide:\n\n- By voting “Yes” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.\n- By voting “No” you believe that the funds provided by Osmosis proposal #110 should not be used to make Osmosis the co-lead sponsor of Cosmoverse 2022.\n- “No with Veto” punishes the Cosmoverse team for this proposal\n- Vote “Abstain” if you do not have an opinion",false],[" Match PSTAKE External Incentives for Pools #648\n\n**Proposal Details**\nMatch external incentives provided by the PSTAKE team for PSTAKE/OSMO (pool #648), the external incentives will continue for 90 epochs for 14 days bonding period. \n- By voting YES on this proposal, external PSTAKE incentives will be matched at ~$2,222 per day\n- By voting NO on this proposal, external PSTAKE incentives will NOT be matched at ~$2,222 per day\n\n**Context**\nThe PSTAKE team has allocated 500,000 PSTAKE across PSTAKE/OSMO pool 648 that amounts to ~$200,000 over the course of 90 epochs (Started on 07-05-2022)\nThe PSTAKE incentives are as follows:\n- PSTAKE/OSMO (Pool #648): ~5555 PSTAKE per day amounting to ~$2,222.\nTherefore, the final ask for the Osmosis incentive match is for ~$2,222 per day.\n \n**About [pSTAKE](https://pstake.finance/)** \npSTAKE, developed by Persistence, is a liquid staking solution that unlocks the potential of staked PoS assets (e.g. ATOM).

These incentives are crucial to help shift Osmosis liquidity away from Terra-based assets towards Ethereum-based stablecoins and major assets. However, these proposals are normal incentive adjustment proposals that go through the normal 5 day voting process (meaning they won't go into effect for 6 epochs).\\n \\n Because of the extremely volatile market conditions around Terra, we propose that we accelerate this process by using an 'emergency software upgrade' under special fast-voting rules to allow the incentives to shift faster than the normal 5 day voting period.\\n \\n The 'fast-voting process' would take the form of being enacted as soon as 2/3 of *total chain voting power* votes Yes on this proposal. At that time, if >2/3 of total voting power has voted Yes on each of #222, #223, and #224, then those proposals will be enabled during the upgrade process.

UST LP providers thought they were LP'ing with a stablecoin, and now they are facing significant further depeg risk. This proposal seeks to mitigate the IL loss due to the rapid depeg.\\n \\n UST pools have had unforeseen volatility and due to sigificant full depeg risk, Osmosis users should have a chance to avoid further potential impermanent loss. This proposal gives liquidity providers in these pools the option to take an action to unpool their liquidity in these UST pools if they wish. Unpooling would be a new message action an LP can take on these pools if they were bonded before the emergency proposal time. Unpooling on a 14 day bond will be the equivalent of exiting the pool, and then beginning a 14 day unlock for the constituent assets. This has the affect of confirming any impermanent loss, and will safeguard one half of their remaining liquidity tokens in the event of an asset in the pair going to zero.\\n \\n Furthermore, by reducing the liqudity between OSMO and UST, it makes the UST->OSMO->ATOM a less liquid exit liquidity path for UST, helping reduce OSMO price impact during further UST depegs.\\n \\n Governance should be very cautious with this, as its a significant change to Osmosis and may set a dangerous precedent. The change is concerning on multiple fronts, including the fairness to other LP's, using a hard fork for something thats arguably a market design problem, and what is to be expected in the next crash.\\n \\n Because this process requires a software upgrade and is extremely time sensitive, we propose adding the execution of this to the same mechanism proposed in proposal #225.  Namely, once 2/3 of *total chain voting power* approves proposal #225, if within a short time period, 2/3 of total chain voting power also approves this proposal, then this signals the approval for validators to include functionality enabling depooling in the emergency hard fork.\\n \\n The list of pools affected is:\\n #560 (UST/OSMO)\\n #562 (UST/LUNA)\\n #567 (UST/EEUR)\\n #578 (UST/XKI)\\n #592 (UST/BTSG)\\n #610 (UST/CMDX)\\n #612 (UST/XPRT)\\n #615 (UST/LUM)\\n #642 (UST/UMEE)\\n #679 (4Pool)\\n \\n Note: This Proposal will consider to be passed based on 67\\% of governance voting Yes and failed based on 33\\% voting No and so will be eligible for action when this threshold has passed rather than at the end of the voting period.",false],["Remove Incentives from all Terra pools\n\nVoting YES for this proposal indicates that OSMO incentives should be removed from all Terra related pools and the fixed daily OSMO emissions reallocated to all other Incentivized pools. \\n\\n Voting NO for this proposal indicates that OSMO incentives on Terra pools will remain, and incentives naturally drain over time. \\n\\n Background \\n Due to the hyperinflation of LUNA supply caused by the recent UST depeg event, LUNA pools receive a far higher share of incentives than they should according to the current incentive model. \\n UST incentives will likely also excessive once the hard fork allows unpooling and liquidity falls, as well as when the first people unbonding begin to sell their UST into the pool. \\n As Osmosis incentives cannot be adjusted by more than 25% a week due to the Scaling Cap setting, the incentives on these pools may remain high for several months. This results in Osmosis paying for liquidity in these pools which is, at best, a highly speculative purchase based on any potential recovery model. At worst, users will buy in to obtain a high APR and be used as exit liquidity for people who have unbonded early. \\n While the existing incentives do compensate for Impermanent Loss to some extent, they do not differentiate between users who suffered this and users who bought in since. If this proposal passes, liquidity providers will have obtained 11 days of incentives since the crash.\\n The Osmosis emissions taken from the Terra pools will be distributed proportionately to all incentivised pools, giving all pools a boost of around a third of their APR\\n\\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/4878-urgent-remove-all-terra-related-incentives",false],["[Action Required] Signalling Proposal for Emergency v8 Upgrade at 4402000\n\nThis proposal is for coordination of the emergency height-gated hardfork upgrade to a v8 binary as already approved in proposals 225 and 226.

It has had pretty thorough testing on a testnet given the time constraints.\n\nAddendums to unpooling not specified in 226\n\nUnpooling of locks that are superfluid staked will not have slashing risk to avoid the large amount of code complexity implementing this would create and the time it would take to get implement it securely.\n\nAdditionally, it seems to have been the intention of prop 226 to include all UST pools, even though some were not included in the prop 226 text.

The v8.0.0 software version is fully state-compatible with v7.3.0 until the upgrade block 4402000, at which point they diverge.

After doing so, validators should vote yes on this proposal signalling that they have upgraded.\nFailure to do so will cause the node to crash – requiring a new node to be resynced, or restored to an earlier height with correct software version via snapshot.\n\nActionable(s)\nEvery node should upgrade their software version from v7.3.0 to v8.0.0 before the upgrade block height 4402000. If you use cosmovisor, just swap out the binary at upgrades/v7/bin to be v8.0.0, and restart the node. Do check that cosmovisor version says 8.0.0.\nUpon upgrading their setup and processing a block, every validator should vote yes on this proposal to signal readiness for the upgrade.)\nEvery node should check in at May 15th 2PM (14:00) UTC, and see if 2/3rds of validators have voted yes on the proposal. If so, no further action needed (unless they didn’t upgrade yet, in which case they should). If 2/3rds of the validator voting power has not signalled readiness by 2PM (14:00) UTC, then the upgrade is considered to have not reached agreement, and all nodes should revert their binary back to v7.3.0 until further notice.\nFurthermore, please review the numbers for the accelerated incentives updates in https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/1481/files#diff-cafe8a3f5831b68ac650982d09609c545f5990c6a1e6602ea4fb5c9bc04aa3bb, and v8 logic.\n\nFailure case and risks involved\n\nIn the case of critical failure where less than two-thirds of voting power updates their nodes, and over 1/3rd of voting power fails to downgrade according the plan, the new chain would fail to start.

That we overhaul the meta process for generation of adjustment proposals. This has historically been implemented through a series of google spreadsheets implementing each variant of the mechanism, with static copies made for the generation of each proposal. This shall be replaced with a Github repository based process, which will make public tracking of changes easier, and allow for (nearly) full automation of the proposal generation process.\\n\\n2. That we modify the current mechanism (bias, subsidy, matching, fee cap, etc) to first group pools into categories, each with a parameterized incentive share, and then pools within each category split that share based on their share of fees collected and external incentives.\\n\\n\\n## Github Repository\\n\\n[link to repo](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives/tree/unity/mainnet)\\n\\nThis Github repo will at all times contain at least 3 branches, which (along with some Github Action workflows), serve to automate the process of creating weekly adjustment proposals.\\n\\nThe `main` branch contains the process and data for the most recent proposal.\\n\\nThe `staging` branch contains the process for the next proposal.\\n\\nThroughout the week, PRs are made to `staging` corresponding to on chain text proposals, such as adding pools to onboarding, matching external incentives, or changing the adjustment process.\\n\\nA `liveview` branch off of staging is continually updated with new data, so that we can see what we expect the next proposal to look like.\\n\\nAs on chain text proposals pass, their PRs are merged to `staging` (and then merged to the `liveview` branch on the next update).\\n\\nWhen it is time for a new adjustment proposal, the `liveview` branch is merged back into `staging` (giving it up to date market data). And then `staging` branch is merged into `main`.\\n\\nThe data in the `main` branch is then used to create the on chain adjustment proposal.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Category Model\\n\\nThis model groups pools into a number of categories with proportional incentive shares, so that we can prioritize certain classes of liquidity directly.\\n\\n### Target Share\\nThe share of incentives allocated to each category is then split according to the proportion of swap fees collected by each pool within the category. These values are limited by the `swap fee cap` (currently 3), such that pools will not benefit by having more than 3x the average fee APR of the category.\\n\\nWe then recalculate shares using (capped) fees + external incentives collected by the pool. To limit the incentive increase caused by a match relative to the base incentives, we take the minimum of this `adjusted reveneue` share, and `(1 + matched_multiple_cap) * capped_fee_share`. We set `matched_multiple_cap` at 1, so set matches to be no more than the base incentives of a pool.\\n\\n### Major\\n\\nQualification for `Major` status is determined by governance based on a combination of factors, namely:\\n- Is the token market cap large relative to `Osmo`\\n- Does the majority of the trade volume happen outside of Osmosis\\n- Do we have a strategic interest in attracting more liquidity of this token\\n\\nThis proposal also entails choosing `ATOM`, `WETH`, `WBTC` and `CRO` as starting `Major` tokens. As well as `USDC`, `DAI`, and `EEUR` as stablecoins.\\n\\n### Minimum Share\\nPools can also have a minimum share set by governance, to incentivize liquidity ahead of observed trading volume. We set minimums of 25% of incentives on pools 1 and 5% on pools 674, 704, and 712 as demonstration and to guarantee a large amount of incentives for base liquidity. These parameters would be set and changed by governance and should be used to prioritize the growth of strategic liquidity.\\n### Categories\\n\\nThese initial category shares were chosen to approximately match the current breakdown of incentives between these groupings, but should be changed over time with follow up text proposals as needed.

Currently Osmosis will match all 15k of these external incentives in both pools.  The line that reads 'Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1' causes the FOO/ATOM pools to have 7.5k spent on matching compared to 15k on FOO/OSMO pools.\\n This is further limited if the fees generated are lower. In a scenario where both pools generate 5k per day in swap fees, currently, 5k of the 15k external incentives would be matched in both pools.  The line that reads 'Reduction in the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%' causes this 5k to be reduced to 1667 in matching on the FOO/ATOM pool.\\ni.e. to achieve full matching the pool would need to generate 45k in swap fees.\\nN.B. Example is weightings of fee allocation rather than actual figures.\\n\\n### Background\\nExternal Incentive matching was first established in [Proposal 47](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47) to incentivize their addition to Osmosis pools. This quickly grew into a major driver for incentive allocation following chains such as Stargaze, Chihuahua and Comdex adding large external incentives in comparison to the normal Osmosis incentive structure.\\nIn order to preserve incentives for established projects, without external incentives but important for the growth of Osmosis as the IBC decentralised exchange, governance voted in Proposals [128](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/128) and 133 to implement a bias factor around how fees were used to calculate external incentive matching as well as a cap on matched Osmosis incentives relative to un-matched Osmosis incentives\\nThe bias factor was defined as:\\n\\nThe same bias factor that is used for all incentivized pools within Osmosis. If the bias factor system (or equivalent preferential treatment for certain base asset) changes as time goes on, the external incentive matching should adapt in the same fashion.\\n\\nAt the time, this was a requirement of  equivalent of fees to be generated in a non-OSMO pool to provide the same matched incentives as  equivalent of fees in an OSMO pool as well as capping the match at up to 50% of the external incentive value.\\nProposal 233 reworked the incentive system to use a set of categories to allocate incentives to pools based on their component assets rather than a bias system and so there was no new preferential treatment system for the matching system to adapt to, causing all external incentives to be matched equally in all pools.\\nThis proposal asks that the previous matching biases be re-established in the new category model by:\\n* Reducing the efficacy of fees used to allocate the share of OSMO incentives used for matching external incentives to 33%\\n* Capping the value of OSMO used to match external incentives at 0.5:1\\n\\nCategories affected:\\n* Stable/Stable\\n* Major/Stable\\n* Other\\n\\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5767-external-incentive-matching-reduction-within-nonosmo-categories",false],["Signaling proposal: Create a osmosis bug bounty\n\n## Background\\nOn the 8th June 2022 at 02:49:55 UTC a major bug in the osmosis AMM has forced the validators to halt the network at block 4713064. The issue was that withdrawing funds from liquidity pools would result in getting assets worth more than what you had in the pool. This bug could've potentially drained the assets in all liquidity pools accross osmosis by simply adding liquidity and directly removing it again. Fortunately, the damage was limited to only 5 million dollars due to the fast reaction of the validators. However, apart from the financial damage, the 3-day shutdown also cost a lot of trust, which has to be earned again in the long term.\\n\\n## Bug Bounty/Vulnerability Disclosure Policy\\nTo prevent the malicious exploitation of such bugs I would like to propose two things:\\n1. **Creation of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**\\nThe goal of a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy is to encourage people to report bugs privately to the osmosis devs before making it public. Such policy would give information about how osmosis has to react to such bug reports and also give the reporting user the security to no being persecuted legally. I'll add some examples for such policy:\\n\\n    https://hackerone.com/riot?type=team\\n    https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/bug-fix-policy\\n    https://support.crowdin.com/vulnerability-policy/ \\n\\n2. **Creation of a according but bounty program**\\nHaving a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy usually also means having a bug bounty program to incentivise the reporting of such bugs instead of abusing them. The bounty paired with the legal security should then hopefully be enough to ensure critical bugs can be fixed before being disclosed to the public.\\nImmunefi is a platform where many crypto projects are running their bug bounty program (Polygon, MakeDAO, THORChain, PancakeSwap, etc.). Also Sifchain is having a bug bounty program there with rewards up to 2M$.\\nThis Bug Bounty should be funded by the strategic Osmo reserve and the community pool. Furthermore, core devs and external and independent actors should be involved in the bug bounty dao/team.\\n\\n\\n### Note\\nA bug bounty program doesn't mean that reported bugs are swept under the carpet. A vulnerability disclosure policy also includes when and how bugs can/will be disclosed to the public.\\n___\\nYES -> You aggree that a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure should be created and carried out. The creation itself with the exact policy will have to pass governance again.\\nNO -> You believe that's not neccessary and don't want a bug bounty and a vulnerability disclosure policy\\nNO WITH VETO -> You believe such policy/bug bounty would harm the network and want to prevent that at all cost",false],["\"Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-06-27\"\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\\n\"",false],["Continued reduction of emissions to Liquidity Pools\n\n* Voting Yes for this proposal indicates approval that 20% of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives should be redirected to the community pool to lower direct Osmosis inflation until governance returns it.\\n\\n* Voting No for this proposal indicates that 1% shall continue to be the proportion of Osmosis inflation allocated to Liquidity Incentives that is redirected to the community pool.\\n\\n### Background \\nOsmosis has been providing only 80% of the 45% (36%) of emissions to Liquidity Pools since Proposal 230.\\nThese have now returned to the liquidity incentives as stated in the original proposal.\\n\\nSince Proposal 230, Osmosis has continued to attract liquidity in major tokens despite these lowered incentives.

This overpayment contributes to the inflation of the Osmosis token and, if it is not required, then these tokens could be used either during the next hype period to attract new users, to pay for more teams to develop additional utilities for the Osmosis ecosystem or be used to provide incentives to other protocols building on Osmosis.\\n\\nIn the following model, we can see the estimated APR that a user would obtain if they were to stake the two separate halves of the liquidity pool on their own networks and how that compares with providing liquidity.  Where there is no alternative staking reward then OSMO staking APR is used as a substitute.\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1irSsCJbC7uGal8I5Eb0l2M2p6M7S20aUUkgfamK_zyg/edit?usp=sharing\\nThe estimated overspend by Osmosis LP incentives compared to these staking rewards is around 37%.\\n\\nSome overspending is sensible to attract OSMO compounding in the Major/Osmo category pools where Osmosis would like to build liquidity to gain market share.  However the overspending is not only directly contributing to the inflation of the OSMO token, it may also be increasing the sell pressure on tokens such as ATOM, where the optimal use of staking rewards is currently to sell single sided into Pool 1 rather than re-stake.\\n\\nThis proposal initially asks for the funds originally removed for Terra Pools to resume redirection to the community pool for the foreseeable future.  If this is successful and the rate of token liquidity change continues then further proposals will be made to reduce emissions to liquidity pools even further whilst still remaining the primary liquidity mining location in the IBC.\\n\\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5779-continued-reduction-of-emissions-to-liquidity-pools-during-the-bear-market",false],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/EVMOS\n\n* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/EVMOS (#722) pool on Osmosis.\\n\\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/EVMOS (#722) pool on Osmosis.\\n\\n**Details**\\nThis proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/EVMOS pool (#722).

This will give Osmosis governance built-in flexibility to act quickly in the case of emergencies.\\n\\n## Details\\nWith this feature enabled, a proposer can flag any proposal as Expedited when putting it on-chain.\\n\\nIf expedited, the deposit to enter voting period will be increased to 5000 OSMO. The proposal will have 24 hours to achieve a two-thirds majority of all staked OSMO voting power voting YES.\\n\\nIf it achieves that two-thirds majority within that time, it will be considered to have passed.\\n\\nIf it does not achieve the two-thirds majority within 24 hours, it will be converted to a normal proposal and run for the rest of the normal proposal period under normal rules. (If it is vetoed, even after having been converted to a normal proposal, the proposer will still lose the entire 5000 OSMO deposit.)\\n\\n## Implementation\\nThese changes will be effected by implementing the two Github repositories linked here. \\n\\n1) The original feature and spec can be found [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/240).\\n\\n2) Based on the feedback from Commonwealth, the functionality for configuring a separate, higher deposit [has been added](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/254). 5,000 OSMO (as above) will be the initial parameter.\\n\\n## Potential Parameter Changes for Future Governance \\nThe enlarged proposal deposit can of course be changed by a DAO vote. Likewise, further safety guards can and should be discussed in future threads and proposals. \\n\\nThese heightened safety guards might include requiring more than a two-thirds threshold to approve an emergency proposal, or they might require an additional delay, such as a longer-than-24-hour voting period for less acute emergencies. Further, governance could add a built-in implementation delay, during which voters could change their votes as the emergency evolved or as new information and perspectives came to light, particularly if it became apparent that the expedited proposal had been subject to a governance attack.\\n\\nCommonwealth Thread: https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/5035-governance-module-upgrade-twothirds-majority-emergency-voting-periods-24hr",false],["Match External Incentives on OSMO/EVMOS (#722)\n\n* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in matching EVMOS incentives on OSMO/EVMOS (#722)\\n\\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in matching external EVMOS incentives on OSMO/EVMOS (#722)\\n\\n## Details\\nThis is a signalling proposal to match external EVMOS incentives on OSMO/EVMOS (#722) as per the matching program guidelines established in Osmosis proposals 47, 128 and 133.\\nEvmos incentives are being proposed in [EVMOS Proposal 39](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/39) to the value of 600,000 EVMOS over a 90 day period, totalling a current value of ,242,000 or 3,800 per day.\\n\\n## About Evmos\\nEvmos is bringing the world of Ethereum-based applications and assets to the interoperable networks of the Cosmos ecosystem, all while aligning developer and user incentives.

Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis. It makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the STRD pool to the set of incentivized pools.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread**\n\nhttps://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/6904-signaling-proposal-to-incentivize-strides-strd-osmo-pool/",false],["Match External Incentives on OSMO/EVMOS (#722)\n\n* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in matching extended EVMOS incentives on OSMO/EVMOS (#722)\\n\\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in matching extended EVMOS incentives on OSMO/EVMOS (#722)\\n\\n## Details\\nThis is a signalling proposal to continue matching extended external EVMOS incentives on OSMO/EVMOS (#722) as per the matching program guidelines established in Osmosis proposals [47](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/47), [128](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/128) and [133](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/133).\\nEvmos Incentive matching was previously authorised in Osmosis [Proposal 279](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/279) for 90 days.\\nContinued Evmos incentives are being proposed in [EVMOS Proposal 70](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/70) to the value of 600,000 EVMOS over a 90 day period, totalling a current value of 18,000 or 0,200 per day, this proposal authorises matching this batch of incentives.\\n\\n## About Evmos\\nEvmos is bringing the world of Ethereum-based applications and assets to the interoperable networks of the Cosmos ecosystem, all while aligning developer and user incentives.

This mechanism allows only 2,000,000 net ROWAN to be sold every 24 hours, therefore increasing the stability of the ROWAN price on Sifchain. This cap was immediately hit and has led to a 4x price discrepancy between ROWAN on Sifchain and that transferred off.\\n\\nThis cap has effectively prevented a normal user from selling their ROWAN on Sifchain as the sale allowance per block is consumed by bots attempting to normalise the on and off-chain prices. If a user wishes to remove liquidity they must accept the loss regardless by exiting through other exchanges such as Osmosis.\\nConversely, a user entering ROWAN may purchase on Osmosis and move to Sifchain where they make a theoretical instant 4x profit that is un-redeemable at that value.\\n\\nThis results in almost all volume passing through Osmosis. Continued incentivisation in the face of this increased volume as users accept their losses or chase an un-redeemable gain will cause a greater and greater share of Osmosis Liquidity Incentives to be allocated to the pool, the liquidity to increase further, and any ROWAN token disparity require more days of arbitrage sales to rectify.\\n\\n**Commonwealth Thread:**[https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/7222-remove-incentives-from-osmorowan-629](https://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/7222-remove-incentives-from-osmorowan-629)",false],["Match External Incentives for GRAV incentivised pairs\n\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support for adding the following  pools to the OSMO incentive matching program.\\nBy voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding the following  pools to the OSMO incentive matching program.\\nWETH.grv/OSMO – Pool #634\\nUSDC.grv/OSMO – Pool #633\\nUSDT.grv/OSMO –Pool #818\\nGRAV/OSMO –Pool #625",false],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-10-24\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",false],["Signalling Proposal for LIKE/OSMO External Incentive Match\n\n# Signalling Proposal for LIKE/OSMO External Incentive Match\n\n\nThis is a proposal to match external incentives for Pool 553 - OSMO/ LIKE.

The reasoning for this is that the vast majority of OSMO liquidity is on Osmosis, making it difficult for new users to acquire elsewhere to carry out their first transaction. Allowing Osmosis users to submit transactions with a transaction fee of 0 has made it extremely easy for new users to onboard into Osmosis by enabling them to transact on Osmosis for the first time without having the native gas token. \\n\\nAt the same time, however, setting a minimum gas price of 0 leaves Osmosis vulnerable to denial of service attacks executed via the spamming of free transactions on the network. While thankfully Osmosis has not experienced a major DoS or DDoS event to date, incidences of recurring transaction spam have been increasing.\\n\\nWith a recent upgrade, Keplr now offers Osmosis users the ability to pay transaction fees on Osmosis in non-OSMO assets (for example, gas can now be paid in ATOM). While the ability to do this has existed on the Osmosis chain for quite some time, this wallet upgrade has opened the door to a large number of onboarding routes into Osmosis for all users on the main front-end for the very first time. Similarly, Osmosis’s Binance listing has made it much easier for new users to purchase OSMO off-chain to use as a transaction fee if necessary.\\n\\nAs such, the time is ripe to implement a minimum transaction fee on Osmosis. The purpose of this proposal is to signal to Osmosis Labs and other key Osmosis development contributors that governance mandates a minimum gas price of 0.0025 uOSMO be implemented at the protocol level. There is currently no governance adjustable parameter to implement this fee, so this proposal will be implemented in a subsequent software upgrade.\\n\\nFurther, to the extent that fees need to be priced via the Transaction Fee Module in another asset, the transaction fee module should be amended to utilize Osmosis Time Weighted Average Pricing over at least a 24 hour period instead of the currently utilized spot pricing to ensure that validators are fairly compensated no matter which asset is used for fees\\n\\nFull discussion on this proposal can be found here: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7009-signaling-proposal-implement-a-minimum-transaction-fee-on-osmosis-at-the-protocol-level)",false],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/AXL\n\n* By voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their support in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/AXL (#812) pool on Osmosis.\\n* By voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/AXL (#812) pool on Osmosis.\\n\\n**Details**\\nThis proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/AXL pool (#812).

The working group DOES NOT have the ability to revert any redirections that have occurred or change the amount that is to be redirected so that it does not equal the 7% defined in this proposal.

After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST.

The OSMO/IST pool should be listed as well in the main app.\\n\\n ## What is IST?\\n\\n IST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric’s unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric’s model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.\\n\\n For its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST.  Each PSM accepts another Cosmos stablecoin and mints IST in exchange.  There are currently four PSM contracts running, accepting USDC and USDT over both Axelar and Gravity bridges, each with different minting limits.  Rationale for the current minting limits was explained by the elected governance committee here: https://community.agoric.com/t/ist-minting-limits-for-inter-protocol-mvp-launch/87/1 \\n\\n Additional PSMs may be added by governance to accept new IBC-accessible stablecoins. \\n]\\n IST’s next iteration will include overcollateralized vaults, which will drive a major unlock for minting capability and allow the token to diversify away from bridge risk and stablecoin centralization risk.\\n\\n User Docs: https://docs.inter.trade/ \\n Analytics: https://analytics.inter.trade/ \\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/inter_protocol \\n Discord Link: https://discord.com/invite/interprotocol",false],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-11-21\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",false],["Revive IBC Client to Dig\n\nRevive IBC Client to Dig after expiration caused by chain halt",false],["Regular Incentive adjustment for 2022-11-28\n\n\"[Link to sheet displaying this proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydQfgEDot0AC9xuT2txc39VBfuum_I1gU_1-GrmrWx4/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to auto-updating sheet for upcoming proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEn8JtrIU1mze_3Fw4DbbxWBq6yPUM-yAoaOPxG6Y1k/edit?usp=sharing)\\n[Link to Github implementation of the adjustment process](https://github.com/OsmosisIncentivesCommittee/OsmoIncentives)\"",false],["Signaling Proposal for stOSMO/OSMO (#833) Incentivised Pool\n\n- By voting **YES** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their support for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.\n\n- By voting **NO** on this proposal OSMO stakers voice their dissent for adding stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives.\n\n**Details**\n\nThis is a signaling proposal to add stOSMO/OSMO (#833) to the set of pools that continuously receive OSMO incentives. This pool falls into the “minor/OSMO” incentive category, which receives 14% of OSMO incentives. So the stOSMO/OSMO pool would get part of that 14% of OSMO incentives. OSMO incentives to the set of pools that continuously receive incentives are adjusted weekly, using the semi-automatic incentive adjustment system.\n\nstOSMO/OSMO (#833) is currently incentivized with STRD from the Stride Foundation, at a rate of 10,000 STRD per day. The Stride Foundation will continue incentivizing this pool for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf approved, OSMO incentives to the stOSMO pool would increase liquidity depth, allowing the pool to function as a stable oracle for the price of stOSMO and absorb stOSMO liquidations. If liquidity is deep enough, stOSMO will likely be a collateral option for these coming Osmosis applications: Mars, Membrane, Margined, and Levana. In addition, many applications throughout the Cosmos will likely use stOSMO as collateral - if the stOSMO pool is deep enough.\n\n**About Stride**\n\nStride provides liquid staking for the Cosmos. Stride has a huge emphasis on security, with a minimalist blockchain, rate limiting, and continual auditing. Stride is working to build deep liquid staked derivative (LSD) liquidity on Osmosis, so that Stride LSD pools can function as oracles and absorb liquidations. As Stride is significantly aligned with Osmosis, it makes sense to further that alignment by voting to add the stOSMO pool to the set of incentivized pools.\n\n**Commonwealth Thread**\n\nhttps://gov.osmosis.zone/discussion/7482-signaling-proposal-to-incentivize-strides-stosmo-osmo-pool",false],["Osmosis v13 Fluorine upgrade proposal\n\nThis is a proposal to do a software upgrade to the v13.0.0 software tag of the Osmosis codebase on block height [7241500](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/blocks/7241500), which is estimated to occur on Thursday December 8th, UTC 15:00.

WYND DAO will deploy multichain DeFi protocols by using advanced CosmWasm contracts.\nTwenty-five percent of the fees generated with these protocols will go to an Environmental DAO investing in projects spearheading actions to improve the environment. Delegating WYND tokens will give you a voice in the future of this unique Cosmos project. Osmosis Stakers were among those able to claim the airdrop before the WYND DAO launch and so there is significant crossover between WYND and Osmosis community members.\nWebsite: [https://www.wynddao.com](https://www.wynddao.com)\n\nCommonwealth Thread: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9620-osmowynd-token-swap-for-protocol-liquidity](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9620-osmowynd-token-swap-for-protocol-liquidity)",false],["ProtoRev Revenue Allocation\n\nThis proposal indicates that the revenue captured by the ProtoRev module will be allowed to accumulate within a module address until at least the 1st June 2023\\nThis time will be used to gather data on the revenue accumulated and discuss ideas on how best to utilise it. After one month of reviewing proposals for recommended options, the community should make a decision on the direction of the ProtoRev account.\\n\\n# Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose of this proposal is to provide a recommendation around how Osmosis should initially handle the revenue generated by the ProtoRev module.\\n\\nOnce the ProtoRev module is implemented as part of the v15 upgrade, the community will need to decide how this revenue should be allocated. We recommend that Osmosis wait a minimum of 4 months and let the revenue accrue to a dedicated account controlled by governance. While it should be deployed to the benefit of Osmosis in the future, the community should wait until it has accumulated enough capital to make a material impact whenever it is deployed.\\n\\n# Background\\n\\n## ProtoRev Module Design Overview\\n\\nAs described in the governance forum post about the ProtoRev module, the module will check a set of possible arbitrage routes after every transaction and determine whether a back-running arbitrage opportunity was created by the transaction. The module will then:\\n* Determine the most profitable arbitrage opportunity and optimal trade size\\n* Leverage the Bank module to flash-loan itself the tokens required to perform the arbitrage trade\\n* Conduct the swaps for guaranteed profit\\n* Repay the loan by burning the flash-loaned assets\\n\\nThese transactions will take place after standard user transactions at the end of the block to rebalance the pools and capture the arbitrage profits. The revenue captured by the ProtoRev module will accrue to an account controlled by Osmosis governance. The ProtoRev module will conduct OSMO and ATOM settled arbs initially, so this account will hold a mix of OSMO and ATOM.\\n\\n## Benefits for Osmosis\\n\\nThe ProtoRev module is a groundbreaking innovation for AMMs and stands to improve the economic sustainability and UX for Osmosis:\\n\\n**Economic Sustainability**\\nThe ability to capture in-protocol MEV as protocol revenue is one of the largest competitive advantages that Osmosis has over DEX’s built on monolithic chains. These other AMM applications are limited to rent-seeking forms of revenue generation (e.g. Uniswap’s fee switch) because all MEV accrues directly to validators. That’s not to say that Osmosis should not implement a take rate on trading fees, but rather that it’s unlikely to be sustainable as the only form of protocol revenue.\\n\\nWe have already begun to see compression of DEX fees as evidenced by the introduction of Uniswap’s 5bps and 1bp fee tiers. We have also seen this dynamic play out with traditional exchanges, as Robinhood was able to capture huge amounts of market share from incumbents (e.g. Fidelity, Schwab) by removing trading fees. As more DEXs enter the Cosmos ecosystem, the ability to undercut fees will serve as a strong competitor differentiator for Osmosis. By allowing Osmosis to capture a more sustainable revenue stream in the form of benign MEV, the ProtoRev module greatly improves Osmosis’s positioning as the space becomes more competitive.\\n\\n**Protocol Health**\\nIn addition to capturing protocol revenue that would otherwise be lost to searchers, the ProtoRev module will also improve the UX of Osmosis. Current arbitrage systems run intermittently, allowing price differentials to remain in place for multiple blocks. The ProtoRev module will keep asset prices even across pools for every trade by running cyclical arbitrage at the end of each block to rebalance the pools.\\n\\n# Revenue Projections\\n\\nFrom October 1 to December 31st, there has been $176,637.97 extracted from Osmosis liquidity pools in the form of arbitrage transactions. This translates to approximately $1,941 per day. [(Source)](https://satellite.skip.money/)\\n\\nAs can be seen from the below charts from this period, this extraction varies hugely depending on the market conditions which trigger these transactions during periods of high volatility.\\n$30,737 (17.6%) of this MEV was extracted over the two days of October 27th, 2022 to October 28th 2022 (Binance Listing)\\n\\nThe FTX collapse caused significantly higher volatility and so higher MEV extraction during the second week of November 2022.\\n\\nDecember 10th 2022 has a spike in price caused by manipulation on Binance due to closed withdrawals/deposits. [(Source)](https://t.ly/llXI)\\n\\n[USD Captured as MEV on Osmosis 3rd October 2022 - 31st December 2022](https://t.ly/HWk1)\\n\\n[Price and Volume chart of OSMO in the same period, showing alignment of volatile periods with increase in MEV.](https://t.ly/cvGZ)\\n\\nDuring a stable bear market, excluding these spikes, we may expect MEV to reach $1,368 per day, of which an estimated 70-80% will be recovered by the ProtoRev module.\\n\\nFor comparison purposes, during the last bull market, for February 1st 2022 - April 31st 2021, cumulative MEV collected was $1,821,199, or $20,462 per day. This shows that the potential return from the ProtoRev module in arbitrage alone may be a significant part of protocol income in the future. Especially with the addition of links to many more chains since this period than existed on Osmosis at the time, allowing for more opportunities for arbitrage between routes to occur.\\n\\n# Recommendation\\n\\nAs the bear market rages on, we want to ensure the MEV revenue generated by the ProtoRev module is utilized in a manner which maximizes its benefits to the Osmosis community. The Osmosis Community Pool at the time of this writing currently holds 63.22M OSMO tokens. This is expected to grow at an accelerated rate as we continue to shift incentives which were previously allocated to incentivizing liquidity pools.\\n\\nTo this end, MEV revenue should be deployed at times when the contributions can be meaningful in size to the protocol. As discussed, on average we may expect MEV to reach ~$1300 per day which we can expect the ProtoRev module to recover the majority of.\\n\\nAlthough this creates a positive value accrual mechanism for the Osmosis community, the amounts being generated would not be significant if added to the community pool which currently is receiving 60% of the liquidity incentives. Allowing this revenue to be directed to the community pool would fail to maximize the benefits to the traders, liquidity providers and stakers of Osmosis.\\n\\nIn the current market conditions, directing this revenue to stakers would not move the needle in terms of value accrual to OSMO. By our estimates, stakers would only see a 0.8% increase in staking yield (e.g. 23.28% to 23.46%) if they were to receive 100% of the ProtoRev module’s revenue. Since Skip will receive 20% of the revenue in Year 1 (as part of the [community approved payment schedule](https://t.ly/EG3f), stakers would only see 0.14% added to their APR. While the community should consider this option in the future as the emission schedule winds down, or if MEV revenue increases, there are likely more impactful ways to deploy this capital in the near term.\\n\\nAs such, we are proposing the revenue generated from MEV is collected, until the funds can grow to have a meaningful impact towards benefiting the community. We believe it is in the best interest of the community to collect the revenue in an account controlled by governance. Over the next four months, community members should submit proposals with their recommendation on how best to deploy these funds. The community can then vote on the potential options to distribute this revenue. We recommend that the community should conduct reviews on a quarterly basis to evaluate the ongoing impact of deployed capital. Based on the results, adjustments can be made as needed to ensure this protocol income is utilized effectively and proportionately.\\n\\nBelow are some ideas on how we could deploy MEV revenue in the future:\\n\\n**UX Benefits**\\n* Subsidization of swap fees, gas fees, or bridge / on-ramping fees\\n\\n**Supplementing / Replacing Costs**\\n* Supplement LP yield for high priority (e.g. Superfluid Staking) or under-incentivised pools\\n* Supplement staking yield\\n\\n**Other**\\n* Funding growth initiatives or loyalty programs\\n* Insurance pool\\n* Building a stablecoin reserve\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nThis proposal would allow the revenue captured by the ProtoRev module to accumulate within a module address. This will allow the community to assess the amount of typical value captured by the module as well as forming a reserve of capital. Accumulating a larger reserve will enable this capital to have a more meaningful impact when it is ultimately deployed.\\n\\nThis Revenue Reserve would be assessed no earlier than 1st June 2023. After reviewing proposals for recommended options, the community should make a decision on the direction of the ProtoRev account.\\n\\n# Additional Note\\nWhile all options should be evaluated during the research phase, we believe that the community pool or DAOs with authorised spends are likely more appropriate sources of funding for any use case that would involve discrete, one-off spend. Unlike the community pool, the ProtoRev account address does not need consent from governance for each deployment of assets to every contract authorised by governance to be able to draw on funding. This enables more flexibility to create an approach that optimizes the streaming of funds to maximize impact. This post included a few potential options, but we welcome community members to put forth any ideas with supporting analysis and engage in discussion over the next 4 months.\\n\\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9615-protorev-revenue-allocation-proposal](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9615-protorev-revenue-allocation-proposal)",false],["Update IBC Client for Cerberus - 2nd time\n\nThe Cerberus chain spent 1.5 weeks in halt due to the upcoming Dragonberry patch.

These cause Liquidity Providers to pay a fee when withdrawing from the pool. Users withdraw their tokens, minus a proportion of the LP shares, for the exit fee. These LP shares are burned, resulting in pro-rata distribution to remaining LPs.\\n\\nAs a method of retaining liquidity their usefulness is questionable. A liquidity provider who wishes to leave the pool will likely regard a small 0.1% fee as negligible compared to their reasoning for leaving, such as migration to another pool or confirming their current ratio of assets.\\n\\nA larger fee may be better at retaining liquidity, however, these begin to prevent users from leaving the pool without sacrificing earned rewards and therefore increase the hurdle for users to overcome the sunk cost fallacy on declining pools.\\n\\nCurrently there is no display of the exit fee on the [Osmosis.zone](http://Osmosis.zone) frontend and so a user may not be aware of this fee when joining a pool, therefore being unable to estimate the time they must provide liquidity for before their returns outweigh the exit fee.

After a week-long soft launch, the IST minting limits have been increased to 5m total IST. IST liquidity will be incentivized through the Cosmos ecosystem, with Osmosis being a critical early destination.\nThe authors believe that it would be in the best interests of the community to incentivize an OSMO-IST pool to drive deep eventual liquidity and easy access from any other Osmosis token.\n\n### What is IST?\nIST aims to be the premier decentralized stabletoken in the Cosmos ecosystem and eventually beyond. Inter Protocol is the first set of contracts launched on the Agoric blockchain using Agoric’s unique smart contract framework and Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol. Agoric’s model allows IST to expand contracts with IST minting capability easily, with fine-grained governance of key risk parameters such as minting limits. IST therefore has the ability to expand to a risk-weighted collection of stablecoin mechanisms and collateral.\n\nFor its MVP launch, IST prioritized peg stability and therefore launched the Parity Stability Module (PSM) contract as the first minting contract for IST.

There are stable assets that are still pegged to fiat currencies, but are backed by on-chain cryptocurrencies instead of off-chain regulated fiat assets.\nThroughout this proposal the distinction between the two are defined as:  \n\n**Stablecoin** - (1) A cryptocurrency designed to maintain parity with another asset, usually an off-chain asset or fiat currency, such as US Dollar.  (2) Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value, unlike most other cryptocurrencies which are known for their volatility. This is achieved by pegging the value of the stablecoin to a stable asset, such as the US dollar. This makes stablecoins useful for transactions and payments, as they provide the benefits of cryptocurrencies (such as fast, secure, and borderless transactions) without the volatility that can make other cryptocurrencies difficult to use as a reliable store of value.\n\n**Stabletoken** - A class of stablecoins that are backed with primarily on-chain cryptocurrency assets rather than off-chain assets.\n\nThe use of Stabletoken is encouraged to differentiate between stable currencies that are backed by off-chain regulated  assets vs on-chain assets.\n\nProposal 233 defined Stablecoins (and therefore the class Stabletokens)  as an asset type to be used in the incentive category structure. Assets defined as Stablecoins/Stabletokens are currently eligible for:\n\nAccess to the Osmo/Stable Category for their incentivized pools\nAccess to the Stable/Stable Category for their incentivized pools\nAutomatic matching of External incentives within the Stable/Stable Category as per Proposal 377 \n\nPart 1 of this proposal established IST as a Stablecoin/Stabletoken asset on Osmosis.\n\n### Voting\n* By voting YES on this proposal, IST will be recognized on Osmosis as a Stabletoken.\n* By voting NO on this proposal, IST's status will remain unchanged\n\n**About IST**  \nIST is currently the largest native Cosmos circulating Stabletoken with over $1.8M minted.\nIt is currently mintable via the Inter Protocol parity stability module from USDC, USDT or DAI and will be mintable later this year from volatile assets, such as ATOM.  Exchanges that list IST include Crescent and Osmosis with more coming online every monthly.  As a native Cosmos Stabletoken, it is not a bridged asset and once minted on the Agoric chain, can be used by any and all of the IBC zones.\n\nWebsite: https://inter.trade/\n\n## Part 2: Enable OSMO incentive for core StableSwap pool DAI / CMST / IST\nPart 2 of this proposal recognzes the StableSwap 3 pool of DAI / CMST / IST as a core StableSwap pool and enables OSMO incentives at the next routine incentives proposal.\nThis is a signaling proposal to include the StableSwap 4 pool DAI / CMST / IST into the set of pools that receive OSMO liquidity incentives by recognising it as a core StableSwap pool.\nAfter this proposal has passed governance, the pool will be added to the regular incentives program of OSMO and receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool. \nThe pool incentivised at this time would be Pool 908 with IST & CMST being native Cosmos stable tokens and DAI & USDC provided via the Axelar bridge and as such are the canonical representations of these on Osmosis according to Proposal 206. \nIf the canonical status of one of these assets is changed then incentives would move at the next routine proposal to the pool containing the new canonical assets, with the highest volume and matching the criteria stated in Proposal 377.\nStable pools are incentivised by the model defined in Proposal 377. In brief, incentivised pools receive a subsidy of up to 2 times the value of fees generated in the pool in OSMO, with the total of the Stable/Stable category being capped as 4% of current Liquidity Provider emissions.\n\n### Voting\n* By voting YES on this proposal, the Stable Swap 3 pool of DAI / CMST / IST will be added to the regular incentives program of OSMO and receive incentives as a Stable/Stable pool. \n* By voting NO on this proposal, the pool will not be incentivized.\n\n\n**About DAI**  \nDAI is a Stablecoin cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain generated by MakerDAO.

Summary\n\nBabylon proposes a 3-phase integration to allow Osmosis to leverage the security  of the Bitcoin network and enjoy benefits such as fast stake unbonding and extra security for high-valued transactions. This signaling proposal serves a dual purpose: it not only signals the Osmosis community's intent to integrate phase 1 shortly after Babylon mainnet, but also provides a clear roadmap for the integration process. Phases 2 and 3 will be specified and voted for by the community in future governance proposals.\n\nCommonWealth forum post: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/9967-babylon-integration-proposal-with-osmosis\n\nWe have created an FAQ based on the feedback we received from the community which can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1NmMZZTtWPJRWJXwPtAWIykAPDmPaZx4OgyL8fS2ik/edit?usp=sharing\n\n1. Overview\n\nThe Babylon project allows PoS chains to leverage Bitcoin security. Babylon uses Bitcoin to timestamp critical PoS consensus data (such as headers with quorum certificate). This secure timestamping resolves a fundamental security threat to PoS chains that allows attackers to fork the chain without being slashed, known as the long-range attack.\nBut Babylon doesn’t just protect against long-range attacks. The same secure timestamping also improves the security dynamics for Cosmos PoS chains. To name a few: It allows for a shorter unbonding period without impacting the PoS chain’s security. It allows Osmosis clients to enjoy additional security for important high-valued transactions. It also allows for easier state sync and snapshot verification for node operators. It can also help with the IBC client initialization and verification, which is particularly important for Osmosis. \n\n2. Additional Context\n\nBabylon has conducted several events around Bitcoin security for Cosmos with Osmosis and Juno among others. There has been strong Cosmos community support for these efforts with 150+ people signing up for these events. Sunny from Osmosis has spoken at these events with great community receptivity from both the Babylon and Osmosis communities.\n3. Summary of the Three Phases of Integration\nBabylon proposes a 3-phase integration to allow Osmosis to leverage the security and availability of the Bitcoin network. At its core, Babylon verifies Osmosis’ critical consensus data (called checkpoints) submitted by IBC relayers and aggregates the checkpoints for secure Bitcoin timestamps.\nThe table below summarizes the integration phases. In particular, Phase-1 integration is permissionless, since it only involves a standard IBC connection without any code changes to Osmosis. Yet it can already unlock Bitcoin security for Osmosis. All the integrations will be thoroughly reviewed and tested on Osmosis testnet first. Separate governance proposals will be submitted for mainnet integrations.\n\nThree Phase Table\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF2xpu0reAbBHfNz4dult8DrPux-mnTZx3qP9SWQsug/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe Babylon integration will not impact the infrastructure and operations of Osmosis validators and relayers. It will provide extra information and tools that help them secure the network. \n\n\n4. More Details about the Integrations \n\nPhase-1: The Oracle\n\nIBC relayer’s client sync functionality will automatically submit Osmosis’ signed headers to Babylon. These headers will enter the Babylon ledger and be verified, and will receive secure BTC timestamps. Then any Babylon node can serve as an oracle for queries about:\nthe BTC-finalized Osmosis headers\nwhether there were long-range attacks to Osmosis\nThis information provides objective trusted heights and headers that allow Osmosis node operators (such as validators) and IBC relayer operators to bootstrap and verify Osmosis full nodes, light clients, and snapshots. It also allows Osmosis’ counterparty chains to verify their Osmosis IBC client.\nBelow is an example API call to a Babylon node for the query: \n>> https://<ip>:<port>/babylon/zoneconcierge/v1/finalized_chain_info/{chain_id} \nThe Babylon team will also maintain an API server and web service for better visualization and usability. For example, Babylon’s web service can display real-time updates of the partner chain’s latest information.\nThe Babylon team will also provide additional standalone tools to verify the correctness of any Babylon nodes. \nPhase-2: On-Chain Automation\nThe Babylon team will work with the community to design and develop an IBC application module that handles BTC timestamps and associated proofs sent by Babylon. Osmosis will import this module to its App struct. The module will work standalone and thus will not require changes to other codes, nor impact existing functionalities.\nCompared to Phase-1 where Osmosis users will need to access Babylon oracle nodes for Osmosis’ BTC timestamp information, this phase will enable the following on-chain automation:\nautomatically decide the latest headers finalized by BTC \nautomatically detect and alert any forking attacks on partner chain observed by Babylon\nThis phase will also be an enabler of Phase-3 integration, which utilizes the on-chain BTC timestamp information.\n\nOsmosis x Babylon Genesis swap\n\nIn order to foster a sense of cohesion and shared purpose between our communities, Babylon will be implementing a strategic initiative during Phase 2 of our project. As part of this initiative, we will be requesting token swap. These funds will be added to Babylon's community pool and will be utilized to support the growth and development of the Babylon partnership with Osmosis.\n\nKey components of this initiative will be the delegation and staking of the acquired OSMO and bootstrapping liquidity pools. This will not only help to secure the network and support the underlying blockchain, but will also provide a way for Osmosis to actively participate in the growth and success of Babylon. By ensuring that the genesis swap is being used to support both ecosystems, we believe that we can effectively promote alignment and a sense of shared ownership among our communities.\n\nOverall, this initiative is a crucial step towards building a strong and united partnership, and we are confident that it will play a key role in the long-term success of Babylon and integrations of bitcoin security on Osmosis. Details of the genesis swap will be included in a future prop (phase2).\n\nBABYLON/OSMO liquidity bootstrapping pool on Osmosis\nBabylon available on Osmosis\nAligned success for both communities \nDiversify both babylon and Osmosis community pool \n\nPhase-3: Unbonding Time Reduction \n\nThe Babylon team and Osmosis team will work together to hook Osmosis’ staking module with the IBC application module imported in Phase-2. The stake unbonding/undelegating request approval conditions will be updated to include the associated Osmosis block’s BTC finalization information provided by the IBC application module.\nThe BTC finalization time will be a configurable parameter. It enables a configurable stake unbonding time that can be as short as 15-30 hours, which is much shorter than the current 14 days.\n(The Babylon team is also researching other use cases of BTC security with the community.)\n5. Pro's of this Proposal\nBetter security for Osmosis \nOsmosis will become BTC secured with BTC-assisted node / light client bootstrapping and verification enabled, which is particularly useful for Osmosis validator and relayer operators\nOptionally, much shorter unbonding time (as short as 15-30 hours, and is configurable by Osmosis) may increase the number of Osmosis community members (especially OSMO stakers such as validators and delegators) because it gives them higher liquidity and can also significantly reduce the “idle” capital that does not earn yield due to the unbonding period.\nBabylon community will engage with Osmosis, increasing usage, community engagement and TVL\nMore institutional players may engage with Osmosis due to increased security of the chain through the Babylon integration increasing TVL\nThe integration will increase censorship resistance of Cosmos zones including Osmosis\n6. Cons of this Proposal\nHaving a steady stream of IBC transactions will somewhat increase the size of osmosis blocks. The additional size per Osmosis block will be in the order of the Osmosis header size.\nThere will be additional development and relaying commitment, but Babylon is partnered with Cosmos’ leading relayers.\n\n\nVoting\nBy voting YES on this proposal, OSMO stakers to show their intent for integrating phase 1 upon Babylon’s mainnet launch and signal support for the direction of Phase 2-3 integrations\n\nBy voting NO on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice their dissent in enabling Phase 1 integration or do not support the direction of Phase 2-3 integration.\n\nBy voting ABSTAIN on this proposal, OSMO stakers voice no strong opinion on the matter.\n\nBy voting NOWITHVETO on this proposal, OSMO stakers contribute to a 1/3rd threshold that will cause this proposal to fail, and the deposit to be burned.\n",false],["Osmosis Proposal Standards\n\nThis proposal intends to supersede [Proposal 199](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/199) by defining a set of standards for putting a proposal into voting period on Osmosis.\\n\\nProposals that have not met these criteria should be met with `NoWithVeto`.\\n\\n# Standards\\nGovernance proposals must be posted as a draft on Commonwealth for at least three days before being submitted to chain to allow feedback.\\n\\n## CosmWasm Storecode Proposals\\n*`wasm-store`, `migrate-contract`* \\n\\nCosmWasm StoreCode Proposals must contain the following information at minimum:\\n* Git Commit ID or release\\n* Version of Compiler used\\n* A description of the code's purpose for a layman\\n\\nStoreCode Proposals must be posted with full text and links to the code to be deployed for a minimum of 7 days before being submitted to chain to allow deeper review.\\n\\n# Exemptions\\n## Expedited Proposals\\n*Proposals Utilising the `--expedited` flag implemented in V12* \\n\\nAny proposal utilising the Expedited status as defined in [Proposal 278](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/278) is exempt from this requirement.\\nUse of this mechanism for non-urgent situations should be met with `NoWithVeto`.\\nUrgent situations must be clearly communicated as such with a corresponding Commonwealth post.\\n\\n## Software and IBC Updates\\n*Currently `software-upgrade`, `cancel-software-upgrade`, `ibc-upgrade`, `update-client` commands* \\n\\nSoftware and IBC updates are not required to be posted for review. \\nThe coordination of Software Upgrade proposals is typically carried out in more direct channels between Developers and Validators and may be subject to sudden changes in scheduling. \\nIBC Maintenance proposals are required when an IBC channel has become stale due to lack of use.

Being fully governed by HARBOR holders, and backed by a large range of decentralised assets like ATOM and OSMO, CMST is positioned to be the prime stabletoken for the interchain DeFi ecosystem. \\n Website: [https://harborprotocol.one/](https://harborprotocol.one/). - By voting Yes, you agree to amend the upgrades proposed. \\n - By voting No, you do not agree to amend the upgrades proposed. \\n - Vote ABSTAIN if you don't have a strong opinion about the proposal. \\n - Vote NO WITH VETO if you think this proposal is harming the network and the depositor should be slashed for submitting it.",false],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/AVAX\n\nOn passing, this proposal would enable Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/(w)AVAX (#899) pool on Osmosis. \\n\\n## Details**\\nSuperfluid proposals ask whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance. \\n\\nThis proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/(w)AVAX pool (#899). \\n\\nIf enabled at the current 50% discount rate, an additional ~70 thousand OSMO can be used to secure the network through staking.\\n\\nThis proposal comes after the bootstrapping period for AVAX implemented in [Proposal 410](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/410) has ended.\\n\\n## About AVAX\\nAVAX is the native token of the Avalanche platform and is used to secure the network through staking, pay for fees, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple subnetworks created on the Avalanche platform. wAVAX is the wrapped version of AVAX that enables use on the Avalanche network. \\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.avax.network](https://www.avax.network)\\n\\n\n **Commonwealth Thread**: [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10090-enable-superfluid-staking-on-osmoavax](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10090-enable-superfluid-staking-on-osmoavax)",false],["Composability Incentives Category\n\nThis proposal would add Osmosis Liquidity Incentives to pools essential for bridging composability on Osmosis. \\n\\n## Category Details\\nThe composability category is intended to provide small, fixed incentives to stableswap pools between identical assets with differing sources in order to facilitate trading on Osmosis through the deeper canonical asset pools, regardless of the origin of these assets. \\n\\nAs a category that operates in the background, pools added to this category will not be expected to be added to the main [Osmosis.zone](http://Osmosis.zone) frontend. \\n\\n## Initial Pools\\nInitial pools included in this category would be: \\n* [USDC.axl/USDC.grv](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/872)\\n* [USDT.axl/USDC.grv](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/873)\\n* [USDC.axl/polygon.USDC.axl/avalanche.USDC.axl](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/pool/938)\\n\\n## Establishing Targets\\nBased on typical trading volumes in the current USDC.grv/OSMO and USDT.grv/OSMO pools [require approximately](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/osmosis/incentives-optimization) $95k and $130k of liquidity respectively to facilitate trading to and from Gravity Bridge. As the intended composability pools are StableSwaps they are far more efficient than Balancer pools at providing the same function and so require approximately 3x less liquidity to facilitate trades at the same slippage. \\n\\nConversely, with the lower levels of swap fees in these pools a much lower slippage should also be targeted. Converting the 0.2% swap fees to 0.04% results in a proportional target of 0.2% slippage. \\n\\nWe can therefore target specific liquidity for slippage levels. This is calculated in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UcfBmnf8ZKOWBaqOim5yx2kTDWmE5Vy00NwqnbShPzU/edit#gid=0) and results in $45k of liquidity in a pair being required to cater for OSMO/USDC.grv trades and $62k to cater for OSMO/USDT.grv trades if they were StableSwap pools. This may be excessive as the APR from external Gravity incentives provided in [Proposal 347](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/347) makes these pools attractive and there will be activity from people wanting to join for the rewards rather than using them as a way to utilise Gravity Bridge. A baseline of $45k liquidity from incentives alone will therefore be established. \\n\\nNow the target Liquidity is established we need to identify an attractive APR for this liquidity level. Comparing alternative stable/stable pools across the Interchain shows that typical yields range from 12% to 28% APR. As additional fees will be generated from swap fees, 12% will be set as a reasonable baseline reward rate. \\n\\n## Rent vs Buy\\nAs the total OSMO spend on incentives is relatively small at the intended liquidity targets, acquiring this liquidity through incentives in the more cost-effective option for approximately 5.5 years before purchasing the liquidity outright became a preferable option. As cross-chain bridging routes are still being established and may be subject to change with the release of native USDC on the Interchain, renting through incentivisation is also the more flexible option. \\n\\n## Requested Incentives\\nBringing these together, to establish $45k liquidity earning 12% APR OSMO rewards requires a target of ~15 OSMO a day, which is a minimum incentive setting of 0.0062% per pool, resulting in around 0.02% of actual emissions going to each pool. \\n\\nThe USDC 3pool requires 1.5 the liquidity and spend of a pair and so needs an emission setting of 0.0093%, resulting in around 0.03% of actual emissions going to this pool. \\n\\nThis proposal asks that this be set as a fixed level of incentives for every pool added to the composability category to provide functional liquidity for bridge composability. These incentive levels would be set after this proposal and remain in place unless revised by a future governance proposal. \\n\\n**Commonwealth Thread:** [https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10057-composability-incentives-category](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/10057-composability-incentives-category)",false],["Enable Superfluid Staking on OSMO/DOT\n\nOn passing, this proposal would enable Superfluid Staking on the OSMO/DOT (#773) pool on Osmosis. \\n\\n## Details\\nThis proposal would enable Superfluid Staking in the OSMO/DOT pool (#773). \\n\\nIf enabled at the current 50% discount rate, an additional ~156 thousand OSMO can be used to secure the network through staking. \\n\\nThis proposal asks whether governance trusts in the stability and security of the chain sufficiently to allow their tokens to have an influence on Osmosis governance. \\n\\n## About Polkadot\\nThis version of DOT is provided via Axelar and Moonbeam was voted to be the current canonical bridge in Osmosis Proposal 249. \\n\\nDOT is the Moonbeam-wrapped version of Polkadot and requires unwrapping on the Moonbeam network from xcDOT after passing through the Axelar bridge to become native DOT. \\n\\nPolkadot unites and secures a growing ecosystem of specialized blockchains called parachains.

Passing this proposal will remove OSMO incentives at the next routine incentive proposal. \\n\\n## Details\\nOsmosis Governance recently removed incentives from EEUR in the light of the winddown of the stablecoin by the E-money team: [https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/397](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/397) \\n\\nNGM/OSMO retained incentives from Osmosis as the [original statement from E-money](https://medium.com/e-money-com/eeur-stablecoin-unwind-cf945820fb3f) indicated that the chain would be pursuing other use cases. \\n\\nOver the last few weeks, multiple NGM pairings have been created with heavy incentivisation of NGM. \\n\\nThis is part of a new strategy by the e-Money team to achieve the following goals: \\n* Create multiple pools against major tokens to reduce exposure to a single asset (OSMO). \\n* Join the pools using Treasury tokens programmatically and in a controlled fashion to not adversely impact prices. \\n* Deploy genesis LP allocation of NGM to incentivise participation by 3rd parties. \\n\\nThis is further detailed in this article: [https://medium.com/e-money-com/unwinding-eeur-issuance-and-boosting-ngm-liquidity-d66489b2a62](https://medium.com/e-money-com/unwinding-eeur-issuance-and-boosting-ngm-liquidity-d66489b2a62) \\n\\nThe pool has had suitable liquidity for normal trading purposes up to this point and will likely grow further with the addition of these high incentives. The share of OSMO incentives this pool receives will also likely grow as there will be a sustained increase in trading volume from liquidity providers purchasing NGM from the NGM/OSMO pool to join the new pools as well as from the programmatic joining of the pool with single sided NGM to establish the team’s own liquidity. \\n\\nAs Osmosis governance originally incentivised NGM/OSMO as a governance token of a chain with EEUR as its flagship product the Osmosis incentives should also be re-evaluated in line with this new strategy. \\n\\nThis proposer believes it is in the best interest of Osmosis to remove incentives from the NGM pool for the moment until these pools settle and a course is confirmed for NGM. \\n\\nSee the Commonwealth thread for the full discussion. \\n\\n **Commonwealth
