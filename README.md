# rust-bert-fraud-detection
Robust semi-supervised fraud detection using Rust native NLP pipelines.
# About
**rust-bert-fraud-detection** uses the NLP pipelines from [rust-bert](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-bert) to extract **[topic predictions](https://github.com/Philipp-Sc/rust-bert-fraud-detection/blob/main/package/src/build/mod.rs)** (fraud indicators) via zero shot classification, **text embeddings** and **sentiment** from the given text. This data is then used to predict the fraud likelihood.

The training data is generated from a diverse collection of commonly used spam/ham datasets:
- Ling Spam,
- Enron Spam,
- Spam Assassin Dataset,
- SMS Spam Collection,
- Youtube Spam,
- Crypto Governance Proposals.

Since the model is trained only on latent features and NOT on a text encoding (such as Bag of Words) less datapoints are needed to build a general and robust model which works great accross different domains (e.g emails, websites and governance proposals) because the actuall text processing is done by the language model.


# Use

Add to your `Cargo.toml` manifest:

```ini
[dependencies]
rust_fraud_detection_tools = { git="https://github.com/Philipp-Sc/rust-bert-fraud-detection.git" }
``` 
Predict fraud/ham:
```rust

pub const SENTENCES: [&str;6] = [
    "Lose up to 19% weight. Special promotion on our new weightloss.",
    "Hi Bob, can you send me your machine learning homework?",
    "Don't forget our special promotion: -30% on men shoes, only today!",
    "Hi Bob, don't forget our meeting today at 4pm.",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL: LAST TERRA PHOENIX AIRDROP üåé ‚úÖ CLAIM NOW All participants in this vote will receive a reward..",
    "Social KYC oracle (TYC)  PFC is asking for 20k Luna to build a social KYC protocol.."
    ];


fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {

    let fraud_probabilities: Vec<f64> = rust_fraud_detection_tools::fraud_probabilities(&SENTENCES)?;
    println!("Predictions:\n{:?}",fraud_probabilities);
    println!("Labels:\n[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]");
    Ok(())
}

# Architecture

## Models
The fraud detection consists of a Random Forest Regressor and a set of predictors whose predictions are provided to the model:

### ~~1. Naive Bayes~~
Naive Bayes classifier are well known for their effectiveness in text related tasks especially spam detection.  

Two Naive Bayes classifiers have been trained on a Bag of Words representation of the spam/ham datasets.
- [Categorical Naive Bayes classifier](https://docs.rs/smartcore/latest/smartcore/naive_bayes/categorical/struct.CategoricalNB.html) **(F-Score = 0.870)** 
- [Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier](https://docs.rs/crate/linfa-bayes/latest) **(F-Score = 0.859)**


### ~~2. Neural Net~~
Performs equally as well as the Random Forest, both have different strenghts and weaknesses.

<summary> <b>Expand to display the feature importance breakdown </b> </summary>

Permutation feature importance:

- 0.005730121457193: Categorical Naive Bayes classifier  
- 0.007951363662145: Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier

- **0.571354464392836: KNN Regressor** ‚≠ê

Adding the KNN Regressor resulted in a few changes:
- The Neural Network now has very little to no influence on the final prediction.
- The Naive Bayes classifier have lost their usefulness.

This allows us to simplify the model and discard the models from 1-3 while keeping the model unaffected.

## Features

### Topic Predictions
Topic predictions (fraud indicators) via zero shot classification using the BERT language model were generated, note that his is quite compute intensive.
The language models used by [rust-bert](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-bert) are in the order of the 100s of MBs to GBs. This impacts the hardware requirements and model inference time. A GPU Setup is recommended.


### Sentiment Prediction
The BERT language model also was used to predict the sentiment of the text.

### Custom features
[Custom features](https://github.com/Philipp-Sc/rust-bert-fraud-detection/blob/main/package/src/build/feature_engineering/mod.rs) to improve the performance further have been added.

- word count information 
- punctuation, url, emoji and upper-case counts


## Feature Selection
Since generating the topic predictions requires a lot of compute the permutation feature [importance](https://github.com/Philipp-Sc/importance) is used to enable us to focus only on the most relevant topics.     
```
Permutation feature importance:
```

# Outlook
- **rust-bert-fraud-detection** may be improved by finding a better set of [topics/fraud indicators](https://github.com/Philipp-Sc/rust-bert-fraud-detection/blob/main/package/src/build/mod.rs) to be extracted and used for the classification.
- Feature selection: using more topic predictions (limited by available compute)
- Replace BERT with a better language model (zero shot classification, sentiment prediction, text embedding)
- ~~Improving the performance of the [Naive Bayes classifier](https://docs.rs/crate/linfa-bayes/latest), including adjustments to the used count vectorizer.~~
- ~~Replacing the Random Forest Regressor with a Neural Network.~~
- ~~Improving the KNN Regressor (find a better ```k``` value)~~
- Adding new custom features.
- More training data. (All models were trained on **English** text)

This project is part of [CosmosRustBot](https://github.com/Philipp-Sc/cosmos-rust-bot), which provides Governance Proposal Notifications for Cosmos Blockchains. The goal is automatically detect fraudulent and deceitful proposals to prevent users falling for crypto scams. The current model is very effective in detecting fake governance proposals.
